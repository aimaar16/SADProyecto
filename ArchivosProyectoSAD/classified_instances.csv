"We stayed 2 nights and 3 days during late November. 

Tyler & Erol was such great hosts! They are really open with communication. Checking in several times before check on and even after. They give instructions to the T, and that is extremely helpful for someone visiting someplace new. They are extremely flexible and accommodating. Their place is super convenient to downtown area. For our stay we left our car parked and walked everywhere. There's wifi, and Netflix available in the apartment. The heat in the apartment doesn't really ventilate through the entire place, so it was definitely cold and I would suggest bringing extra hoodies and sweats for sleeping in during the colder months. They were nice enough to provide a portable space heater in the bathroom and we ended up moving it between the bathroom ( showering & getting ready) and sleeping area (the rest of the day) a lot. This really helps warm up the sleeping area and made it more comfortable.

We had some issues with parking upon arrival (the building next door was doing construction and all the scaffolding was in the parking spot. They were super proactive and immediately took care of this issue that same day, renting us another spot at the same parking area. Thanks for that guys!

The block where the entrance of the building is, construction is going on and it blocks the entrance of the door. It's a little confusing, but everything is golden once you get into the apartment! I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area & will def recommend their place to everyone. For location, parking, and everything else, it's a great value!","9,0",2,0,10.0,-1.0

"This was our first time in Montréal and the apartment location, space, and value could not have been more perfect. The space itself is cozy, clean, minimal but with with character, with a parking space nearby and a little back porch. It's in the middle of the action, near restaurants and centrally located to all the things we wanted to do in Montréal. Kitchen was well appointed. Tyler was very helpful and responsive. We will be back for sure!","9,0",2,0,10.0,-1.0

"The host was argumentative when I told her there were no drinking glasses in the kitchen. She expected me to use one of the tiny little expresso cups. There were a sink full of dirty dishes from the time I got there until the time I left. We found a dead mouse on the kitchen counter one day. The bathroom sink was disgusting when I got there but cleaned, but not well, a couple days later. The outside door was not just unlocked but open when I got there because it was broken. It was fixed a couple days later. There were new windows being put in the week I was there. She failed to tell me that until after I was there. The workmen were there too early in the morning for me and made a lot of noise which effected my sleep. You needed to take a long bus ride to get to the grocery store. Luckily, there was a well stocked variety store just minutes away.","9,0",0,0,7.0,2.0

The room is as depicted in the photos. Clean and spacious. However, it is worth keeping in mind that the other areas of the house, namely, bathroom and kitchen are shared with many other people. Thus, it is hard to keep them clean.

"We had a great stay in the Sonder flat. It was perfectly located for us in the center of nightlife, great food and bars. As a large group of 6 the flat was a nice size and we slept very well at night. The only drawbacks for us was the lack of kitchen staples (most rental homes include ample sugar, salt, olive oil bottles, etc) and some issues with electricity (the only way to turn on bedroom lights was via turning on the living room light as well and there was lacking useable sockets in the bedrooms). Otherwise, we had a great time and would definitely return with larger groups again.","8,0",3,1,10.0,-2.0

The subway/metro is very close by to the apartment (perhaps a three minute walk) and allows for convenient travel to pretty much every aspect of Montreal.

Though I was not able to meet Laurence personally due to an emergency, she did make me feel welcomed by leaving fruit and bread in the apartment as a little snack for the next morning. In addition, there was a cute welcome note scrawled on a small chalkboard near the front door and a list of her favorite nearby hangout spots.

We were just steps from the scenic McGill University, a short walk to the vibrants bars & restaurants on St-Laurent Street, and were conveniently able to walk to many other places during our stay. The exterior of the building is beautiful and historical looking while the interior is updated, comfortable, and super clean... all while being very peaceful and serene when we needed a break from sightseeing. 

Tarek was a superb host -- he was very kind and communicative with us from the get-go and was flexible to some logistical issues we had.

"This is my worst Airbnb experience ever!

Tyler sent his friend to open the door for us, the apartment is dilapidated and old. When we stepped into the room, it smells like curry or some weird things. We thought it will disappear if we open the back door(no windows), but it became worse(there might be some restaurants close to the backyard). We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! 

We were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us! I tried to communicate with him but he just disappeared again!

We already reported this to Airbnb, one warning to the future guest: never trust the pictures!!","9,0",0,1,7.0,2.0

While the interior of the spaces matches the photos, what was not shown is the path that you have to walk thru to get to your basement apt entrance. After spending 10-15 min searching for a parking spot every night, you walk into a dark alley (about 10m), with smelly garbage dumped on both side of the alley. At / end of alley, turn left and you walk into 2 cars semi blocking the entrance to the basement units. There are woods and other dumps and garbage in the vicinity. There are spider webs that you will walk right into your face. You will have to squeeze thru 2 vehicles w/o dirtying your clothes before you get to  Ft dr #1. Unlock  dr #1, you walk into an unfinished hallway w/ woods piling in front of dr #2, which open into the basement apt. Imagine if you are dressed in some nice clothes, walking thru the above 3-4 times a day from the apt to yr car.  The place is very uncomfortable for following facts. 1. There is no bedboard, so you cannot sit up & read in bed. 2. The humidity in the unit is extremely high. There is a Dehumidifier put away in a small closet room, but we were not informed until we found it on the 2nd night. When i say extremely high, I meant you cannot even sit in the room w/o sweating. We use the dehumidifier (did not help much), and every 10 hrs or so, we need to empty a tank of water fr the dehumidifier tank before it overflows. 3. The outdoor temp at night after 9 pm during our stays (Aug 29-Sept 4) is < 20c. But the inside temp is at 28c. With the humidity and heat, we did not sleep for > 4 hrs per night. 4. On the 4th night, we found a fan (dusty and semi-working) in the closet room. It did little help after we have to wash off the dust on the fan. 5. We inform Ian that we are very uncomfortable & his reply was to buy a fan valued up to $40 and he will refund.  My message to Ian: Hi Ian. We are three nights into our stay and each night has been very uncomfortable. Even last night at 3am it was 28.5^C. Too warm, humid and hard to breathe. As we aren’t even able to open a window. Outside was under 20C Is there anything you can do to make or stay more tolerable. In addition to the comfortability issues, I also wanted to note a few things that are broken: The dryer handle The coffee machine ---------- Ian reply : Hello, maybe you can buy a fan up to 40$ that I would refund you? I have photos, videos to support my claim. Message me on F/b if anyone want to see.","9,0",1,0,9.0,0.0

"Kenny's place was perfectly situated, just a 3 min walk from the metro and right across the road from a cute coffee shop (with lots more great restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance). Kenny was very quick to respond to questions and provided info clearly. We liked that the apartment had Netflix already set up, and the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils if you want to save some money and cook for yourself. Bring your own food staples though, (salt, sugar, butter, etc) as there was no food in the apartment. Parking spot was easy to find, and we enjoyed the general feel of the place (brick walls, a good amount of light, big stack of clean towels). Our only real complaints were first, that the apartment is listed as 1.5 bathrooms, but there was only 1. As there were 4 of us, this wouldn't have been a deal breaker but we would have liked to know what to expect ahead of time. And second, the bed in the back bedroom was not very comfortable (front bedroom was fine, and no one slept in the middle bedroom so I can't speak for its comfort level). All in all, I would recommend Kenny's apartment, I do wish we'd come during the spring or summer months to enjoy the two private balconies and backyard!","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0

Allen was able to give us some recommendations for places to go in the area, and was very kind each time we interacted with him.

"Although this host was helping AirbnB and I out of a difficult situation by being available last minute, this unit was not what was pictured or described at all. It felt like we got a bait and switch unit. And, because apparently AirBnB’s are not allowed in the building, we were escorted they the back door/parking garage by hosts and asked to keep a low profile. The unit looked  like they had no longer cared. Area furniture, broken mirror in bedroom, all the pictures were crooked. It looked like a college student lived there. It was not at all what was advertised or pictured. It was terribly disappointing.","9,0",0,1,7.0,2.0

Once inside, there we're detailed printouts about the apt, parking and restaurants\bars in the area. The parking instructions greatly helped, as we don't know French and had no idea where we could and couldn't park. His place was simple and clean and provided just what we needed for a one night stay in Montreal. The heat was at a very comfortable level when we arrived and remained so throughout the night. The place is old, so be aware. That isn't a negative aspect necessarily, but don't expect hotel quality or the particulars of new or newly renovated bldg. AGAIN, there was nothing wrong with the place and we appreciated the charm of an old bldg. I would recommend staying here to anyone.

"Pros:
Excellent renovated unit.  Everything is new.
The location is close to stores for food (5 minute walk) and bus stop (1 minute walk).  The metro is near but about a 15 minutes walk away.
The kitchen is great for making meals, the temperature of the unit is adjustable and comfortable.
Strong wifi signal.
Lots of closet space.  Good lighting.
Lots of dishes and great nonstick pan.

The cons:
Noise late at night and early in the morning.
Being right at the bottom of the staircase means you hear everyone going up and down the stairs at all hours.
Being near the main entrance,  you hear the front door constantly slamming.
The location of the building is great however the traffic is fairly loud. Not recommended for light sleepers unless you can sleep with earplugs.
Construction noise from the building during the day.

It can feel a little further out from downtown, but It's not too long a walk, and there is a bus that stops right outside the apartment. It's very close to Mont Royal and many parks, so it's set in a beautiful location.

We also ran out of toilet paper (we were 2 women, stayed for 5 days, and there were 2 very small rolls when we got there). As for location, it was very close to the metro. The parking spot was clutch. We ended up not using our car at all (walked/took metro). As a side note, if you are sensitive to cigarette smell be aware that the hallways do have a strong odor. The apartment itself had none, but there were a lot of cigarette butts on the patio. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to check out the pool.

Long term parking was easy in a nearby garage, so I could park and then explore the city.  My friend took the #747 bus from the airport which dropped her off right on Eric's corner.  I slept in the very comfortable bed.  My friend choose the couch which folded down into a bed, rather than those pull out couch mattresses which can be uncomfortable. The neighborhood seemed in transition, but we felt safe and had no difficulties.  The location was convenient to Old Montreal, downtown, the entertainment district and museum area either walking or by the metro.  All and all an excellent choice.

It is the perfect place to enjoy the hip and charming Plateau neighborhood. The spacious first floor apartment is beautifully decorated in a minimal contemporary style. Everything seems to be newly renovated, and it was very clean. The modern kitchen is stylish, yet functional with new appliances and nice touches like a bonsai tree on the counter, and a Berkey water filter. There is a large deck off the kitchen that was the perfect spot for breakfast or a glass of wine in the evening. We checked in and out very easily, and the host was responsive if we had questions.

"Dominic's place is a very nice, clean, and affordable space to stay in Montreal. The apartment is located in a very nice, tree-lined neighborhood with supermarkets, restaurants, a park, and other amenities nearby. The bus stop to connect you to the metro is only half a block away and the metro station is only about a ten-minute bus ride away. Once you hop onto the metro, the center of the city of Montreal is only about five stops away.
The apartment is very clean and simply decorated (if you are the ""Bells and Whistles"" type of person, you won't like it as much as I did). The room is a very nice sizable room with a big window. The only drawback is that the window opens to a Boulevard and there is no escaping the outside noise whether from street traffic passing through or otherwise (if you are a light sleeper, beware of that fact and be prepared to get awakened by noise in the early hours of the morning). 
The host Dominic is very nice, very welcoming, easy going, hospitable beyond delight, and, above all, super accomodating. He gave me access  to everything in the kitchen, the livingroom, the back patio, and the bathroom. I really enjoyed my stay at Dominic's apartment and I highly recommend it to any travelers passing through Montreal (whether it's for a short stay  or a long haul)  DOMINIC  WAS  A  FANTASTIC  HOST..........!!!","10,0",3,1,10.0,0.0

"We very much enjoyed staying at Caroline's place. Our three daughters found the room with two bunk beds and one double very comfortable (although we had to hang a blanket on the window at night because there were no blinds and the street light bothered them).

The flat has everything you need and is quite comfortable. However, the second bedroom where we stayed had some minor issues. Absolutely nothing on the windows - two full walls facing the street and no door to the living room. When it was -29c at night we could not get the room any warmer than 12c. However, these really didn't bother us much and Caroline will probably have fixed all of this by next time.

The kitchen and family room were perfect.

The neighborhood is the best in Montreal. Fantastic bakery 3 blocks away. St-Viateur bagel just a block away. Excellent grocery store half a block away and open until midnight. Skating at Parc La Fontaine just a 15 minute walk. Metro station is a 10 minute walk away. Lots of shops and restaurants in the neighborhood.

The bed and breakfast was located in a great area - it's an easy walk to plenty of great restaurants and Mont Royal. We walked almost everywhere, but there was a metro stop very close. We would definitely stay here again!","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0

"We loved staying here. This apartment is a basic studio apartment so if you're looking for a luxury stay this is not your place...but for us it was perfect. We just needed place to crash in Montreal which was one of our stops in a very long road trip we were on. Having off street parking was a huge plus - we parked our car and didn't have to think about it or look at it for the duration of our stay. This apartment is in a fantastic location and we were able to walk or take the city bike system to every single place we wanted to go - museums, Old Montreal, shopping, and restaurants.","9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0

The apartment is very clean and they allow you to use the kitchen to cook.
They both speak English and French,Collin is German and Sandy is really good in Spanish so the language should not be a problem.

"What a great spot and location!  Loved the decor and the open concept.  The pool table was a great addition.  The kids enjoyed playing, while the parents took time to relax after taking all the great local activities.  The loft includes all that you need, plus personal touches to make it feel very inviting. Great location on the boarder of downtown Montreal and Old Montreal. I loved walking out the door onto the street and being in the heart of the town.  The Pub Victoria is a great little local pub that is hopping which is next door.  It has a good, little outdoor patio for a pint.  Location is perfect (although we did not use the bikes their is a convenient bike rental location (bixi) right out front).  The hosts we very quick to respond to inquiries.  They offered all kinds of support including a professionally prepared introduction booklet (outlining house rules and need to know info) and a separate local activities/dinner suggestion booklet. They are very professional hosts who help to reassure you (as this was one of our first AirBnB experiences). They preempt your needs and provide all the required communications upfront opposed to us asking them for info, They already know what info most travellers are looking for. The only thing to note, is upon arrival, the common area which include hallway and stairs are very dated and not inline with the quality of the loft (yet functional) being a very “Old Montreal” building. But once you open the door to the loft, you are relieved). Great experience.","9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0

"The space was a little smaller than expected epically a space that advertises it can accommodate eight. 
.
 Since the bedrooms were so close to the common area / kitchen and or bathroom we all had to agree upon a time to sleep and wake so as not to disturb one another.  If eight guests sleep here they would probably be sleeping in the living room which is very close to the kitchen and bathroom and will surly wake anyone sleeping in it.
.
 There was a T.V. but it didn’t have any channels so it seemed a little redundant to have. 
.
All in all the space accommodated our needs that being to sleep, shower and eat but had we wanted to spend any time in the space, much more than we did we I would be on top of one another.  
.
 On a positive not the bed I slept in was VERY comfortable and did not move when shifted in my sleep so my partner was not disturbed.

 Cafe's were very close by with great coffee.

The place was even bigger than it looked in the pictures, and just the perfect size for our needs.  It was clean when we got there, and the bed had fresh sheets and there were towels for us to use.  One thing we wished for was sheets for the futon, since we were not sharing the bed.  There was also no space for us to unpack, because the bureau drawers were full.  Other than those two things, the place was great and not stuffy at all, though it was on the fourth floor.  It's also in a great location, very conveniently located near lots of good restaurants, the waterfront, and the bike path along the river.

"I had the pleasure of staying at Andrée’s place for a week and I highly recommend it. Andrée was such an excellent, attentive host. Once I arrived, she took the time to show her house and to provide tips on places and events. The kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, and dishes so I had everything I needed to cook my meals. She also made sure everything was fine during my stay. I needed an iron board and iron for a business meeting and she gladly made them available. I really enjoyed staying in a traditional French residential neighborhood with several options of groceries, restaurants, and shops. The apartment is well located, close to the blue line station Outremont that takes you downtown in thirty minutes. It is also relatively easy to come from/go to the airport (about $30 uber trip). The apartment has paid laundry (four loonies) in the building basement so it was a perk not to leave the building. Unfortunately, I came during the winter so the days were cloudy, snowy, and gray so I didn’t have the chance to see the greenery Montréal is famous for. The city wasn’t quiet, though. Montréal en Lumière was taking place on Avenue Sainte Catherine during the weekend so I was able to check a famous city festival. I’ll definitely be back in the summer.","10,0",3,1,10.0,0.0

Les maisons ont toutes un charme certain, dans leur style urbain de début du XXe. L'appartement mis à disposition par Sarah et Aristide se trouve sous leur logement - de sorte qu'on peut résoudre immédiatement toute question avec eux - au rez-de-chaussée de leur maison. Tout y est charmant, des murs en brique au sol en parquet (et en pente!) au mobilier cosy et fonctionnel à la fois. On y loge aisément à 3 grâce au fauteuil convertible en lit dans le petit salon.

The apartment is as advertised--very sweet with two small balconies, a full service kitchen (including spices), and an air-conditioner, as some of the stand-outs (and the latter was very helpful in July). The thing is that you won't want to spend that much time there because the neighborhood is amazing--which was also accurately advertised. We walked or took the metro everywhere and never used our car (we lucked out and found a parking spot right after the street had been cleaned and all the other cars had to move). There are so many great restaurants, cafes and boutiques nearby, and also a sweet park right at the top of the street. We walked to Mont Royal (and then walked to the top for an amazing view), and walked to the Metro stop to get to downtown (for free concerts at the Jazz Festival), the old port, and the Jean Talon market. Also, Libby was very helpful and available via email (and if my phone worked, I assume text as well); has lots of maps and brochures in the apartment for you to look at and use; and her housecleaner, who met us and gave us the keys, was lovely and full of tips about the city.

We were able to cook there and it was a good size for 2 people. There is a big park right across the street that was nice to walk in and if you want to, you could walk to downtown and save the hassle of driving. Rafael was also a great host and was very quick about responding to questions we had! He also left some snacks out for us and made staying there easy.

She made sure I had directions to get in well, took me to the grocery store to make sure I knew where it was, and was generally a friendly, happy host. One thing not mentioned in the listing is that this is a triplex - Maureen lives on the first floor, I stayed in one of the four bedrooms on the third floor, and she was remodeling the second floor to create four more bedrooms. Guests have great privacy if they want it.

I have to mention that there were ants in the kitchen - Maureen knows and is working to eradicate them, but anyone who's really bothered by bugs might be put off.

"I spent three nights in this apartment, and liked it very much.
The location is near a big park, and it took me about 15 minutes to walk to the nearest metro station. A supermarket can be reached by a short 3 minute walk.
Entrance to the apartment is from a street level door, and the apartment is one floor up, reached by a staircase inside the building.
The apartment itself felt a bit like home. The wooden floors are creaky and a little bit worn in places, but not a problem at all, at least for me. There are also a few minor drops of paint on the floors, but again, not really a problem. The furniture is generally comfortable and the bedroom mattress is relatively firm. I really appreciated the light blocking curtains and blinds in the bedroom. I was not bothered by traffic noise from the street during my stay, and found the place quiet. What I also really appreciated about this apartment is how clean it was: Absolutely spotless! Also, communication with my host was flawless! Needed a hairdryer and got a reply immediately. And the hairdryer was delivered very soon after. And I got the same fast response and delivery when I couldn't find a can opener.
All in all,  I was very glad to stay in this apartment, and impressed by my host's swift and positive replies to my requests.

If you’re looking to have the least amount of communication and just a clean place to stay for the night, this is it for you.

"Fantastic location in Old Montreal. Very easy to find and get into. It seems like most of the building, if not all, are AirBnB units and that the host owns a few of them. I didn't have any problems with the building or room key pass. The walls are very thin and I could hear the neighbors doing things like using the washroom and opening/closing the blinds but thankfully that's the only noise we had to deal with and it wasn't a big deal.

The air mattress was easy to set up (it has a built in pump) and there were plenty of linens to make the bed with. The bed and the air mattress were comfortable. The duvets are thin but warm. The air mattress was easy to deflate and put away.

The shower has really good flow and the water is nice and warm. The handheld unit leaks a bit of water even when it's not activated so be careful that you have it pointed well away from the shower door or else it will leak onto the floor as a few inches of the door seal is ripped/missing.

I didn't use the kitchen at all so I can't comment on it. The only thing I did notice though is that there is no microwave, but there is one of those small toaster oven and an actual oven if you need it.

We had an issue the first night with the heat and had a cold night and morning. There was a lot of back and forth with the host as they weren't understanding me when I was telling them that the thermostat would not let me set it higher than 20, but they solved the problem by the next night (they provided me with details on how to reset the thermostat so now it can be set higher than 20) so hopefully it won't be a problem going forward for anyone else.

Overall a decent stay. It's a bare bones place but it's worth it for the location. If you're there for at least a few days pick up some extra toilet paper as they don't leave you a lot and bring some shopping bags so you can change the bathroom garbage.","10,0",1,1,10.0,0.0

We got the information that there was no keys for the room we were staying in. After checking out thogh the host contacted me to ask where I put the keys.

"This is a terrific location from which to explore Montreal! The apartment is really spacious and comfortable, and is just as pictured. We felt very safe in this neighborhood. And we were very close to everything in Old Montreal. The hosts were super about communicating - they provided plenty of clear instructions up front and were very responsive when we had questions. Their advance instructions also included a lot of area recommendations, and the one recommended restaurant we tried (Olive & Gourmando) was super. There were minor issues (dishwasher went on the fritz) that did not affect the enjoyment of our stay...stuff like this can happen anywhere. One caveat: if you arrive late (after 11) and park in the lot across the street, you will only be allowed to purchase parking until 5 AM and then will have to return to the lot, at which point you can purchase for a longer stretch (up to 60 hours, as far as I can tell...and we were able to extend after that as well). Everything is very close...you won't need your car.","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0

The home is only a few blocks from the Jean Talon Farmer's Market, the largest farmer's market in North America. The kitchen in the home is full of everything you would need to cook for dinner. There is even a rooftop terrace for dining. So many great things. The one drawback is that the listing says there is air conditioning and it worked so poorly, I don't think you should count on that. It was very hot in Montreal the weekend we went and we just couldn't get the house cool with the air conditioner. Other than that, everything was great and I highly recommend this home!","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0

"My husband and I spent a long weekend in Montreal for my birthday. We found Philippe's place to be a wonderful value for the money and it was a very comfortable apartment. It's a basement level unit with Philippe living right upstairs so the host is always conveniently nearby. We found that he responded to messages quickly.  We met him during check-in when he showed the apartment to us and pointed out where we can find items we may need.  He gave us the keys, showed us how to lock the doors and walked us through how to park. He was very pleasant. There were many thoughtful items left for us: a couple muffins for breakfast, water, juice and beer in the fridge, plenty of tea in the cupboard. The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans, a variety of dishes, etc. The mattress was firm and while I like a softer mattress (my husband prefers one that is firm!) I found that I woke up well rested and comfortable.

We found the location of the apartment to be absolutely wonderful.  It was a short walk (about 5 mins) to the Biodome, Botanical Gardens and Pie IX metro station. The apartment is located on a wonderfully quiet residential street and we felt very safe leaving our car parked on the street. Near the apartment is a grocery store as well as 3 local parks that were beautiful to walk through. We couldn't have been happier with the location of this space. ","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0

Super pro: the parking spot. Parking in Montreal can be a nightmare. Not here! If you have a car, this is a huge perk and really made coming and going so easy. Location-wise, if you have a car, the house is conveniently situated and not too far from many sights.

"Thank You for being such a gracious host Hamza. I could not have asked for a better host for our weekend getaway. 

The place was fantastic. It is clean, modern, spacious and inviting. Plenty of clean linens and extra blankets. The patio and its large double sliding doors opens up the space to the outdoors. Access to the place is simple and off a main street. Parking can be tough to find at times if you do drive, but I find that true for Montreal generally speaking.

Location was convenient, about a 10 min uber ride to downtown. about a 5 min walk to the closest metro station. Close to some popular restaurants, most of which are about 15-20 min walk.

Hamza was a great host. Checked in with us to make sure things were going well. He was always helpful, responded quickly to enquiries and questions. Ensured that our stay was enjoyable and that was his top priority. I had peace of mind while we were at this place.

"Grace & Irwin were amazing hosts! I had to change my check-in time quite a bit on short notice, but they were very easy to communicate with and arranged a new check-in time without any problems =) 
The room is super clean, quiet, the airconditioning is very convenient and the bathroom has everything that is needed (water pressure really is quite low, as mentioned by the hosts). 
The location was excellent, I was actually able to walk everywhere, including nice restaurants, old town, Mount Royal, bus terminal etc.. I was really surprised that such a quiet room in such a nice house could be so close to all major attractions! Would definetly stay here again and can recommend it to anyone who is travelling alone and needs a safe, nice and accomodating place to stay! ","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0
"The place is pretty much just one giant room with some dividers. The location is great but the house rules are rigid. 
A high cleaning fee and then they order you to do most of the cleaning work/prep.
The beds are by the windows so the morning sun will wake you up unless you're used to sleeping through that. Street noise is moderate. 
The place was clean and close to the metro.","9,0",3,0,10.0,-1.0

Pros: Very affordable, good value, bedroom and common areas were clean, quiet and bed was very comfy. Also the host is prompt to answer. 

Cons: Bedroom is quite bright during the night (curtains not thick enough to block street lights and door is made of glass). Men's washroom was quite dirty. I used the women's one which was clean. They are individual washrooms so I didn't understand why splitting sex.","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0

Only warning is that his neighbor is crazy and possibly something mentally wrong with.  She started banging on our wall excessively when we made some noise at 8:30 in the morning and then told James that we were up at 6am doing all sorts of things while we were sleeping.....
Not necessarily the spot to go if you're going to make any noise in the bedroom.  Otherwise it was great with lots of instruction manuals and info.","9,0",2,1,10.0,-1.0

It's a vibrant place that you can feel the fun atmosphere from the plaza and on the street. Late night on weekends could be too noisy if you like to sleep in a really quiet room.

"The apartment was great. We couldn't have asked for a better place at this price.  The location was perfect as it was walking distance from many iconic places.  Bars, parks, clubs, places to eat, and the metro were all easy to walk to.  Sebastién made check in and check out very easy for us. His hospitality was amazing and the apartment was very accommodating for our group. Montreal was beautiful and if we were to come back, our hope would be to stay at this apartment again. The place was comfortable, clean, and overall a relaxing place to stay for a visit to Montreal.","10,0",3,1,10.0,0.0

Quiet street with rather simple street parking (outside of two weekly restrictions), we had no problem finding a spot to park on the block. First floor location made it easy to unpack and apartment came with heating and AC unit. The bathroom was just the right size with a shower and bathtub.

I told her it would be nice if we could sleep on separate beds, and when we arrived she had prepared an extra bed for us! We had access to all common spaces and amenities, and I have to say this apartment is SO charming and welcoming! The kitchen was my big favorite. The apartment is not in the center of town but very conveniently located: in a quiet residential area just 5 min away from a subway station and a supermarket. And also from that subway station is at the beginning of the gay village, on St Catherine street (the one with the rainbow), where there are many bars and restaurants. Noémie provided us with lots of tips about the surrounding areas. I just wish we had more time to hang out with her!

"Place was very new. However, because one host had given me a lower price than she should have on a month long stay, there was no attempt to provide the basic things I wanted as a guest like salt, pepper, sugar, coffee, tea, toaster, kettle, cutlery trays, hand soap, shower curtain, bath mat, facecloths, space for my folded clothes (it was all taken up by linens while the top shelves in cupboards, which I am too short to reach, were all empty) and most importantly, NOT ONE HANGER in the entire place. In fact, the other host said  that because the first host had misquoted the price, he would accept the mistake but that the place came as is. I spent over $150 on things that had already been provided in the many other Airbnb lodgings I've been in. Did I take it all with me when I left? You bet I did, it's my hard earned money. 

In addition, the first host told me that they would give me a good review even if the place looked like I'd had a ""hangover party"" when I left, in return expected a 5 review or they'd be kicked off Airbnb. Funny, I paid a cleaning fee and left the apartment pretty darn clean as I had washed all the towels and swept the floors (no vacuum) the day before I left. Yes, I asked to extend for another month rather than have to find another one and move but I was willing to pay the higher price rather than go through another move. They had other bookings , two that I saw in the month but I found a much better place for less so I lucked out big time! All in all, the three places at that location run by these two hosts are nicely decorated, good location but after dealing with these hosts, I won't rent from them again.","10,0",0,1,7.0,3.0
"The apartment itself was comfortable and the heating worked well. There is a tiny television but you shouldn’t be watching TV anyway right? For those who are going to use the indoor parking, it would be wise to park at the end of the 15 min parking for the embassy suites because you will have to go up to the apt to get the parking pass and drive around one way streets to get to the parking garage. If you park at the 15 min zone, you can probably just back up 10 ft to get to the garage. There is an entrance to the indoor connected montreal across the street and you can walk all the way to the eaton centre in about 25 minutes or the place des artes in about 15 minutes. Just be sure to map it out beforehand.","9,0",3,0,10.0,-1.0

One block form the Metro station with bixi bikes even closer. Galley kitchen with pots, pans, glasses, cutlery etc but no supplies (salt, pepper, sugar, oil etc.) Good for reheating leftovers or pre made meals. It was quiet as it's in the back of the building although there is only one window, the sliding door in the bedroom, and when the heat exchanger for the building is running it is fairly loud as it's directly below the door. When we were there the screen door was  unusable, just leaning against the side of the building and the garbage can was full, stinky and 3 feet from the sliding bedroom door. Fortunately it wasn't really hot while we were there so we only had to close the door once because of the stink. I noticed a bike rack in the backyard, good spot if you brought your own bikes although at $100/night you're probably going to spend another $5/day for a bixi pass if you want to bike.","9,0",2,0,10.0,-1.0

"Martin is an amazing host. He is very communicative and available. Check-in was easy and the place is truly a zen house. I used to live in Montreal so new location was best for those wanting to live the local life but his place is truly next to everything. From wonderful brunch place less than 2 blocks away to fresh daily croissant to bars to restaurants to metro.. I can go on.
When we arrived, Martin had left us personal notes about the place, with his phone number, map of the city, trash day during the week an other uselful information. We were able to find parking on the street without using parking permits but he had left us parking permits in case we needed them at a very affordable fee. The place was spotless and I felt is bigger than the pictures show. Lots of storage for your clothes as the closets are empty and ready to use. I will come back to this place next time I come back to Montreal for sure. Martin is very friendly and available and his place is wonderful. Some mentioned the toilet is a separate room than shower and sink, its true but didnt bother me. I didnt use the bbq but its a brand new big one, better than the one shown on the pictures.
Martin's place is the best place to live the local life while staying in a stress free very quiet place next to absolutely everything. If you're into road noise, construction driving you crazy and high rises, go downtown. If you want true Montreal experience, stay at the zenhouse.

Thanks Martin for the wonderful hospitality and great stay!","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0

"Tyler was a very nice host, he made all instructions clear and was just an email away if we needed anything. The place looked like the pictures on the inside and there were no unpleasant suprises. For our purposes there was nothing lacking, although there might not be enough cooking utensils to make much more than pasta.
The parking space is about a block and a half away and a bit tough to get into. We never needed my car once though because the subway station was just as close and brought us anywhere we wanted to go.","9,0",2,0,10.0,-1.0
"Melanie's apartment is located in a great section of the Plateau and easily walkable to a lot of shopping, stores, restaurants, and the metro. The roof deck is phenomenal, and in my opinion, is what sets this listing apart. You will certainly want to spend your evenings out there, and if you like to cook, plan to have some dinners up there too! We also didn't have any issue finding parking around the corner, which was a plus. Two recommendations - Le Pegase is around the corner and is BYOB, and Les Co'Pains d'Abord has phenomenal croissants in the morning for breakfast.

One caveat, as others mentioned, is that the apartment is not air conditioned. This is not that big of a deal during the day, but the bedroom does not have a portable AC unit either, and that made sleeping quite difficult all three nights. The only way that we could sleep was with the windows wide open, but that let all the light and noise from busy Ave Papineau into the room, and it was still pretty hot at that. The second bedroom is dark but has no windows to open and thus was too hot. We also only had one fan, which did not serve to cool down the room enough. I imagine that this is not an issue in the fall and spring, which are probably the best times to rent this apartment since you will still be able to use the roof deck but will also be able to keep the windows closed at night. Also please note that when we were there it was swelteringly hot, with nights in the upper 70s and high humidity. I imagine that cool summer nights may not be too bad either. We did know about the lack of AC when we rented the apartment, so it wasn't like Melanie was not honest, but if you don't like humidity or light/noise when you sleep, you may want to wait until the fall or spring to book this place.","10,0",1,1,10.0,0.0
"Really great Airbnb experience! Tended to forget how small the unit was because it was set up so efficiently that it seemed larger than it was. Really friendly and quick service, and the thoughtful touches like laundry tokens, toiletries and recommendations for places to go were really appreciated. Had a little trouble finding parking but was warned about that and the place was within walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants so only had to worry about finding parking once. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy Montréal!","10,0",3,0,10.0,0.0

Daniel is truly friendly and honest, and an absolutely natural host. It was obvious he has a genuine interest in people which made him effortlessly accommodating and easy to talk to. The cats were no different, clearly they have learned a lot from him. 

The apartment was beautiful, an incredible space filled with unique décor, furniture, and art, much of which was custom made by Daniel himself. The private room no doubt matched the rest of the place, comfortable, clean, and stylish. 

The location could not be better, with transit in all directions just steps outside (including the Metro) and right in the middle of a lively and creative neighbourhood.

"Ivonne's place was clean and beautiful and I had the place to myself, which was great. She had an alarm system so I felt safe and it was easy to check-in. Location was great, in the middle of the Plateau. The only issue, which was quite disappointing is that her place did not provide wifi although it said on the website said that it was part of the amenities. It was also annoying that she did not warn me of this and that it took her quite a while to tell me and I had to text and ask her multiple times about it before she told me that it had been cut off. This was frustrating for me since I was there apartment hunting and thus was dependent on wifi for this. She also stated she would reimburse me for this but still has not yet and it has been a few weeks now. I understand she was travelling at the time but I would have at least appreciated better communication about this. If there were not issues with the wifi or communication, I wouldn't have any more complaints about her place.","9,0",2,1,10.0,-1.0

I went to Montreal for a conference and it was also my first time to be in Canada. Frédérique's home is very stylish and you can tell that she made a great effort to decorate the place.  The most important thing was that she is very generous to share the nice apartment with her guests. I could access the living room, balcony and the well-equipped kitchen. The oven, washing machine and dryer were new and they were functioning very well. There are also two lovely cats. After a whole day conference, it was really nice to relax with the cats and some nice homemade food and local wine. I also love the brunch place Frédérique showed me. The food was so delicious.

"Yanick was a great host - very quick to respond and accommodating - and his place was great. I had been a bit concerned from the photos that it might be chilly being an older place that looked a bit like a converted attic, but when I arrived it was nicely warm and I didn't have to make any temperature adjustments. The place is very private and secure, with the extra benefit of a keyed common entry and keyed private entry. I had expected something like a single room in a hostel-like setting but it's actually more like a hotel including an elevator. All the photos are accurate and the location is great - easily walkable distances to explore the city. My best AirBnb experience yet and I'd definitely stay again.","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0

"We had a wonderful stay at Karl's place. Although we never actually met in person, he was always very quick to answer our questions. We were there in September, and the window boxes were full of geraniums. This made it an absolutely lovely place to have our morning coffees. That living room gets so much sunlight! We were also particularly drawn to this place because of the available bikes, but everything we wanted to see and do was so close that we ended up walking everywhere instead. The only downside was that the bed is ever so slightly uneven so that both people end up sinking into the middle. This would be fine for a couple but maybe annoying for friends sharing a bed. Upshot: the big couch is divinely comfortable. All in all, it's bright, unique, and well located. We would definitely recommend it. ","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0

"There are two key components to my review.  The first is Location, Location and Location.  You could not want for a better place to stay in Montreal.  Firstly, you’re barely five minutes from the Atwater Market to get all those amazing goodies for your meals (which we did!) and five minutes from one of the Metro station that will get you to most of the key sightseeing places in Montreal.  We didn’t use our rental car during our three day stay there.  On top of that, walk out the apartment door and whether you went left or right, there was an amazing selection of cafes to choose from.  

Secondly and most important is the apartment itself.  The apartment had everything you could want for your stay, a comfortable bed, great living area and so on.  Then add in the personal touches left by the host like fresh flowers, coffee, etc. and you can see why I can’t recommend Alfredo’s apartment highly enough.  I’ll certainly won’t hesitate staying there again should I return to Montreal in the future.","10,0",4,0,10.0,0.0

The interior brick walls were a nice touch, the floors were a little uneven in certain areas - we got used to it fairly quickly and it definitely added to the rustic feel of the apartment. It is also in a great location - close to various cafes, shops, and in the middle of two main streets. The kitchen was stocked with the essentials for cooking - as well as coffee and tea which is always a plus. Internet was easy to connect to and very fast - there was also a small, yet loud, stereo system available for use in the living room. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend!","10,0",3,0,10.0,0.0
L'hôte était très organisé et gentil. Nous avons bien apprécié l'efficacité d'acquérir les clés et de nous avoir montré l'endroit qui était facilement accessible. C'était notre première expérience avec Airbnb alors on ne savait pas trop à quoi s'attendre. Nous avons aimé les petits détails rajoutés comme le journal édition Grand Prix sur la table à notre arrivée (la raison de notre visite). Très belle endroit que je recommande à tous! :),"10,0",2,1,10.0,0.0
"Daniel, put simply, is a consummate host. This is my first Airbnb experience and he has set the bar high. From the get-go, he was proactive in communicating with his guests. For example, by giving me directions to his place and informing me that the roads were closed due to a festival before I arrived, so that I could plan an alternative route to his place. He even greeted me at the door and gave me a quick tour around Montreal as it was my first time visiting Quebec. Bilingual and affable, Daniel ensures that his guests are comfortably well-settled, especially for English speakers who may have difficulties navigating around Montreal. His apartment is clean and his two cats, Paco and Baboo, are absolutely adorable. Depending on your preferences, Daniel can be a guide and friend, or simply a host if you wish it be. It is his versatile approach to hosting that impresses me the most.

Location-wise, his place is steps away from the Mont-Royal métro and in the heart of the French Ghetto. Good food is found everywhere. La Banquise and Fameux for Poutine, L'Avenue for brunch, Yokato Yokabai for ramen, pâtisserie kouign aman and plenty more. For bibliophiles, there is a ton of francophone bookshops nearby.

In short, I had a pleasant stay and got to experience a (very) local taste of Montreal. Merci beaucoup, Daniel!","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0

The apartment was very nice and in an awesome location. It was clean and comfortable. The only downside was that the air conditioning was broken so the nights were a little hot.

"Amal must be the most responsive host we ever had. We never met in person but he provided timely support nevertheless. The location is very good especially if you are new to Montreal; it’s walkable everywhere. One thing to note is the the unit is advertised as 1.5 bath. I understood that to mean 1 full bath and 1 half bath. This was not the case; the unit only has one larger than normal full bath. Perhaps there’s a a difference in American vs Canadian understanding of 1.5 bath! There’s indoor parking FYI for additional cost but it’s worth it especially in winter.  Thanks for being a good host, Amal!","9,0",1,0,9.0,0.0

"Daniel is wonderful ! A kind, generous, creative and intuitive person. He will make you feel welcome and give you any tips you need for your trip, as well as be intuitive to you and your needs if you want to stay private. 

The superhost title is so well deserved. 

His home quickly becomes your home - it is beautifully laid out, clean, tidy and a great place to spend time in, or arrive back to after a day of sightseeing / work.

It is right by the subway so only a 2/3mins way. Near by restaurants and bars, shops, swimming pool, park ! Everything. 

I cannot recommend daniels air bnb more highly.

"Sebastien was A1 out of the gate. Throughout the booking and arriving phase Sebastian communicated clearly and effectively. He was very helpful when we needed suggestions for parking. The unit was in spotless condition and was better than the photos. He even has a handy tour guide booklet printed off for guests. The location was prime for exploring downtown Montreal. It was just a 3-4 minute was from the Metro. 

Unfortunately our visit was tainted by a burglary. The backdoor appears to have been unlocked. We didn't use the door and were unaware of its existence until departing the residence. Sebastien is sure that it was left locked. We had left around 3 pm and returned around 3 Am after attending Kanye West at the Bell center and going out on the town. During the break and enter my personal laptop was stolen and a closet door was destroyed. The police came and there was little they could do without the tracking software installed on my laptop. I do believe Sebastien is a great host and has a great spot, but I was very unimpressed with his handling of the event. He had little to no concern about the loss of my possessions and even tried to charge us 400$ for the damages to his closet. Airbnb costumer service throughout this process was useless and made settling back into things at home quite stressful. This experience has caused me to consider traditional methods of lodging for future trips. Although, I think this was an unfortunate coincidence it certainly put a damper on our trip.

"The apartment is very clean - I've stayed in 20+ Airbnbs and this was probably the cleanest. It is spacious without clutter. Although it would sleep and provide plenty of space for two couples, I found the single couch to be a limiting factor for comfort seating. We visited in March with temps in the 30's with our two year old - the apartment was plenty warm and very quiet. It's a short walk to the metro and bus - there is a great little grocer a couple doors down and an excellent bodega selling regional craft beer. Plentiful restaurants a short walk or metro ride away. It was a great ""neighborhood"" experience in Montreal.","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0

The check-in process could have been smoother as we had not received adequate information on what floor or apartment that was for us, however, Zaki was quick to reply when we texted for more info and was very flexible in regards to our stay.

The location is two blocks from Mount Royal.  Wonderful boutiques, groceries, cafes, and restaurants. Our only issue was the walk to the metro.  We tried the bus, but there wasn't always one. For avid walkers, the 20 minutes walk to and fro would not be an issue. I resorted to parking on the street near the metro then walked. Not a big deal.","9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0

"As a ""virgin"" Airbnb-er this trip and experience has made me a believer in the whole process! Colin and Mel were beyond amazing and accommodating. I felt like I was staying with friends rather than strangers. They are both beyond friendly and helpful in making your way around the city :) The flat is in a beautiful area of the city, surrounded by cafes and boutiques. All the rest of the hustle and bustle is within walking distance or biking distance, as I opted for. There is a bixi bike stand just around the corner from Colin's place and this made it super convenient to come and go. The room and bathroom were clean!! This was a huge test for me...and I was grateful for the cleanliness factor. The apartment was hot while I was there (outside temp of +37 with the humidity) but there is a fan in the room which allowed me to sleep well at night.  I suggest ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, I go everywhere with mine, but I know I would have struggled with the outdoor traffic and creeky floors if I didn't have them :)

"We liked the location. Steve was super responsive and overall a great host. There was an electricity breakdown at 11pm on the night of our check-in, and he sent someone to fix it. He also provided a parking space next door for an  additional fee. The bathroom was supplied with toiletries: soap, shampoo, body gels, toilet paper. 

If you are *allergic* to pets fur, this might be important to you: we found some on furniture legs in the 2nd bedroom. We spent most of the time outside exploring Montreal and it only caused reaction when we were playing on the floor with a kid, but still it isn’t something I would expect from an apartment where pets aren’t allowed. 

I hope the points above are easy to fix and recommend Steve as a great host to anyone who wants to spend some quality time in Montreal.","9,0",2,1,10.0,-1.0

The location, with easy access to public transit (both bus and metro) to get downtown or around southwest Montreal and also being a short walk from the St. Lawrence River and its walk/bike pathway, can't be beat.

During probably the busiest weekend in Montreal due to Osheaga music festival, another AirBnB host canceled last minute, leaving my friends and I without a place to stay. With the help of AirBnB and Marine, she accommodated a large group of my friends to stay last minute. She responded immediately and was in touch during the entire re-booking process. She and her boyfriend Damien bought us a bottle of wine to welcome us into their home, provided us multiple pairs of keys and checked up on whenever we needed. Best of all, the place is in a super cool and spacious loft, with really fun and interesting decor. I 100% recommend anyone considering to visit Montreal to stay with Marine.

"If I had to describe my stay at Laura's in one word it would be 'AMAZING'! Luckily, I have more space. 

The room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). 

I've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. 

The neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!

The space is airy and vast. It feels great to be in, has big windows and lots of light.

Lumineux, coloré, plein de lumière naturelle et entièrement équipée avec tout ce que vous aurez besoin pour rendre votre séjour à Montréal très agréable. Son apart est situé à super proche de bons endroits pour manger et visiter, y compris le marché Jean-Talon (un must-see pour tous ceux qui visitent la ville). Anouchka été très réactif par SMS - je vous conseille de rester a sa maison pour tous ceux qui visitent Montréal!

I had the opportunity to stay at Grace and Irwin's condo; this was the first time I use Airb&b services and I was very pleased.  Grace is a wonderful lady, I spend a few minutes with her drinking tea.  I did not feel too well with a bad cold and she made sure I had some of her special delicious jasmine tea.  Their son is a wonderful young man who also invited me for a cup of tea while Grace and Irwin were out.  The place is impeccably clean and comfortable close to the nicest areas of Montreal, on Maisonneuve Rue and St. Catherine Rue just behind the condominium, many many restaurants.  Easy access to the metro and walking distance to downtown Montreal. The place is full of life surrounded by young kids from Concordia University, McGill University and Montreal. Overall a wonderful experience.  ","9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0

"Let me start by saying the pictures do not do this loft justice!! The loft is huge and was so comfortable for my family and I. The hosts provided my family with THE BEST recommendations, which gave us a local perspective that my family really enjoyed!! The apartment is stunning and was extremely clean. The beds were super comfy and had enough privacy for all of us. The location was simply out of this world - you are legitimately in the heart of Old Montreal and yet the metro stop was steps away which made it super easy to get to the BELL Center for a hockey game! Everything was perfect from start to finish. It has been the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! My family and I thank you Explore MTL!","9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0

Had a little trouble getting the master lock open but eventually got it. Sebastian was very responsive, nice and helpful with any issues or questions. Didn't have to wait long for him to respond at all. If anything, the bathroom could have been a little more cleaner but overall the place is just like it is described in the posting and pictures.

Two things to note: as stated in the description, the building is currently under construction. It was very loud for 2 days of the trip but we didn't hear it at all on the 3rd day.

"The reason I booked Jason's place is because I attended a conference at the Palais de Congres de Montreal. For the price, I would say that I made a good choice! My friend and I drove to Montreal and we didn't arrive until around 2 am. Jason gave very detailed instructions for self check in which made it really convenient as I wouldn't want to bother him at that time. After we had arrived in  Montreal, we commuted throughout our stay. It is a 7-min walk to the metro and I would say that the neighborhood is pretty quiet and safe (there were times when we went home around 1 am). Jason told me that we could park our car in the backyward which was a bit difficult to find since Jason did not respond when I asked him about it (not a big deal though because my friend and I figured it out eventually). The condo is just as how it looks like in pictures, and I especially loved the kitchen and the bathroom. There were essentials he left for us like soap, shampoo, towels etc. During our stay, we lost Wi-Fi for about a day and Jason fixed it as soon as he can. Overall, our stay was nice. I would book his place again. Thanks Jason!","9,0",3,1,10.0,-1.0

"Anastasia's place is an incredibly stylish and unique get away located within walking distance of a number of great bars, restaurants, cafes, and stores. The space is open and welcoming with large opaque windows and plenty of natural light. Anastasia is easy to reach and responds in a very timely manner if you have any questions or need recommendations. While freezing in the outside, the place stays nice and warm throughout each room which was a big plus for us, non-Montreal-natives. There are plenty of kitchen supplies and utensils, but they can be hard to find as the home has a very 'lived-in' feel and layout. Also, there is no TV, which wasn't an issue, but thought it should be mentioned (luckily there was a speaker with an aux to play some music). The shower can be a little tricky to get the right temperature and the shower door doesn't close fully (wasn't kidding when I said the space is 'open'). But, all of these minor details aside, this space is unlike any other airbnb or hotel you could find and it is absolutely worth staying in.","9,0",2,1,10.0,-1.0

"Three friends and I stayed at Philippe and Sandra's lovely apartment for the weekend. We arrived later than expected, but Sandra was very flexible and kind about this. The apartment itself was well equipped except for some small things, which was easily amendable as there is a grocery store just a few blocks away. The hosts were personable and sweet, and left many helpful books and maps to ease our exploration of Montreal. As far as location, we were able to walk all over the Plateau neighborhood easily, full of great restaurants and shops. There was easy access to the subway from the apartment to get to old town, downtown, etc. in just a matter of minutes, though walking was our preferred mode of transportation!

"Our stay at Karl’s was fantastic. We felt welcomed in his home, and not just because in the cute park across the street was a Fa Lun Da Fa marching band performance that put a little spring in our step. The front door key was a bit sticky to open at first, but after the first couple times we’d mastered it and it became a point of pride for us. His home was nice and cozy, with nice architectural details like stained glass windows and a lovely fireplace. We specifically loved using the espresso machine every morning as a special vacation treat. Karl was also nice enough to loan us his bikes, which made getting around cheap and way more fun than being stuck underground on a nice day. We feel like we saw so much because we were able to get around this way! If two wheels aren’t for you, the city is very walkable and his home is just a short walk from the train station. Overall, Karl was friendly and communicative, even recommending bike routes for us to take. We would be happy to stay at his home again! ","9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0

"Alex’s place is in a fabulous location. Tons of shops and restaurants very close by. The subway is only a 7 min walk away. The place was very clean and tidy and looks just like the pictures. Alex was very friendly and offered us tips about some great places to check out. It does get quite hot in the apartment since there is no air conditioning. The room gets direct sun for most of the day and the curtains are quite sheer. There was a table fan in the bedroom that helped a bit but we didn’t sleep well. The bed was smaller than I expected. It looked like a queen in the photos but it was a double so its a bit snug for 2 people if you are used to stretching out when sleeping.  It sits on a large piece of wood on the frame instead of a box spring, so it creaks loudly anytime someone moves. We also found the pillows to be very thin. Overall though for the price  it was a good deal. If you are looking for a budget place to stay I would recommend staying here as you can’t beat the location! ","10,0",3,1,10.0,0.0
"When I first saw the location and price, I thought this sounds too good to be true. But it IS true! The location is in the middle of everything picturesque - cobblestone streets right when you step out, Old Port and Old Montreal your neighborhood, around the corner from City Hall and numerous restaurants with scenic patios. You can cross the street to Bonsecours Market, or walk 5 minutes to Notre Dame Bonsecours Chapel and about 10 to Notre Dame Basilica. If you want more than what's immediately walkable, Champs de Mars station is very close. If you drove like we did, there is paid street parking around you for short term stays, and many lots to choose from for overnight stays. We personally liked the indoor garage on Gosford and Champs de Mars streets.

As for the loft itself, it has beautiful views of Old Port and Old Montreal, as well as a comfortable mattress and futon. It is well kept, and Yanick will provide you with wifi, a refrigerator full of cold water bottles, along with towels and linens. The pictures are exactly how the loft looks. He will also respond to any messages within a couple of days prior to your arrival, and within an hour or so during your stay. Logistics very easy for check in and check out.","10,0",2,1,10.0,0.0

Basement of the building is under renovation - so it is a little messy when you enter the building but obviously not the guys' fault. Bathroom a little dated but again perfectly functional.

Couple of little issues with heating and tv reception, both of which i suspect are because of the renovation to the building. I daresay these will be resolved quickly and won't cause any future guests any probs at all - and i would certainly recommend the place to other travellers!","9,0",2,0,10.0,-1.0

The apartment was just as described, wonderfully clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Plenty of power outlets to charge my many camera batteries as well. While we didn't use it I loved that the kitchen was well supplied with all pots and pans you might need to cook yourself a nice dinner to eat on their lovely back porch. It's located within walking distance of many outstanding restaurants, Olympic Park, and the Metro for easy access to downtown Montreal. Easy parking on the street right outside as well! I'm already looking at my calendar to figure out when we can come back!","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0
"The apartment was as depicted in the ad. It was clean, comfortable, bright, colorful, and really seemed to impart a sense of the host (whom we did not meet this trip, but I spoke with on the telephone). The arrival arrangements were as promised, even though we were later than anticipated. Having a washer and dryer in the apartment was great. The weather was hot and humid but there was a rotating fan in the apartment that helped a great deal in that regard. We felt comfortable while there and were able to enjoy coffee on the terrace in the mornings (at least when it wasn't raining =)

The neighborhood was as described by other reviewers -- quiet, residential, diverse. A short walk to Jarry street presented a side array of options for dining, coffee, and drinks. There were several Vietnamese restaurants, Greek, Italian, and a couple of bars. We returned again and again to EtOH, which was on Jarry and St-Denis, as they had twenty craft beers on tap and good pub food. Java Mythe, which was marked in a Traveller's Guide Anouchka has put together and placed in the apartment, had excellent coffee. A bit of a walk first thing in the morning, but worth it. A walk to Parc Jarry turned up a free concert Friday evening; and over on Villeray we were able to get our poutine fix at Frites Alors. The subway, also on Jarry, was a short walk, and between that, our feet, and the 193 and 30 buses, we were able to go anywhere we wanted without having to touch the car for five days. Downtown, the Old City, the Plateau and Parc Mont-Royal, the waterfront and Atwater Market -- for the most part, were within half an hour without needed the car. We would not hesitate to return to Anouchka's apartment.","10,0",3,1,10.0,0.0

"What an awesome place to stay in Montreal.  So close to Laurier metro station, this bnb is the perfect way to simulate how the locals live in this beautiful city.  Jen was a great host, she pops in everyday to make sure everything is ok in the house and you'll hopefully get to meet some fantastic guests as I did.  If I ever go back to Montreal I will definitely stay her as you feel like you're living in someone's house and the owner isn't home :)

If you are a light sleeper I would strongly recommend asking for the back bedroom or the one in the middle (it doesn't have any windows so if you're a fresh air freak that might be something to take into consideration).  I had the large room at the front and it was massive; I sleep with ear plugs and a couple of nights the traffic kept me awake, but overall I loved staying here 100%.

Direction from the metro - when you get off the tube (if heading north on Montmorency direction) go towards the exit that doesn't have stairs visible.  There'll be an escalator and then a flight of stairs and exit at the Gilford doors.  As you look right this is the bus stop, I think they terminate here and it looks like a dead end street.  There's a street that veers off to the left and at the end there's some traffic lights (you'll walk past some restaurants on the left, a pizza joint on the corner on the right), when you're standing next to the pizza place, cross over the road (across the 4 lanes, not the crossing that flows with the traffic) and the door is basically right there in front of the lights.  There's no sign indicating the name of the bnb, just keep an eye out for the door as it's a bit hard to see at first.  It's in between the shops and I walked past it the first time.","9,0",3,0,10.0,-1.0

"We had a fantastic stay here. The location is amazing, half a block from a metro station and a street with lots of restaurants, bars, shops. It's a lively area yet nice and quiet in the apartment.

The place itself was spotless when we arrived, and the bed was very comfortable.

Self-check-in was easily done with keys in a lockbox, and the host was easily available by phone/text throughout our stay. We're only sorry we didn't get to meet him.

Highly recommended!","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0

"Overall this was an ok experience, and the host was away but really attentive. But - the apartment's condition didn't meet our expectations based on the pictures & price point (we would say it was ""fairly pricy"" - not super cheap, but not super expensive based on other listings we looked at). Would definitely stay again at a cheaper price, or if it was more polished. More details: There were multiple nights when the neighbours were loud until very late - 2am, 3am. Though the kitchen has plates, some spices, some dishes (enough to cook ok), it was not easy to cook in because there was no light & no small spoons and some other small items were missing. The bathroom was clean, but pretty rickety. There was only men's soap & no shampoo (though we were told there would be toiletries). The AC was only available in the bedroom, so it got pretty hot in the kitchen sometimes. The good: great location, clean, really attentive host, pretty spacious, and had great amenities (washer, dryer, etc). Overall I think this listing would be worth the 'fairly pricy' price if things were more polished around the house - it has a great location, great vibe, a great host, and is pretty spacious.","9,0",2,1,10.0,-1.0

"Our place was tidy and cozy. There was everything a traveler would need, including all the utilities needed to cook and clean with, as well as extra towels and bathroom amenities. Our neighbors upstairs were a little noisy (you can hear their footsteps), as they had a small child or perhaps several who would run around in the mornings as well as late in the night. When their doorbell rings, the lights inside the apartment will flash, and an alarm will sound. It is in a basement, but the location is fantastic. There was a nice park across the street, and it was only a few hundred meters from the subway, which will take you into the city in less than a half hour. Unfortunately, we did lose our key, and had to pay the most expensive option to regulate the situation. If this happens to you, purchase a Weiser SmartKey Relocking set at Walmart or Home Depot, a few kilometers away from the apartment for $15 to re-key it yourself, as the lock is a Weiser Smartkey lock, which does not need to be replaced to be re-keyed. With that said, be advised that since there is no security deposit, any potential damages will have to be discussed between you and your host. Other than losing our key and having to replace an entire lock rather than getting a new set of keys, we had a great time in Montreal and enjoyed our stay in Steven's lodging.","9,0",1,0,9.0,0.0

"I selected this apartment for location and value, and I was quite pleased. From this location we didn't even use the car. We just rode our bicycles everywhere. The bike trail is not far, and it took us to Old Montreal and beyond. The second bed in the apartment is a pull-out couch, which was comfortable enough for our short stay. We were there during a heat wave, and we noticed with the bedroom door closed the bedroom was stuffy, but that was solved the next night by leaving the door open. I opted to park curbside and received a parking fine, not realizing it was illegal there. Next time I would pay to park in the garage.

"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Ben's place. The location is great and it was one of the more budget-friendly options. The reviews were so good I think our expectations were a little too high. In retrospect, we should have known there would be some compromises. The building is not so nice once you get past the lobby. The elevators and hallways often smelled of cigarettes and generally didn't seem very clean. The apartment itself was dark and had a slightly musty smell. It was clean except for some crumbs on the floor and couch, and the bedding which didn't look like it had been washed. We asked for it to be replaced, though, and Ben took care of it quickly while we were out for dinner. Ultimately, the apartment didn't get in the way of enjoying the city and we had a little extra money left over to spend elsewhere.","9,0",2,0,10.0,-1.0

The only issue for us was parking, which is a nightmare like everywhere else in Montreal. We wound up getting a $63 ticket because we didn't check enough of the signs on the street. Even the police seemed confused about the parking regulations. Be forewarned. ","9,0",3,0,10.0,-1.0
"My husband and I stayed here last weekend and loved it. It's right in the heart of old Montreal which is perfect for midnight strolls. The place was exactly what it was advertised and it was very clean- which is the most important thing to me being a clean freak. Frederick and Kloe were very responsive and accommodating and if we go back to Montreal I would definitely stay there again. Checking in was easy. We actually stayed in for dinner one night and the place has all the basic appliances, cutlery, etc that worked out nicely. It was also surprisingly quiet on the street side as I was nervous the roaming of the cars would keep me up all night. I imagine there are a few airbnb units in that building so once in a while you do hear loud and inconsiderate guests yelling in the corridors.   But it's not that often.  If there was one thing I could change is the size of the bed as I'm used to larger beds but that is just me being picky. :)","10,0",3,1,10.0,0.0

"Barbara was very easy to communicate with and quick with her responses. Upon check-in we had difficulty with the key, as it was getting stuck and wouldn’t open the lock to the front door. (We also got confused as to which door was for her apartment - it’s the middle one.) Barbara had already left at this point for her own trip, but she came back, got us in and settled and provided a different key that worked better with the lock. 
My friend and I visited Montreal on a weekend where they were experiencing a heat wave, so not having air conditioning was a bit of a bummer. But the place has two balconies, one in the front and one in the back, so we opened the doors and had fresh air coming in through the apartment which was nice. 
Barbara has done a great job in decorating the place. She’s an artist so it makes sense. It’s definitely a cute and stylish spot and friend I left with inspiration as to how we may want to decorate our own places! :)

Thomas (Nicky's assistant) was available at all times and gave us a lot of recommendations for places to go. But, that's not all... They are the managers at Thursday's and suggested we should go there for dinner, drinks, and dancing. Little did we know that free shots were included (and really good ones, actually)! And Thomas is so energetic and nice that he made us feel super comfortable with our stay and definitely made an impression of how awesome Montreal and it's people are. The apartment was spotless and gorgeous, although we didn't spend much time in the apartment because we were too busy exploring Montreal because of the apartments fantastic location. It is about 15 minutes walking distance to all the restaurants, bars and shops, and the subway is about 5 minutes walking distance as well.

"We booked a flatbook apartment a month before our trip to Montreal. We chose that specific apartment because it has four separate bedrooms for the four of us and because of the proximity to the McGill university. The problem was that there was not hot water in the shower!!! In the Canadian weather of -2 to 10 degrees it did not make any sense to us. We asked for it to be repaired and although they tried it did not change at all. We were offered to move to different apartment but the apartments that were offered were not as close to the university and had only 3 bedrooms. We do want to mention that in all other aspects the apartment was great and flatbook also helped us get a big taxi to go the the airport. But at last we had a week of cold showers which made a really bad experience to us overall. When we book an apartment that is a basic thing that we expect.

The neighborhood is safe and beautiful with easy transportation anywhere in the city. Metro Outremont is 5min away, and this apartment is off the main street, but 2mins away from major bus stops. It's also walking/biking distance to Bernard Street, and to the Mile End, where there are many restaurants, bars and coffee shops.

For future users, Zoe has recently renovated the dining and kitchen space, and it's so much more modern, open, and beautiful than the old photos still up. Our 2.5yr old son loved playing in this newly renovated space.

"This was our first time using airbnb - and Collin and Mel ensured that it will be the first of many! Collin was very prompt with messages even before we booked. When we got in, both him and lovely Mel was there to check us in. They are such warm and wonderful people - they helped us with our bags (even though they didn't have to!), gave us so many incredible local tips (Collin is a chef, both he and Mel love cooking, so these guys know the real deal when it comes to food) and let us use their kitchen to make chai and generously told us we could use their Nespresso coffees and teas. The photos of the room and space on airbnb are accurate - it's nice and cozy, faces a relatively quiet street so you have peace at night, but best of all, it's in a fantastic neighborhood. We loved that it's close to the metro, steps away from one of the best bakeries and excellent restaurants...just a fabulous way to soak Montreal in.

This being our first time, my husband was super nervous about ""staying in someone's home."" But it really felt so much more personal than being in a hotel, especially with their gorgeous ""cloud-like"" cat Chippie! We walked away making friends, these are people we'd love to spend time with over drinks (and we did!). Couldn't have asked for more. Thank you Mel and Collin, you guys made our stay in Montreal super special.","9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0
"After living in Montreal for 3 years, I spent my last 4 months at Laura's place and I could have not  hoped for a better way to enjoy this ending experience in Quebec. Laura made me feel home since day one. Living with her made my days happier and funnier, she's caring, full of energy, curious and interesting. She's very open minded and used to meeting different people all the time. There's no way you could be bored having her around. 
If you're only visiting for a few days, she will definitely be a good adviser, she knows her city by heart. If you're staying longer like I did, the only risk is that you might have a heavy heart when it will be time to leave.

"Excellent Airbnb experience! The room was cozy and very pleasant. Tessa welcomed us and provided toiletries, towels, and a very helpful list of restaurants in the area.  Mile End is a great location, and is convenient (15 min walk) to the metro.  And the cat is very friendly!","10,0",3,1,10.0,0.0

"Zhen et sa famille sont des personnes très accueillantes du début jusqu'à la fin, leur maison est vraiment très bien placée ,tout près d'un arrêt de bus et à 10 minutes à pied du métro Snowdon ! La chambre est très spacieuse ainsi que la salle de bain et le lit est vraiment confortable .Il y a beaucoup de magasins dans les environs et il est donc très facile de s'approvisionner ou juste sortir manger dehors .Zhen et sa femme son des personnes vraiment adorable qui sont très attentionnés et attentifs à vos besoins ,ils cuisinent très bien tous les deux (Website hidden by Airbnb) dois avouer que j'étais un peu triste de partir tellement c'était agréable de vivre la bas!","10,0",2,1,10.0,0.0
We had a great overnight stay here. The location is perfect and Maria had left us with everything we would need for a comfortable stay.  She was very quick to respond when we had a question about parking. We would love to stay at Maria's again next time we're in Montreal :),"9,0",4,1,10.0,-1.0

"Magali was an awesome host. She gave great tips on restaurants and events that were happening all around the city. She really went above and beyond even tailoring additional info for the event we were in town for (Formula One Race). The check-in was super easy and she was quick to respond during our visit. She also gave accurate and thorough information about the space and its amenities. 

The space was comfortable and exactly what we needed since we were spending most of our days out in the city. Her garden in the back is very charming and so is the space. It feels like spending time in a friend's home. We will absolutely be back next time we are in Montreal. 

The location also can not be beaten. Everything you need is a walk away and the train is a half block away making it a great starting point for visiting everywhere in Montreal. The area is very hip reminded us a lot of our neighborhood in Brooklyn. Bars, great food, and cafes. ","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0

"Lovely, cosy and quiet loft in old Montreal-was just as described. There were beautiful views and a homey atmosphere. Yanick is a superb host. He was quick and spot on with answers to all my questions and has an extremely welcoming manner. He waited there to greet me despite a fairly late arrival and as other guests have mentioned went the extra mile supplying fruit, milk and breakfast food for the stay. Loved the loft!","10,0",4,1,10.0,0.0
