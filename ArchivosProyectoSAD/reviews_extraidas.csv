"my stay in the comfy private double room was indeed comfy!   it´s not just conveniently in the middle of a great neighborhood, walkig distance from the mont royal and a bunch of nice cafes and bars but the hosts were very easy going, helpful and fun. i´d totally do it again!

"An amazing and enormous room and a total bargain at the price. Nice backyard. Great neighbourhood. Friendly and accommodating host. I hereby have nothing bad to say!","10"
"I had a FABULOUS stay! The room was enormous and just as pictured. You really cannot beat the neighborhood - walking distance to a ton of great local bars/restaurants/parks and easy access to the bus and the subway. The hosts were so gracious and helpful. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.","10"
"We had a wonderful stay! The host was very friendly and helpful, the room was exactly like the picture, and the location was perfect. ","10"

"L'accueil proposé par Laura et Lulu est chaleureux et très agréable. Le quartier est un des meilleurs de Montréal et l'appartement est idéalement située. La chambre est très grande et calme. 
Laura est une hôte remarquable, et très arrangeante ! Merci encore pour ce premier séjour a Montréal ! ","10"
"J'ai passé 5 jours chez Laura, l'appartement est grand et ressemble bien a ce que l'on peut voir sur les photos. La chambre est elle aussi très grande, et le lit très confortable. 
Pour ce qui est de Laura et de Anne, elles sont toutes les deux très sympas et mettent à l'aise tout de suite. En bref on se sent comme chez soit. 
Au final, un super début de séjour à Montréal, encore merci à Laura et Anne. ","10"
"If I had to describe my stay at Laura's in one word it would be 'AMAZING'! Luckily, I have more space. 

The room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). 

I've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. 

The neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer. Despite all this the street is actually really quiet and is very safe!

"Laura was a brilliant host. The key pick up was well-organized and I felt immediately welcomed into the home. Essentials/amenities were provided for which made it much easier.

She also gave us great advice on where to go and eat. Overall Laura was just an awesome host.
","10"
"I stayed here for a week during one of the many festivals in Montreal. Communication before arrival was great and when I checked in there was a lovely hand written welcome letter with instructions as the host was at work.

The room was as pictured in the listing, clean and bright and the double bed was super comfy ( i slept really well). Location was also great right next to St.Laurent with cafes and restaurants near by and a large supermarket. 

Laura and her housemates made me feel super welcome in their home and would stay here again.","10"
"Super cute apartment, with a great room! Laura was super welcoming and made my stay very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this place! I had a great time!","10"
"Our stay with Laura was wonderful! The room was clean and homey and the location was very central and interesting. Lilou was great at communicating with us about arrival and departure and very friendly - providing us with some tips about what to do in the city. She really went above and beyond to accommodate us... I'd definitely recommend staying here!","10"
"Laura was awesome to stay with! Her place is in the BEST location, in the artistic area of Montrèal, very close to a bus station, grocery store, coffee shops, music bars and very good restaurants. The bedroom was so beautiful, clean, cosy and comfortable! I went to Montrèal on my own and I couldn't choose a better flat/area in the city. As a woman you can walk wherver you want feeling so confident and safe!!! 

The whole apartment is so clean and beautiful! I got there just in time for good weather, and Laura was so nice to me, ready to answer to any question of myne, every time I needed, by phone and in person. We also had a lovely chat together in her fantastic courtyard and she invited me to her tasty birthday party introducing me all her friends. She has been great to me!
If you want to go to Montrèal, you absolutely have to go in her place!

"The room was spacious and clean. Lucy was very welcoming and great to have a chat with! Our stay was only 3 days so Lucy suggested some great places to eat and things to do. Close to some great places to eat and shops.","10"
"Laura est une hôte très chaleureuse, accueillante et communicative.
Le logement est dans un quartier très agréable, la chambre est spacieuse et conforme aux photos. 
Son chat Lulu est mignon tout plein et très calme. 
Nous recommandons fortement après les deux belles journées passées à Montréal.","10"
"Such a lovely space and host! Arrival was very easy, and the apartment and room I was staying in (the front room) were clean and well decorated. The backyard was an great place to chill out - very relaxing and private. 

The host, Laura, was very friendly and laid-back. The resident kitty was possibly even more friendly than Laura, and will monopolize your whole stay with her adorableness if you let her. 

The area is very close to bus routes, as well as some small coffee shops and restaurants, and of course the beautiful Mont Royale. The Mile-End neighborhood is eclectic and cute, with lots to see even if you're just wandering. 

I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to friends headed to Montreal. ","10"
"Fantastic experience. Laura was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The room was comfortable and everything we needed for our week in Montreal. It was perfectly located to easily get anywhere we wanted to go into the city easily. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again next time I come to Montreal.","10"
"I loved the neighbourhood - pretty houses and cool cafes and lots of young people on bikes. I really appreciate the simple but tasteful way that Laura has furnished her house. 
Laura is super warm and lovely, helpful, kind and also gives you space you need. 

The bed is very comfortable with lovely fluffy pillows. The room is really big and lovely.

I just can't fault this accommodation. It's a fabulous inexpensive option. ","10"
"Le logement correspond totalement au descriptif , avec une chambre spacieuse . L'emplacement est idéal avec restaurants , boutiques et épiceries à 5 minutes à pieds .Laura est très sympathique et souriante  ; mais malheureusement elle n'a pas pu être très présente lors de mon séjour . Juste vue en coup de vent 4 ou 5 fois . Le chat Lulu est un vieux pépère adorable . Pour mon premier airbnb cela à été très positif , avec en plus d'avoir eu une colocataire française adorable pendant mon séjour  .

"Lovely room, great area, fantastic host!","10"
"After living in Montreal for 3 years, I spent my last 4 months at Laura's place and I could have not  hoped for a better way to enjoy this ending experience in Quebec. Laura made me feel home since day one. Living with her made my days happier and funnier, she's caring, full of energy, curious and interesting. She's very open minded and used to meeting different people all the time. There's no way you could be bored having her around. 
If you're only visiting for a few days, she will definitely be a good adviser, she knows her city by heart. If you're staying longer like I did, the only risk is that you might have a heavy heart when it will be time to leave. 
","10"
"The place was amazing and was located in a nice neighbourhood full of cool vintage stores, restaurants and bars. Laura was super nice and friendly. She made me feel so welcome and my room was clean, also the bed was comfy. Everything was just so great! I would definitely stay at Laura's again for my next trip to Montréal! :)","10"
"Hôtesse charmante et serviable, grande chambre confortable et bien située.
Un vrai nid douillet!","10"
"I stayed at Laura's place for 3 weeks and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Montréal! Laura was a fantastic host, so lovely and helpful, making sure my arrival was easy even though she was at work. The room was as pictured and very spacious, with plenty of space for luggage and a super comfy bed. The entire apartment is clean and spacious, and it was great having access to a washer and dryer. The apartment is in a safe neighbourhood, located within a couple of minutes walking distance of the bustling Blvd St-Laurent. There are so many great restaurants, cafés and shops nearby (including a large supermarket a few minutes away) you are spoiled for choice. Mont-Royal metro station is only a 10 minute walk away to so you can be downtown in 25 minutes! ","10"
"Tout d'abord la chambre est conforme aux photos et l'appartement est très bien situé au cœur du Plateau. Il se situe entre le métro Mont-Royal et Laurier sans parler des nombreux bus à proximité qui vous emmèneront directement en centre-ville. 
Laura est vraiment une super hôte, vous pouvez réserver les yeux fermés!","10"
"Je me suis senti très bien accueilli par Lilou et ses adorables chat et chatons. Lilou a su avec beaucoup de respect et sociabilité, préserver mon intimité dont j'avais besoin à ce moment là. 
De plus, j'ai beaucoup apprécié son appartement qui est propre, très calme et très bien situé. La chambre étant grande et justement aménagée . Je recommande vivement cette place :-)","10"
"Great location, very comfortable room, very friendly hosts. ","10"
"Laura was absolutely the best. Check-in instructions were clear and the place was absolutely fantastic. The place was exactly the right spot for shopping and cool cafés to check out in the morning, as well as lunch and supper locales in the evenings. Literally one block from a bus that took me straight downtown if I didn't want to walk, which, when I wanted to, was straight down Boul. St. Laurent! The room was big and clean and quiet. I would have loved to stay longer!","10"
"My stay at Laura's place was amazing! The house is spacious, clean, and cosy, and nestled in the heart of the lively, funky, and beautiful Plateau-Mont-Royal. Laura has an amazing way of making her place feel relaxed and friendly, and her guests feel welcome! Merci Laura, this was one of my best Airbnb experiences yet :) ","10"
"La chambre , la hôte et l emplacement sont magnifiques !
Et les chats aussi !

"A lovely spacious room with the convenience of cooking facilities and close to excellent restaurants and a Bixi bike stop.","10"
"My stay was wonderful, it was a great start and place to explore Montreal. I was made to feel right at home!","10"
"I loved staying at Laura's apartment! Her place is spacious and clean and she is super friendly and easy to coordinate with. I was arriving earlier than the check-in time and Laura made arrangements so that I could come in earlier and leave my bags in the room. The location of her place is ideal, surrounded by stores, cafes and restaurants and walking distance from other cool neighborhoods. There is close access to public transportation (metro and bus) and I was able to get to all the areas I wanted to visit very easily. The room is huge with a comfy bed, closet space, a big desk and a corner sofa. The rest of the apartment was clean and orderly and I felt really comfortable throughout my stay. I would definitely recommend staying at Laura's and I will certainly do so whenever I visit Montreal again!","10"
"airbnb au top! Laura est super cool, la chambre est grande, pratique il y a tout ce qu'il faut. L'emplacement est génial à une rue de Saint Laurent, 5min des transports en commun...  Allez-y sans hésiter","10"
"Lilou's place is situated in a very lively neighborhood and not far away from downtown (10min by bus and 30 min walking). She is a very hospitable host and I felt at home during my 2 weeks stay. Milton (the cat) is super friendly but not annoying. Try to visit few of her local restaurants' recommendations, there are some great tips. Overall, this is one of the best airbnb accommodations in Mtl.","10"

3. 편의시설

- 부엌. 냉장고 사용 가능

4. 결론
엄청 친근한 호스트 덕에 잘 쉬다 감. 
집이 무지 예뻐서 그냥 보기만 해도 기분 좋아짐. 
여름-가을에 가면 몽로얄도 가깝고, 뒷마당도 있어서 더 좋을 것 같음. 
다운타운에서 가깝진 않지만, 몬트리올은 작고 대중교통이 잘 되어 있어서 이동이 불편하지 않음. 오히려 동네가 조용하고 근처에 쉴 수 있는 카페가 많아서 좋았음.

"Mi sono fermata tre settimane a casa di Lilou e mi sono sentita subito a casa.La casa è molto accogliente oltre a essere bella e funzionale. Lilou ha senza dubbio stile. La casa è posizionta tra i miei due quartieri in assoluto preferiti della città: Plateu e Mile End e bastano pochissimi giorni per sentirsi subito integrati nel quartiere come un vero Montrealese!! Meno di 10 minuti a piedi e si raggiunge la stazione della metropolitana Laurier e in meno di 15 minuti quella di Mont-Royal. Inoltre l'autobus 55 passa a un minuto a piedi da casa e ti porta in Downtown - old port in 20 minuti e in little italy in 15. Il quartiere è pieno di cafè, gallerie d'arte, negozi vintage e bistro dove cenare o fare un brunch! E' davvero un luogo autentico.
Lilou è un host fantastica.. e la sua gatta Milton è molto dolce e simpatica.
La casa ha tutto ciò che (Website hidden by Airbnb) cucina è ben fornita e in taverna c'è la lavatrice e l'asciugatrice che si può utilizzare liberamente.","10"
"The location of Lilou's place in the heart of the Plateau couldn't be better: really good restaurants just a block away (try Robin Du Bois!), a superb massage and bodywork business just around the corner (Place Nomade), a few blocks to the supermarket in one direction, a few more blocks to the natural food store in another direction, great ethnic restaurants in every direction, even an excellent hardware store in walking distance, not to mention big public parks (especially Mont Royal), about a 15-minute walk to the Laurier metro stop, Portuguese, Greek and Hassidic communities nearby, trendy bars, vintage bagel shops...etc., etc. A very fun area to be in. To stay in this airbnb, you definitely need to be OK with cats, since the very friendly black cat who lives there considers herself the true owner. The bed was excellent, the kitchen very practical, the laundry machines in the basement easy to use, and Lilou herself is very friendly and welcoming and helpful.","10"
"I spent a perfect 7 nights at Laura’s. The location was awesome, as it was one street off of St. Laurent (a street with many neat shops and restos) and a 10 minute walk to the metro. It was also a short walk to the Mile End where the delicious bagels are. Although it was crazy hot outside, the apartment and bedroom were still very cool. The bedroom was large and the bed was super comfy. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!","10"
"This was a great neighborhood and a beautiful, big, quiet space. Can’t recommend it enough for anyone who wants to enjoy Le Plateau and have a refuge to rest and relax at night.","10"
"I absolutely loved staying here. Laura is super friendly and helpful, her apartment is somewhere you'd want to hang out in your real life, and the neighborhood is very walkable and has lots of interesting restaurants, parks, and shops. ","10"
"One of the most wonderful hosts I've had the chance to meet through Airbnb. I wasn't there for very many days, but the room was very spacious and I was very thankful for the laundry facilities! I even lost my purse with the house key and the host was super nice about it. The location is fantastic and I would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Montreal!","10"

"What a gem. Although I’m not highly familiar with Montreal and its various neighborhoods, this wonderful home is close to everything I wanted/needed. Super hip neighborhood, a beautiful park not too far away and so many lovely shops/cafes, if that’s what you’re into. There was a grocery store across the street and lots of bus stops nearby. The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It’s ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn’t make my stay any less incredible. The price is right and I cannot recommend this place enough! ","10"
"Merci Lilou!
I spent super nice days at Lilou's home. The room is big, bright and super comfortable. The house is big, has a super nice backyard and is very well located!

The Metro is only a 10 Minute walk away and lots of bus stops are nearby. If you like, you can easily walk to the city center or visit sights like the Mont-Royal. Laura is a very great host: super friendly and caring. She made it really easy for me to settle in Montreal and very fast it felt a bit like home :) The room is very nice and bigger than I have expected!

"Teodora was a great host! She contacted me before we arrived to prepare us for the checking in process. She was very accommodating our rushed arrival (we had dinner res.!) and had a great printout regarding any questions we might have about her home. 

We really enjoyed her cat Tsitsou. I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. 

The location is great. It's less than a 10 min walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!

One suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed, to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. 

I will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!","10"

"Everything was very smooth, as accurate as the pictures. Antoine was available to answer questions before we arrive to Montreal. The apartment was comfortable, great location ( full of restaurants, shops, etc.) and had all items to make you feel like home, the free coffee was an extra touch","9"
"Very easy to get to, and in a great location. Antoine was a great host, making sure we had everything we needed even though he wasn't in town. When the air conditioner stopped working, a replacement was promptly brought in. The apartment itself was very clean when we arrived.","9"
"The apartment is very well situated. Close to many restaurants, bars, Mont Royal, cafes and pharma prix . Antoine was a lovely and accommodating host, I would certainly recommend him. He responded to messages quickly, was very flexible with check out times and the place is very accurately described in the listing. Thank you Antoine!","9"
"Every was good and match the description! Antoine was super accommodating.","9"
"Wonderful spot in an awesome area. Lots to do. Antoine was very accomodating and always tthere to answer questions.  Clean spot. Stored out luggage for us the day we checked out until we had to go to the airport.","9"
"It was great staying at Antoine's place for the week we were there. The location is good -- a bit far from the metro system, but we happened to stay during the week of Mural making it a really busy and exciting street to stay on. The space itself was decent with three rooms, one bath, and a kitchen. There is no sofa and the air conditioning was limited to the heat pump in the kitchen, but overall a great bang for your buck and a pleasant stay. Antoine was very pleasant, responsive, helpful, and accommodating. ","9"
"Spent 4 days at Antoine's place and it was great! Close to some really good restaurants such as Schwartz, Romados, and patati patata. Antoine was great with keeping the lines of communication open. the only that's really missing is a couch in the common area.","9"
"Great location! Right in the heart of the action and close to everything else. The apt was a good size, nice and clean, with everything we needed. Antoine was very fast to reply to any questions I had about the booking. Very happy with this spot and would definitely recommend staying here.","9"
"Our stay was fantastic. The location was absolutely perfect with everything being a short walk away. The appartment was clean and was quite spacious for our group of 5. The neighbourhood is just wonderful and we would definately come back again.","9"
"Good stay at Antoine's place. The apartment is very well located close to a lot of the best restaurants and bars in Montreal and walking distance to many sights. Perfect place and well priced for those who need 3 bedrooms and plan to mostly use the apartment for sleeping. As stated in the description, there isn't a living room but there is a large tv and table with chairs in the kitchen area. Air conditioning only in the kitchen but will partially cool bedrooms if you leave all doors open (there are fans in each room, two rooms have windows that open, one just a skylight). Antoine is very helpful, we needed a parking spot for the weekend and he let us take the one he was in (free Friday-Sunday). ","9"
"Place was exactly like the photos.  Location was very convenient.  The most important thing for my family and I was that the apartment was clean.  I didn't meet Antoine but he left a detail message of how to get into the apartment.  A very good first experience with Airbnb.

Bonus: Netflix was available","9"
"Perfect neighborhood and easy to get around from there using subways/cabs. Also had a lockbox for the keys which made it really easy for us to get in and out when we weren't together. By a ton of restaurants and shops, can't really go wrong. Prompt communication and he was normally in the area if we had real pressing issues.","9"
"Very good location and a was cozy apt. In the very surprising hot days at Montreal the aircon at the kitchen was not sufficient to cool the whole apt. Antoine was a very good host quickly helping on any issue. I'd surely recommend. Don't miss the all-you-can-eat No1 Sushi close by...","9"
"It's not exactly luxurious, but that's OK. The beds were fine, the WiFi was good, and the location is perfect. The front door opens right out onto St. Laurent, and you can walk to Schwartz's and all kinds of bars in minutes. The only strange thing to note is that the toilet is oddly close to an angled wall, so you can't really sit with your legs straight. All in all, if you're just looking for somewhere to come back and crash after a night of drinking, this place fits the bill.","9"
"Antoine is a good communicator, and will address your questions. Convenient location and 2 decent sized rooms, the 3rd is a bit squished and lacks natural light. The air conditioner in the kitchen works well and if you leave the bedroom doors open it helps a lot for hot nights. Fine for a short stay and if you are there to only tour the town, but no sofa or anything to chill out on. ","9"
"Great location in the bustling heart of the Plateau. Three bedroom set-up very convenient. Blvd Saint-Laurent vibrant and full of bars and restaurant that are especially lively on weekend. Perfect communication with Antoine","9"
"Great location. The lockbox containing the keys were very helpful for our large group. The apartment was clean and tidy, basic, but exactly what we needed. 
","9"
"This apartment is very conveniently located - a five minute walk to the base of Mont-Royal, thirty-five minute stroll to the river, you'll be surrounded by shops and cafes of every sort, and the residents of Montreal struck me as pleasant, patient, and engaging.

Our host immediately responded to any question or request and could not have been more helpful.

The stairway is a bit of a chore to negotiate and there is a bar below that caters to enthusiastic sports fans so if the game goes late you can hear their responses to great plays and bad calls.

The kitchen area functions well, there is a good shower, and having a washer and dryer unit is great!

I personally find the gray paint in the stairway and the white walls of the all the rooms drab and boring, but that seems to be the norm for rental real estate. All in all the apartment served me well and our host was a charm.","9"
"Antoines place was lovely, very clean and cozy. 10 minute walk to the Plateau, so very close to shops and restaurants. We got comfortable quite quick, perfect for a small group of friends or multiple family members. My friends and I had a wonderful stay!","9"
"Great location, Pereira very flexible and accommodated us well on arrival, great spot to have a group","9"
"舒适的三居室,三个人出差,所以选了这家里工作地点比较近的公寓,离超市和各种餐厅也不远,位置极佳｡厨房用具,洗衣机和烘干机等各项设备很全,WiFi也很快,从出差角度来讲性价比很不错｡美中不足的是可能因为是老房子,地板稍微有些倾斜了,如果对这方面特别在意的话不建议预订,除此之外都很好,尤其是钥匙盒很方便,这样多人出行的时候大家可以单独行动｡","9"

"Antoine's apartment is the perfect place to stay if you are traveling in a larger group and looking to check out Montreal. It is very centrally located in the Plateau neighborhood and also very close to Parc du Mont Royal. I would 100% stay here again if traveling to Montreal.  It was exactly as advertised.","9"
"Very clean and great location - wonderful experience overall!","9"
"Great space","9"
"This is located right in the heart of st Laurent.  Amazing location..   Better than expected.  Easy access to everything you need.  Antoine was a great host.  Only downfall would be that the building and floor in the unit are not level and very uneven.  Be careful walking up the stairs!  Overall it was great.  I would definitely recommend and stay here again!","9"
"Great 3 bedrooms really well placed. Host was really responsive and answered to all our requests promptly.
I recommend this apartment and would come back with no hesitation!","9"
"Just as described! Clean and great location.","9"
"The location is great and within walking distance shops and restaurants. A large apartment, easily big enough for 6 adults. Kitchen could use a little upgrade and some comfortable seating in living area would also help. A great functional base for people who intend to be out exploring a lot, not so great for spending a night in.","9"
"A terrific place for seeing a lot of Montreal. Really close and accessible to Mont Royal for walks, close to tons of neat restaurants both on St. Laurent and surrounding neighbourhoods. Walkable to downtown or Vieux Montreal if your game, or there is a Bixi bike rental right behind. 

We stayed there with 3 kids and 2 adults and there was lots of space and the amenities were just what we needed. 

Just a heads up if you are mobility limited, it's two flights of stairs up and no elevator. Wasn't an issue for us but could be for others. ","9"
"This is a great value and it's accurate based on the description. The location is convenient and we received two sets of keys which made a huge difference. The appliances were a bonus as well as the balcony. Definitely enough space for 6 of us. Highly recommended!","9"
"Amazing location!  Has everything you need for a fun getaway w/ friends.","9"
"Nice little apartment. Approx 30 mins walk from Montreal centre. Lovely bars/restaurants nearby.","9"

"Nice flat in a trendy neighbourhood.","9"
"Great bang for your buck. Very close to great food spots. Easy check in and check out. Everything we needed in terms of essentials (shampoo, plates,forks, spoons, cups) all ready to be used. Great place, would be more than happy to come again.","9"
"There is a good location, but if you are with kids or elder people, sit on a 2nd floor with really small stairs. so if you have big/heavy luggage its difficult to climb","9"
"perfect as a home-base for exploring montreal. washer+dryer in the room was a huge bonus.","9"
"Great place for a weekend in Montreal.","9"
"Excellent location close to downtown Montreal!","9"
"Nice and convenient place! There are some restaurants and stores near the house.","9"
"Awesome location! I would highly recommend it!","9"
"Logement très bien situé. Par contre la cuisine n'était pas très propre. Il manquait une éponge. De plus les voisins de pallier étaient très bruyant.","9"
"Cet appartement est correct, il est bien situé dans Montréal.","9"
"What a fantastic spot! Bright and clean..... and close to everything. The kitchen was nicely stocked with everything you need to cool a meal. The beds were comfortable and even though the windows face the street you don’t hear a sound! Right in the middle of everything - great neighbourhood.  Lots of options for a late night Sunday dinner.... and great coffee shops too. Check in and out was very easy!","9"
"This place at Le Plateau is perfect. Close from bus and metro. Near from a supermarket, liquor store  and so many other stuff.  So walkable.  
Sparkling clean and really good space for 4 people. 
I would definitely book again!  And pretty soon I hope cuz I've really loved Montreal.","9"
"Great place in an awesome location!","9"
"Amazing location!!!! Comfy beds!! Fully stocked kitchen!! It was a very nice place. The only issue we faced was the floor was slanted, which really isn’t much of a problem but it caught us off guard. Other than that everything was perfect and exactly as described.","9"
"Antoine’s unit on St. Laurent Boulevard is perfect if you’re traveling with a friend, with two bedrooms and a nice little room with a sofa, as well as an Apple TV and a kitchen with a washer and dryer included. It also has a small balcony around back that faces adjacent units’ balconies.

Antoine ensured a clean apartment, and allowed us to not only check in very early but also allowed us to stay a little later than check out. His responses were prompt and courteous. A great room for exploring Montreal or just spending a week. Restaurants and bars are within minutes of walking, and the famous Schwartz smoked meat is just a block or so away. 

Overall great location, great host and a great price! What more could you ask for?","9"
"The place was perfect, and the location was a great suprise since we paid so little i didnt expect to be on such a bussiling road! Thanks so much to antoine for everything.","9"
"Very nice apartment with a lot of light and a little terrace. Great location but a lot of noise during the night. Antoine was answering very quickly and handled a problem with the back door very quickly too! There is no condiments, it is something to note before coming  We had a very nice stay!","9"
"L'appartement est très bien situé et à proximité de tout. Nous avons tout fait à pied toute la fin de semaine. Par contre, je conseille de vous apporter des bouchons pour dormir puisque les chambres sont du côté de la rue et la proximité des bars font en sorte qu'il y a beaucoup de bruits la nuit.
Sinon tout était parfait, je recommande cet appartement.","9"
"Great place, clean and comfortable. Quick responses from the host. And the location can't be beat! Perfect :) ","9"
"Il est inadmissible que ce logement soit sur le site AIRBNB !!!!","9"
"Great location! Host was very helpful with check-in! Amazing trip!","9"
"Was really good","9"
"Great, spacious apartment on top floor with lots of light and two decent-sized bedrooms. Lively location, perfect for exploring the mountain & Plateau on foot.","9"
"The apartment is simple and ok. But, we don’t like the location. Maybe it is good for young people, but not suitable for family. There is a busy street in front of the apartment, and many bars on the street open the entire night. You could hear a lot of noises from cars, people hanging out late in the bars. Hard to sleep all the night. The neighbors are most likely young people, keeping making noise and party until late night...","9"
"fantastic location, right next to great restaurants and vintage shops. easy to walk to just about everything. post was very responsive, and check in / check out was a breeze. the apartment itself is minimally furnished, but has all the essentials, which was more than adequate for us. the main living room area is well air-conditioned, unfortunately the bedrooms were not, leaving them feeling stuffy, especially when the doors are closed. each of the rooms did have a fan inside of them, but barely felt cool directly pointing the fan at us. one particular note that people should be aware of is having to walk up two flights of narrow stairs to get to the apartment. overall though, great value for the location.","9"
"Great location, near many restaurants and bars. Host was very helpful and responded quickly. Great job.","9"
"Great location.","9"
"Great location, lots going on around to check out. Very easy check-in, and the place was spacious and very clean.","9"
"The apartment is just as depicted in the photos and the description.  It was spotlessly clean.  I love the location right on St. Laurent Blvd.:  Convenient to restaurants, small grocery stores and the bus (#55) that runs to downtown.  Also, a taxi stand is less than half a block away, so getting back to the airport is no problem at all.  The host was super responsible and helpful.
Nota bene, any traveler with mobility issues:  The staircase to this third floor apartment is steep with very narrow steps, quite manageable for the healthy and agile among us...  However, if you are unsteady on your feet for any reason, consider one of Gestion88’s other offerings in the neighborhood.","9"
"The apartment was clean and well equipped. The location is awesome, near tons of bars and restaurants. Quite noisy at night as the windows face the very busy St-Laurent street.","9"
"Clean space on lovely Saint Laurent street. Wonderful location! Thanks for hosting us.","9"
"Propre, facile d’arriver. Pour les très grands, les pieds de lits peuvent gêner. L’air climatisé ne se rend pas vraiment aux chambres mais au moins la nôtre avait une fan. Éclairage intense et froid. Super emplacement du logement. Pensez à emmener un cache-yeux pour dormir si la lumière vous dérange car l’une des fenêtres est intérieure et donne sur les escaliers qui sont constamment éclairés.","9"
"Great location. Lots of great shops and restaurants. The street was pedestrian only during our stay! Great vibe. Plus, there is a secret bar close by...","9"
"Nice spot, good location, super clean.","9"
"The airbnb was clean, comfortable, affordable, and in a great location. Walkable to Old Montreal and very close to restaurants, shops, bars, etc. I would stay here again.","9"

"Stay here, I did and I loved it!","9"
"Great location and the check in was very easy. Apartment a little run down but no major problems. Would stay there again.","9"
"Great location, apt needs a few things like lamps in bedrooms, curtains and tv in a rm where it can be watched in comfort.  Pls add the sweep to the door so there is no gap to let cold air and mice in.","9"
"C'est bien et propre! L'emplacement est idéal pour faire des activités.","9"
"Nice place, have everything u need, good location..all very good","9"
"Amazing place and price for the location. Super cute set up with lots of room(kitchen, dining, living). It came with all the amenities you need. The host was really generous with letting us check in early and late when needed.","9"

Cet appartement dispose d'une belle et grande cuisine bien équipée, et de tout le nécessaire pour un séjour agréable.
Je recommande!","8"
"I had a lovely stay in Montreal. Titi's studio is cute, clean, cosy and warm. It is right by Place des Arts' tube station and it is close to a supermarket, shops, cafes, etc. The bus going to and from the airport stops just down the road, it is a 10 minutes straight walk. Titi was prompt to reply to my queries when booking the place and also remained available throughout my stay. Titi had left some space in the drawers so I could unpack and I had the fridge to put my week's supplies. It felt very homely. Wifi also worked very well. I will happily book  Titi's place again should I go back to Montreal. ","9"
"Our host was excellent and very accommodating.  She and a friend met us to let us in and give us the keys fairly late which was very much appreciated. The location is awesome, the decor super cute. Everything you need is here! Towels, wifi password, everything was easily accessible. Thanks so much! We will stay here again for sure. ","9"
"I had a great time in Montreal and it was compounded by this awesome corner unit apartment that was conveniently close to a lot of the main hubs of Montreal. It's 2 blocks away from the Metro and less than a mile walking distance from most places as well.  The apartment overall was very cozy, well heated during my winter stay and neighbors are very quiet. Would definitely recommend.","9"
"Excellent accueil, Titi est très arrangeant. Je me suis réellement sentie à la maison. Je recommande ! Et location excellente, plein de bons restaurants à proximité, on peut tout faire à pied, très proche du centre ville. In love !!!","9"
"Our experience was great. The apartment is small but very cozy and located in a great area. There were so many great places to grab a drink, eat, and even shop. Without a doubt, I would stay here again.","9"
"Titi was very welcoming and so incredibly helpful during my stay. Loved the place and location. I Would definitely stay there again.","9"
"Titi's apartment was just perfect for our weekend trip to Montreal! The location was fabulous, with amazing restaurants and 2 natural food stores within blocks, and downtown right there. Titi was so helpful! We needed to switch places, and with less than 24 hours notice she made it work for us to stay there. She was friendly and welcoming, and was timely with responses to our questions. Her place was inviting, bright and cozy. Everything was clean, parking tended to be pretty easy (although confusing in Montreal!), and the kitchen was stocked enough for us to cook up quick meals. The bed was a full sized futon-like bed, which was comfy yet pretty firm. Overall, a great place to stay! We will definitely be back. Thank you Titi!","9"
"The location is just perfect - in the center of EVERYTHING! The apartment is very cosy, charmingly decorated, and has a little balcony looking out to a beautiful street. Titi is very nice, responsive and helpful. Thank you so much Titi, I had a wonderful stay and would love to go back :)","9"
"Titi's apartment makes for a very genuine Airbnb experience. It was very nice to get to spend a couple of days in her environment. :)","9"
"Hôte sympathique et bel appartement, très bien situé. ","9"
"Titi was extremely nice, her apartment is beautiful! It is small, but perfect for a city trip, we walked to all major city attractions (about a 30 min walk to old Montreal) and it's a nice neighborhood. Titi was very approachable to us! ","9"
"We loved staying at Titi's. She was very understanding about us arriving later than expected, and when we did arrive she even came out to help us find a parking spot. Her apartment is clean, beautifully decorated, and has everything you need for an enjoyable stay. The location of the neighborhood is perfect. It is quaint and residential but very close to everything you need. Just a few short blocks to the metro gives you acces to the full city. Also within walking distance is the park and shopping streets like Saint Laurant. Titi was available for anything that we needed, and always responded promptly. Thank you, Titi, for the wonderful hospitality! We would love to stay again in the future. ","9"
"Wonderful location and comfortable place for our visit to Montreal! So easy to walk wherever you need to go from this place. Great balcony and relaxing apartment. Highly recommend!","9"
"The experience was very comfortable and Titi's little apartment is cozy with bright, welcoming colours. The place is basically a 5 minute walk from downtown, and parking was not too difficult to find either. We had access to wifi and the tv monitor which I easily connected to my computer with an HDMI. Titi was always there, a call away, if we had any questions. Although we weren't able to see her during check-in because we arrived quite late in the evening, she had turned on the AC and a fan so that we would have a cool room in the heat of the summer. Also, there's a lovely balcony which is a nice addition if you're visiting during the spring or summer. ","9"
"Had a great visit in Montreal. Titi's place was clean, comfortable, and was in a great location. Meeting up to get the key was easy. I'd recommend her place for sure. ","9"
"Had no problems checking in or checking out, Titi was around and fast at responding to any questions. The apartment was in a great location within walking distance to most of the places we wanted to go. The room was comfortable and neat/tidy. Wifi was fast.

Thanks again!","9"
"Nice location, good apartment.","9"
"Titi was a fantastic host! She was kind, helpful and very friendly. We loved the decor of this apartment, and especially enjoyed the little balcony. The location however was UNBEATABLE. Very close to Mount Royal Park, Parc avenue, St. Laurent Street and a close Bixi bike ride to Old Montreal and Jean Talon Market. We had a fantastic stay and would absolutely come back and stay at Titi's place again, 5-stars!","9"
"My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay at Titi's apartment. It was in a perfect location, close walking distance to almost all the wonderful parts of Montreal. She was extremely hospitable when it came to us bringing along our dog too which made the trip so much easier for us. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend it to anyone heading to Montreal!","9"
"Great location. Walking distance to many of the sights in Montreal. Also a very short walk to a metro station. Restaurants, cafés, and grocery stores nearby as well. Overall, enjoyed my stay at the apartment. ","9"
"Me and my friend stayed there for the New Year's Eve. We had a great time and were able to walk to the old port. Titi was very nice and helpful and the place was really clean and cozy :)","9"
"Titi's place is a wonderful option for anyone looking to stay in the heart of Montréal at an affordable price. Her place is small, but quaint and clean and has everything you need as a solo traveler (would be good for couples too). Her apartment is only about 5 minutes walk to Place des Arts metro, which makes getting around the city super easy. Also, the fact that her place has an air conditioning unit is a nice plus during the hot summer months. Beyond that, communication with Titi was very timely and she was even nice enough to invite me to go out downtown with her and her friends on my first night there (though I ultimately wasn't able to due to other plans). Would definitely recommend this place and stay again in the future! ","9"
"Titi's place is located in a very convenient and safe location.","9"
"Titi was a very sympatetic, friendly and helpful host. Her apartement is in a perfect location and the balcony with great view is wonderful.","9"
"Place was clean and close to everything. Great location!","9"
"Tina was incredibly flexible and helpful throughout our planning and check-in. We arrived very late and Tina made sure to communicate and arrange everything for us. The location is unbeatable and the balcony was wonderful to relax on after a long day. 

We were close to the metro, lots of restaurants, a grocery store and everything you might need. 

The one thing we were not accustomed to, and this may be normal in Montreal, is the extreme firmness of the mattress. For those who are used to sleeping on softer mattresses, be aware this will not be your experience. 

We had a lovely time and were happy to stay at Tina's!","9"
"Great location and cute apartment. Would have loved to stay longer, actually!","9"
"Superb location ! Walking distance of a 24hrs coffee shop... Grocery store and so many late night restaurants....Not to mention - it’s near a metro

"L’appartement de Titi est idéalement placé à 2 pas de la place des arts permettant de profiter de Montréal très facilement à pied ou via le métro. 
Le studio est agréable à vivre pour 2 personnes, l’accueil s’est très bien passé grâce aux échanges avec Titi.
Nous recommandons vivement ce logement !
Merci Titi de nous avoir accueillis !","9"
"é um espaço simples, cheio de móveis, travesseiros muito ruins, poucos talheres. No entanto, está numa ótima localização, assim, se não for muito exigente, dá para aceitar o prédio velho, o apartamento com roupas da dona e atopetado de móveis. A hospedeira foi simpática.","9"
"Our stay was just GREAT! Titi is a perfect host, she answered quickly to any questions we had, gave us great suggestions and made us feel at home! The house is in a very quiet neibourhood, 2 min from a supermarket and 20 min on foot from the city center!","9"
"Very central location, close to good restaurants (I would recommend eating at Areperas and Kantapia). Very smooth communication. The kitchen equipment is quite minimal but sufficient for a short stay.","9"
"Great price and location! I was in contact with Libby (Toby's sister). She was very attentive and replied quickly to any questions I had. My friend slept in the bed and I asked to use the queen size air mattress (took less than 5 min to inflate with the provided electric device), but I ended up sleeping on the couch - it was super comfy (at least for my 5'4 height). Great experience here. ","10"
"L'appartement est tout à fait conforme au descriptif. Il n'y manque vraiment rien. Libby, en l'absence de Toby a tout prévu pour que l'on se sente chez soi, jusqu'à la brosse à dent, au cas où on l'aurait oubliée. Parfaitement situé pour avoir tout à portée de main (commerces, restaurants, transports) dans mon quartier préféré. Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer Libby et Toby mais la documentation était extrêmement précise et Libby était particulièrement réactive lors de nos échanges. J'y retournerai les yeux fermés et peut-être rencontrerai-je filles ?","10"
"Comfortable apartment in a fabulous neighborhood!  My husband and I loved staying here, walking and riding bikes in the neighborhood, and the convenient location. The apt. is close to shops, cafes and restaurants, Bixi bike stands, the park, main streets, and metro station. 

We did not get to meet the host but she communicated via email and text, arranged for a smooth arrival, and left lots of information about Montreal. There were maps, brochures, etc. for us to peruse. 

She even left some fruit and treats in the freezer for us to make us feel welcome and we enjoyed pretending we were locals by ""living"" in her apt. 

Good space, comfortable bed and couch, and outside balcony to sit on made the apt. perfect. 

We plan to return to Montreal as it is probably our favorite city and we would definitely choose to stay here again. ","10"
"I had great communication with Libby. Good, clear information and smooth check-in arrangements. The apartment is cozy and comfortable and feels very homey. It's in a great area of Montreal and even though there are many wonderful restaurants, the kitchen is well equipped for making a family dinner. Thanks Libby, we had a great time. ","10"
"11/10! Perfectly located (try Lili.co for brunch, Guillame for croissants and Green Panther if you're veggie!!) and super cute and cosy. Libby is a super host, absolutely recommend!!","10"
"Libby was great at communicating with us prior to and during the reservation. While she wasn't present in the apartment, she made herself available through phone and text, and left plenty of information in the apartment itself, including lots of tourist info, which was very helpful!

The colorful apartment is located in a really great neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, and stuff going on, all within walking distance to the building. It was also easily accessible to the metro, which made getting around the city a breeze.

The apartment itself is charming, and like the listing says, very colorful and with decorations from all over the world! Overall, it's a great place to stay and you won't be let down!","10"
"I dealt with Libby who was great. Very nice and welcoming. Their cleaner Rose waited an hour to welcome me as I was delayed in a nasty ice storm.  Thank her again for me Libby. The apartment is very nice clean and comfortable. The Plateau neighborhood is great with all the eateries cafes  shops and bars. Had a great time!","10"
"Cozy and bright apartment in the best neighbourhood in Montreal!

"Toby was an amazing host. Very kind and thoughtful.
Her place is perfectly located, clean, and with many little details to make your stay perfect. Definitely recommended +++","10"
"My husband, 11 year old son and I had a great stay at Toby and her sister Libby's place. The apartment is as advertised--very sweet with two small balconies, a full service kitchen (including spices), and an air-conditioner, as some of the stand-outs (and the latter was very helpful in July). The thing is that you won't want to spend that much time there because the neighborhood is amazing--which was also accurately advertised. We walked or took the metro everywhere and never used our car (we lucked out and found a parking spot right after the street had been cleaned and all the other cars had to move). There are so many great restaurants, cafes and boutiques nearby, and also a sweet park right at the top of the street. We walked to Mont Royal (and then walked to the top for an amazing view), and walked to the Metro stop to get to downtown (for free concerts at the Jazz Festival), the old port, and the Jean Talon market. Also, Libby was very helpful and available via email (and if my phone worked, I assume text as well); has lots of maps and brochures in the apartment for you to look at and use; and her housecleaner, who met us and gave us the keys, was lovely and full of tips about the city. We can't wait to come back and explore more! ","10"
"Best location and most gracious host I have ever had!","10"
"We love Mile End, so this was a perfect location for us. The apartment was bright, charming, and completely comfortable. Nice bed, cute kitchen with everything you need. Toby and her sister Libby were very responsive and  communicative. Great place to stay.","10"

I would definitely recommend!

"Toby and Libby's place was perfect for our long weekend in Montreal. They were extremely kind, thoughtful and accommodating. When we got delayed at the border and arrived much later than expected, they were very helpful to find a way to check us in. The place is very comfortable, has all what you need (well-equipped kitchen, washer, coffee machine, etc ), is well-located and definitely makes you feel like home. I absolutely recommend it!!","10"
"The perfect place to visit Montreal! Lovely, fully equipped, amazingly located apartment with a great and supportive host that leaves nothing to be desired! The place lies in the heart of the “Le Plateau / Mile End” neighbourhood(s); A great vibe, access to a supreme number of cute café's and unique bars, really great food, supermarkets, bakeries and anything you could possibly need…in a short walking distance. It’s minutes away from the Mont-Royal Metro station which in turn gets you to Old Town and Downtown in 5-10 minutes. Libby (Toby’s sister) and Hannah (who basically runs the place in Toby’s absence) went above and beyond what should be expected from an AirBnB host. Very nice and helpful…thank you so much! L'endroit idéal pour explorer Montréal et profiter du large choix de magasins, bars et de restaurants qu'offre le quartier du Plateau Mont-Royal/Mile End. Tout comme promis et décrit.","10"

The condo was spotless and beautiful and looked just as the picture described. The neighbourhood was lovely. Was only abou a 7 minute drive to downtown and we used uber! It was a locked and secure building. We have only amazing things to say about our stay and the host. Thank you again Manon!","10"

Parking was easy and the metro is a 10-15 minute walk.  Zoé is a great host and very quick to respond to any questions.  Check-in and check-out is very convenient. A great place to stay in Montreal.","9"
"Zoe was very nice and very responsive to any questions I had. The place was very modern, comfortable, and clean. I am a big clean freak so this place made me very comfortable in the cleanliness aspect. The only thing that was just a little frustrating at times was the lack of AC. Some rooms (at the front) were very hot if the doors were closed come morning time. However, seeing as most of us were out (not home) doing activities during the hot days, the nights were cool enough to open the windows, and Zoe provided a few fans, so it was manageable. Other than that, I highly recommend this place. Clean, comfortable, modernized, close to bus stops and subways, bike rental access across the street, not too far from downtown, and lots of restaurants and cafes in the area.","9"
"Simplement parfait! Propreté ,emplacement et communication étaient au rendez-vous!","9"
"Bel appart dans un beau quartier­. Et on est bien accueilli.","9"
"Zoé a été très réactive et accueillante. Très bel appartement et bien situé. Expérience à renouveler ! Je recommande.","9"
"Lovely place with a large living/dining/kitchen area. Easy on street parking a bonus.","9"
"Fantastic host, great apartment.","9"
"Logements très bien situé dans un quartier agréable.  Le métro est cependant un peu loin.
Hôte sympathique et discrète. ","9"
"Zoe was very nice and was pretty quick with fixing the unfortunate leak that was caused from the neighbors upstairs. But be aware there is NO WORKING A/C, there are only a few fans. My friend was bitten by bed bugs in the smallest room. Also expect to not have any cups available. Don't even bother with finding parking. The location was not bad.","9"
"Je vous le recommande!!! Très confortable et super bien placé!!!","9"
"Appartement très bien, comme à la maison, on s'y sent bien. Zoé est tres accueillante et à l'écoute. Appartement bien situé. (Bus, metro, dépanneurs...) ","9"
"Awesome design. The transportation is easy pretty mush everywhere. The neighborhood is very quite and beautiful. It's a lovely place.","10"
"Jen was very accomodating.  The room was fine, though being an old building you hear any conversations/people there.  Great location though, near the metro, plateau, mile end.  Lots of great restaurants nearby.","9"
"Plateau Montreal Artisinal is value for money.  The location is ideal and there is an excellent range of cafes, restaurants and bars handy.  The Metro is close by.  The accommodation was adequate and the breakfast was great.  This accommodation is more in the range of a guest house than a BnB.

"We really enjoyed our stay.  Great location – close to BIXI stand, metro, shops, restaurants and cafes.  Jen is super easy to get along with.","9"
"We had a great stay at Jen's place, It was  an old buliding but full of  characteristics, close to METRO, and shops.  The rooms are colorful with comfortable beds. Breakfast was excellent. Jen is very accomodating. i highly recommend Jen's place.","9"
"I do not recommend this place. I arrived on a hot day, there was no air condotion, bed much to small for a couple, room is dark and not appealing at all
The room description is definitely deciving
Not worth even to stay even for free!

"I stayed in Montreal for one night so my friends and I enjoyed Jen's hospitality!! The breakfast was really good, thanks for everything","9"
"This was a cute apartment in a very great location in Montreal.  Jen was a very helpful and generous host.  Breakfast was simple, but very delicious.  My only complaint was that the room is on a fairly busy street and when you have the window open in the morning (which is needed in the summer), it can be very load very early (~6am).  Other than that, it was a great place.  ","9"
"Jen's b&b is a great place to stay, she is very sweet, prepares breakfast with lots of love, the rooms and bathroom are super clean, great location and very independent, it is easy to feel at home.
Also, you should try Jen's massage, she is awesome!","9"
"Great location. Nice breakfast. Jen was a pleasant and informative host. I'm very glad I did this for my first trip to Montreal and I would definitely do this again.","9"
"Jen is a great host--very accommodating, makes a lovely breakfast with endless cups of coffee and her rooms are all neat and clean. The location is perfect and within walking distance of lots of great food and Montreal sights. Our room had a fan but others might find the lack of air conditioning challenging in the summer. We had a really nice stay.","9"
"It was perfect! the house is charming and you feel like in your own home. Jen is very welcoming and her breakfast is delicious. A very great host!
I've already decided to come back.. Thanks Jen!","9"
"We booked with Jen pretty last minute and found her to be very cooperative and accommodating. The location is centrally located, right next to a subway stop and near everything Montreal has to offer. Jen made us a delicious bagel breakfast in the morning, and was very flexible with our check-in/check-out time.","9"
"The place was great. Jen was very hospitable and we had a really comfortable and fun visit to Montreal","9"
"Great place in a really handy location very easy to see the city, on a lovely street full of restaurants and shops. Very nice building with old school charm, very arty feel. Beds where comfortable room was large and airy with huge window. no air con but the fan in the room worked grand. Wifi and free parking was an extra bonus. Breakfast every morning was lovely. If I get back to Montreal I will stay there again.","9"
"We were in town just for one night, and Jen's place worked great!  Very easy to arrive, and everyone was very friendly.","9"
"Jen was very welcoming and responsive.  She and her friend provided a delicious and substantive breakfast in the morning.  Nice neighborhood right on St. Denis.  Large sunny room with comfy queen mattress. Fun and funky decor, nice little terrace and ktichen.  Couple of things: 1)  there are two bathrooms- one with toilet, the other with sink and bathtub.  The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!  Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note.  Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgable hosts.
","9"
"Jen was a gracious host and very friendly. The accomodations were more than adequate and breakfasts were yummy.  We even got a free concert in the bargain.","9"
" We strongly recommend this location. We would surely stay here again in the future.
NOTE: There are 3 rooms at this location. 2 of them face St Denis, and this is a busy street with traffic noise. The 1 room in the back, away from St Denis, is much quieter. This is our favorite room.
The location, one block from Metro/Laurier is excellent. The building is from 1890, and has a lot of character. There are 2 flights of stairs to get up to the rooms.
Jen is a very welcoming and conscientious host. She went beyond our expectations and helped us with some issues with our room and the AirBNB website. We are most appreciative.
Breakfast was very good.
We stayed here for one week. in 2 of the 3 rooms. (BTW: The beds in these 2 rooms are folders, and are a bit harder than we like.)","9"
"This is a fine place to stay. Jen is calm, welcoming, and has a nice sense of humor.","9"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Jen's B&B.  Rooms were airy and clean with a kind of artistic feel that I fell immediately in love with.  B&B is in a great central location, surrounded by many great shops, restaurants, and bars, and near Metro station.  Jen is welcoming, enthusiastic, and warm.  Yummy, filling breakfast was a great start to each morning!","9"
"I really enjoyed my stay at Plateau Montreal Artisinal B&B. The room was just right, the bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent with metro and bixie bike options just round the corner. There are some nice little restaurants across the street as well. I slept in each day and Jen and Theresa were very kind about leaving out my breakfast for me. I felt quite at home.","9"
"Very well located, one of the best restaurant in town across the street, walking distance to Montreal vibrant life.

Building is old but comfortable, rooms are big (ask for the one on the backside it's very quiet).

Jen has been very arranging, considering my impossible schedule ! Great host !!

","9"
"Loved the funky charm of this place...the colours, artwork and ideal neighbourhood made for a comfortable stay. Jen was a good host and made me feel welcome.
Tracy","9"
"Jen was very accommodating and helpful!  We were delayed by 2 hrs and arrived close to midnight and she waited for us to arrive and was very nice in assisting us in settling in.  The place is located in a fun neighborhood, and right near the Metro.  Highly recommend!","9"
"Jen is very friendly and helpful and the place is very laidback, comfortable and well located.","9"
"Awesome location! Eclectic house that made us feel like we were living in the heart of Montreal. Great base for explorations. Jen provided great service.","9"
"Jen's place is private, clean and very central to everything.
I enjoyed staying here. Jen would come and visit everyday (as she lives a few blocks away) and would have breakfast and fresh fruits for you in the morning. She was also great company and would have a little chat with you :)
I would highly recommend your stay here if you're visiting Montreal.","9"
"What an awesome place to stay in Montreal.  So close to Laurier metro station, this bnb is the perfect way to simulate how the locals live in this beautiful city.  Jen was a great host, she pops in everyday to make sure everything is ok in the house and you'll hopefully get to meet some fantastic guests as I did.  If I ever go back to Montreal I will definitely stay her as you feel like you're living in someone's house and the owner isn't home :)

If you are a light sleeper I would strongly recommend asking for the back bedroom or the one in the middle (it doesn't have any windows so if you're a fresh air freak that might be something to take into consideration).  I had the large room at the front and it was massive; I sleep with ear plugs and a couple of nights the traffic kept me awake, but overall I loved staying here 100%.

Direction from the metro - when you get off the tube (if heading north on Montmorency direction) go towards the exit that doesn't have stairs visible.  There'll be an escalator and then a flight of stairs and exit at the Gilford doors.  As you look right this is the bus stop, I think they terminate here and it looks like a dead end street.  There's a street that veers off to the left and at the end there's some traffic lights (you'll walk past some restaurants on the left, a pizza joint on the corner on the right), when you're standing next to the pizza place, cross over the road (across the 4 lanes, not the crossing that flows with the traffic) and the door is basically right there in front of the lights.  There's no sign indicating the name of the bnb, just keep an eye out for the door as it's a bit hard to see at first.  It's in between the shops and I walked past it the first time.","9"
"This is a nice place to stay.  Jen was helpful in telling us about places to go for food, music, etc.  It's right on Saint-Denis, a good spot for restaurants and beer.  Accomodations were basic but comfortable.
","9"
"I had a great stay! The location is excellent near the metro and it is in a really nice area. It was so easy to get around. I loved having so much common space to hang out in and I really like the style of the B&B. There are a lot of neat instruments and art. I also like the make your own breakfast style (she makes sure the kitchen is stocked with nice fruit, bagels, eggs, etc) and having a place to cook if needed. Jen is very welcoming and checks up to make sure all is well. My stay was short, but staying here made my Montreal experience awesome.","9"
"Jen went out of her way to ship some things we'd left behind. She's a kind and gracious host, and her place is in a great location.
I'd recommend this place to anyone.","9"
"Jen is a very lovely and friendly host. She was easily contacted for questions and recommendations throughout my stay. Her B&B is in an traditional Montreal home and was very charming. The fruits and bagels were a nice and welcome touch! The only minor issue would be the fact that some of the rooms are right on St.Denis--so if you are sensitive to noise (e.g. traffic) you may want to ask for a room at the back or bring ear plugs. 

","9"
"Great place, very cozy and relaxing at a great price. Also it's in a really cool area which was great to explore and very easy to get downtown. Jen is really accommodating and very sweet. Highly recommended! ","9"
"Jen was a lovely host. She has a very welcoming and easy going personality  and provided helpful  information about the area and places of interest. The apartment is conveniently located; it is close to restaurants & nightlife and also has a  metro line nearby.
There is a shared bathroom but other  house guests staying at the same time as us were very considerate.","9"
"Jen has a really cool place that's super easy to find. It has a fantastic old-style charm and the other people that were staying there were very friendly :) I recommend this place for sure, if you want to take the metro, use Laurier station, but for the best restaurants near by, walk in the other direction towards mont royal station :) :)","9"
"We had a great stay! The location was perfect for us - a few minutes from the metro, and within 15 mins of our favourite cafes and pubs. I had anticipated that the house may be cold given it was old (and the time of year), but it was nice and toasty. The house is pretty creaky, and there was a fair amount of noise from the street, so if you're a light sleeper it may not be for you.  We didn't find it a problem, and would definitely stay there again. ","9"
"Jen's Artisinal B&B is an artsy, shabby-chic multi-dwelling home right on Rue St. Denis in Montreal.  As such, it is perfectly situated between the English-speaking/hipster side of town and then French-speaking side of town.  Moreover, the inn is an easy walk to Mont Royal park, old town, and to most of the major attractions in the city center.  For any further out destinations, you will find yourself a mere block away from the Laurier Metro Station. All amenities were provided by Jen, including bagel breakfasts, internet access, bedding, towels and basic toiletries.  Accommodations were perfect.","9"
"We arrived at this two-storey residence very easily from the Amtrak station. Jen was home when we arrived to let us in. She showed us around briefly and then let us be to ourselves. Despite sharing the building with other guests, our room was very private. We were very comfortable and the location in the city is very close to restaurants, cafes, and Metro stations and bus lines. We had a great stay! Recommended for either couples or families with children. ","9"
"Jen runs a very pleasant B&B in a wonderful and conveniently located neighborhood of Montreal. She was very reliable both in her communication before arrival and in setting us up for a lovely stay. We would love to stay again!","9"
"I am so happy to have chosen this place. I'm a dj who drove to Montreal from Vermont with a gig that ended at 2am. Jen met me at the B&B at 2am, with keys in hand and a pleasant smile. My room was clean and I feel in love with the Frida Khalo inspired bathroom. super clean and warm during those wintery night. great deal. ","9"
"Jen's B&B was the perfect place for our first Montreal (and airbnb) experience. From the start Jen was quick to respond and helpful with information.. she is a great host and seems to run the b&b professionally. We had to postpone our plans due to a snowstorm but Jen could accommodate us a day late with no problem, which was much appreciated. The Mile End area was a great location to get a well-rounded idea of the city, we were really happy to have ended up there instead of some other locations we were considering. The house is old but it has tons of charm. We were lucky to have the whole space to ourselves the first night.. after a full day of walking around we made dinner in the kitchen and spent the evening playing with instruments in the living room. The next night there was a full house which got a little noisy due to echoing voices and creaky floors.. but really not a problem. This may be petty to mention but I would recommend bringing your own pillow if you prefer sleeping a little elevated. Overall it was a pleasant, fun and hassle free visit to Montreal, we would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Good location in the vibrant neighborhood ""Plateau"" and vintage spot. Metro station just nearby. Jen is not living in the apartment, so if you need advices for your stay, prepare questions when you meet the first day. The breakfast was very basic. Generally, we promote it for young travelers. ","9"
"Jen's place was great! The location especially. Everything was right around the corner, just brilliant.
The room was a comfortable and Jen left bagels and cream cheese out each morning for breakfast, YUM!!

Would thoroughly recommend.","9"
"Excellent location just a little distance from the metro and walking distance to lots of places on rue St Denis and the Mont Royal. 
Breakfast supplied was very much appreciated and Jen also responded quickly to any requests we made.
This was our first experience with an Airbnb flat and Jen has set a  very high benchmark for any future hosts we use. Thanks Jen","9"
"I felt very comfortable in this beautiful space!  The location was convenient in the Plateau.","9"
"Jen was very helpful, (especially in figuring out Montreal parking regulations) and the accommodation were in a nice historic building and great location. As mentioned by others the short helpful guide that was left in the room was nice to have too.
","9"
"Jen is a great host! The B&B was really nice, close to everything: metro, bixi bikes, shops, Miles End, Little Italy, Outrement...Very cool to stay in this authentic place during the week I had a conference in Montreal. ","9"
"Thank you, Jen, for your opinion about us.
Concerning the pair of trousers, is it possible to get them next saturday, about 1 or 2 pm?

I have problems with my phone web. 
At the moment, we are in Quebec city. May our guess, Anick  Gosselin, phone you tonight.
Many thank
Bernard","9"
"I stayed for 3 nights at Jen's place. I felt at home straight away and experienced Jen as flexible and friendly host. So yes, I definitely recomment staying at the B&B! ","9"
"Jen's place was great!  Very well located in the Plateau and close to a metro station for further city exploration.  Jen welcomed us, took the time to show us around the house and answered all the questions we had.  She also showed us travel books on Montreal and area for guests.  We also appreciated that she gave us directions for a free parking near the house.  That was super helpful!
On the downside of things, a little general cleaning of the place would be useful to make the overall experience an excellent one!","9"
"We really enjoyed our stay at Jen's . The flat has character and feels like home. decorated with good taste. The place is ideally located and very close to nice bars and restarants. We appreciated the morning bagels very much ! a very good experience and Jen was perfect with the communication ! we would love to go back !","9"
"It was a very quaint place in a great part of town. Nothing bad to say!","9"
"Jen was a great host. Super nice, helpful, and gave us a lot of information about Montreal.  The place is in a GREAT location, close to everything. Wifi was great.  I recommend this place if you are on a budget, but looking for easy access to everything Montreal has to offer!    ","9"
"Excellent location!  Lots of great restaurants and shopping nearby.  Just a short walk to the Metro.  Jen was very helpful in terms of navigating the city and public transport.  Overall, great!  Thanks again!","9"
"Quirky place in the absolute perfect location. Tons of boutiques along the same street, and walking distance to most places worth seeing. Jen was a genuinely kind host and willing to offer advice on the area. Plus, I met two really awesome travelers at the B&B... seems to be a place that attracts interesting people!","9"
"We had a great experience at Jen's B&B!  Went up to Montreal for the jazz festival, and Jen's place was a great deal.  Not expensive, perfectly clean, and above all well-situated in the city (one block from the subway and located in the great Plateau area with lots to do/eat nearby).  The only drawback was that the B&B isn't air-conditioned (same goes for many buildings in Montreal), but it worked fine for us because we got the one room with the AC unit.","9"
"Great! Awesome!! Fantastic!!! Very Nice And colourful House in the Place to be.","9"
"Jen was an excellent host!  She was very flexible about our late arrival and gave us some great information about the neighborhood and tips for getting around Montreal.  We didn't see her for the rest of the weekend, but she was available via email or phone in case we needed anything.  The room and house were beautiful and we especially enjoyed the delicious Montreal bagels for breakfast.  Thanks Jen!","9"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Plateau Montreal B&B. This is a lovely old apartment – large, bright, full of Quebecois character¬, and very well located just a short walk from the Laurier Metro. The shared bathroom and common areas worked well for me as I enjoyed socializing with the other travellers and felt very safe and comfortable. Our host Jen was welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed. This was my first AirB&B experience, and one I would gladly recommend to others. ","9"
"Appartement très bien situé dans un quartier très agréable
Confort assez sommaire, bien adapté à  des jeunes
Bon rapport qualité prix
Contact très agréable avec J'en","9"
"La chambre est idéalement située, proche du métro, dans un quartier dynamique et très vivant en soirée. La maison est pleine de charme et propre. Nous avons eu un peu l'impression d'être dans une auberge de jeunesse, plusieurs chambres étant louées avec des voisins tous les jours différents. Jen est très sympathique mais n'habite pas sur place, il faut donc l'appeler et lui donner rendez-vous à l'arrivée.","9"
"Lieu pittoresque plein de charme et propre. Les propriétaires n'habitent pas sur place mais étaient là pour nous accueillir. 
Plutôt bien situé, seul bémol notre chambre donnait sur la rue St Denis qui reste bruyante la nuit. ","9"
"This was our first air bnb and Jen was really friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay in Montreal and felt the location was perfect as a base for seeing the city.","9"
"Jen's room worked out fine for me.  The location was primo, easy short walk to the Laurier Metro stop and Bixi bikes, on St Denis, close to Mont Royal and St Laurent.  Breakfast was strictly do it yourself:  bagels, cream cheese and orange juice provided.  There was a bathtub which was important to me and which I enjoyed.  An air conditioner and fan kept the room cool.","9"
"Jen et son mari ont une maison très charmante et colorée qu'ils vous laissent avec les autres hôtes. Notre chambre était côté rue mais pas bruyante la nuit. 

Une bonne adresse bien située pour visiter Montréal !","9"
"Logement bien situé avec le métro au pied de l'immeuble , ou bien on peut rejoindre le centre ville a pied en 25 min. 
Belle appartement coloré et propre. 
 ","9"
"I felt well attended to, the only down  was the front room close to St Denis was so noisy until at least midnight.","9"
"We had to wait 15 minutes to meet Jen for the check-in.  However, she was supremely flexible in the first place, allowing me to set the check-in time and only a day prior to arrival.  The floors squeak quite a lot as do the doors, at least to our room ""The Plateau."" Its all pretty great after that though.  The room had a working fan AND an air-condition window unit.  The windows are huge and easy to open, good drapes to boot, They were easy to snap open and close.  Easy access to a vegan AND raw food restaurant, 15min walk.  Fully stocked kitchen with tea, fruit, bagels; great bathrooms.  Really would stay here again.  Thank you for the effort Jen!","9"
"I enjoyed my stay at Jen's place. Her place is clean, and is located at a convenient place near a metro station.  Jen was also very helpful and accomodating - prior to me arriving, she helped to provide very clear instructions on getting to her place from the airport.  And on the day I left, since I had a late flight, she allowed me to lock my bags away in a spare room so that I could still explore around during the day, which I very much appreciated!  ","9"
"Nice place, great location!
","9"
"Bon emplacement pour cette petite maison sur deux étages, décoration originale type un peu bohème. Acceuil par Jesse, le compagnon de Jen. Sympathique et cool. Je ne suis resté qu'une nuit. Jesse m'a gentiment proposé de rester le lendemain jusqu'à 14h exceptionnellement, car j'avais passé la nuit à être malade. Attention que j'ai beaucoup apprécié. ","9"
"Jen's place was perfectly located. Clean, bright and comfortable, I highly recommend this location for anyone travelling through Montreal. Jen was also very accommodating with late arrivals and late check-out time which my travel plans included. two thumbs up!","9"
"Jen saved my behind & my kid's! We made a last minute decision to go to Montreal for an event. While there, I sent various inquiries & while most people responded that they needed more advance notice, Jen responded that her place was ready & available! (There are various rooms that are rented.) And the location in Plateau area is fabulous! If you are not looking for the Hilton, then this place is quite comfortable & convenient. And to boot, Jen provides the material to make your own tea, coffee & bagels for breakfast. That was just an added bonus. We will definitely return on future trips!","9"
"Comfortable and quiet, we didn't meet Jen but her husband Jesse was very welcoming.  Lovely place for a night and very central. ","9"
"Jen was a friendly and helpful host, our accommodation was unique and in a great location. We had a wonderful family day weekend in Montreal.","9"
"Jen was great at accommodating my partner and I at the last minute,  which was a relief! The place was very colorful and has fun items, like guitars and a ukulele. It was very nice having a kitchen where we could cook. The place is in a great location in Montreal - close to Mt. Royal and directly on a busy street with tons of nice places to eat and yoga studios, etc. The bus station is a 1 minute walk, too! Our only complaint was that the place did not appear to be cleaned very well - if you like things to be really nice and clean, you probably would not want to stay here. The place was well loved, but not in a cleaning sort of way.","9"
"Great price for an bed in a great location. The plateau neighbourhood is awesome. If I'm nitpicking, the pillows are flat. The bagels were great, and the apartment had a lot of character. ","9"
"Thank you Jen! This was the perfect accommodation for my night in Montréal","9"
"We had a really nice stay at Jen's place.
This colorfull house is comfortable and perfectly located!
Jen is sympathical and really arranging.

We clearly recomend it!","9"
"Jen's house is nice and colorfull, and very well situated to visit Montreal; I would really recommand it !","9"
"We spent four days here and everything was great. It's a beautiful old apartment with several bedrooms and a spacious common area downstairs, with a kitchen and living room. Right on St-Denis, it's quick to get on the metro and you're in a great neighbourhood for walking around. Jen's a great host, friendly, and leaves you to your own devices.","9"
"Room was clean and tidy. Jen made accommodations without hesitation (thanks for the towels!) Even with a second guest down the hall, the place was quiet and allowed for a lot of privacy. 

Bagels and coffee in the morning was a nice touch. Will stay there again!","9"
"This was a clean, lovely room in a great bnb. Really close to the metro and  the best neighbourhoods. Met a few fun people who were also staying here.
Disappointed that I didn't make time to get a massage from Jen, the host.","9"
"We really enjoyed our stay at Jen's bnb! The apartment is in a great location, a block from the train station and right near many restaurants and shops. The apartment is very nice and clean, Jen is really helpful and friendly with any questions you might have. We would definitely recommend staying here, it was perfect for our stay in Montreal.  ","9"
"I loved Jen's flat! Very cute and charming. Everywhere you turn there is artwork and adorable knickknacks throughout. The location is great,  its very close to the metro and a plethora of restaurants. Jen is a great host, I would absolutely stay there again!","9"
"I really enjoyed staying at Jen's.  The place is very well situated, close to the metro, and the shops and there are very nice bars and restaurants close by.I didn't have much time to see Jen but she was available in case I needed her! I would certainly recommend this address.","9"
"Great place.  Very convenient and wonderful overall.  Would stay again for sure.","9"
"Nice place to stay and close to everything you need in Montreal. I would come back!","9"
"Everything was great at Jen's.  Jen had some good tips for us about Montreal and was very friendly.","9"
"Great host and apartment in superb location! Jen was very friendly, the apartment was clean and the fruit and bagels for breakfast were a nice extra touch!

Thanks so much, I'll be back on my next trip!","9"
"My friend and I loved staying here. The location is amazing and the vibe is like a cool, eclectic hostel that allows the privacy of your own room. I loved the lending library (with Montreal tour books!) and Jen was nice enough to leave out tea,  Fairmount bagels, and fruit for guests. The only downside for me is that I found the mattress uncomfortable. That being said, I am really picky about sleeping surfaces and generally don't sleep well on any kind of futon mattress. My friend slept just fine and had no complaints. ","9"
"Jen was an excellent and helpful host! She was very friendly at check-in and offered excellent suggestions for places to eat and things to do around the neighborhood.
 
The location of the Airbnb couldn't have been more perfect, extremely walkable to many restaurants and shops! First time in Montreal, and feel very lucky that friends who had stayed at this location recommended this Airbnb to me. The BIXI bike share system has many docking stations near the Airbnb location, and the Laurier Metro station is just a couple blocks away. The maps and guidebooks in the apartment were great to have as references!","9"
"I would describe this property more as a ""hostel with delicious bagels"" than a ""B&B,"" but that's perfectly ok.  What it does well, it does really well!  We had the room pictured in the airbnb profile and it was nice--a good size, and clean.  The rest of the building is older, a bit shabby, but definitely clean and more than adequate.  There is one bathroom and several other bedrooms that are rented out.  Getting bathroom time and hot water were never a problem, even though others were staying.  The kitchen and other common areas, including back garden balcony, are nice too.

This airbnb stay was a little different in that we didn't interact with the hosts much.  We actually never met Jen.  Instead, her husband Jesse met us and let us into our room.  He was welcoming and showed us around.  There was also a handy welcome sheet in the room with wifi info, restaurant suggestions, etc.  (The pizza restaurant across the street is great!)

The neighborhood is fantastic, and definitely what makes this place such a great deal.  It's very close to the metro, restaurants, and a little grocery store.  If you like walking vacation, you can definitely walk downtown or to the old city from the location.  

It was a good place to stay, and I'd recommend it to others.","9"
"Our stay at Jen's was fantastic! The B&B was beautiful and very cool, there was awesome art everywhere in the house! Jen was very accommodating and nice! She also gave us great advice on where to check out some cool bars and an awesome vegan restaurant! We were also close to everything :D Thank you Jen for such a great trip... and the bagels! ","9"
"The house is located on Rue St. Denis, een busy street with many shops and restaurants. It is also quite close to Laurier metro station.
The house itself looked more like a hostel than a house. It is shabby, needs repair and a good cleaning.","9"
"Easy email-contact to Jen and nice welcoming by Jesse. I liked my room for the 2 nights. With my ear plugs I could sleep quite well despite of the traffic noise. Self-service breakfast is o.k. for me. Other people may need a hint at the airbnb-description. All the best, Heribert (Germany)
(Sorry, but my English has got a bit rusty :-)","9"
"We had a lovely trip to Montreal while staying with Jen. The B&B is in a wonderful location - close enough to walk downtown, and surrounded by many, many delicious restaurants and bars. We used bixi to get around and there were several stops closeby. The room was a nice size and the bathroom and kitchen were kept clean during our entire stay.","9"
"Jen was very nice! The location is fantastic and everything true to the description. I stayed for about a week and it was great to have an apartment-y feeling place rather than a hotel, you can really make yourself at home. The living area is really nice with a sun room and living room, great for reading or making coffee and doing some work in the morning.

Cleanliness-wise it could be a little better - wasn't horrible but the room could have used a dusting, and the closet was slightly musty smelling.

All in all I would recommend it for the location and the bed and breakfast set up - needless to say I ate a lot of bagels!","9"
"Nice place, clean and quite","9"
"My partner and myself enjoyed staying at Jen's place. She was a good host, she was there and received us warmly when we arrived, giving us plenty of tips from parking to eating out, or visiting places. 
The location itself is great, in the middle of the Plateau with many small cafes, bakeries and nice restaurants around. It's also walking distance to the Mont Royal.
The place it's full of character and despite the room colours didn't look as vibrant as I was expecting from the pictures, it still looks funky and has a nice vibe.
My only issue was the noise from the street plus some noises on the first night, as someone was going in and out from the room next door and the door was banging. However I slept perfectly after wearing some ear plugs, plus I know I'm quite sensitive to noises.","9"
"Jen was great she was super accommodating of any changes that I had. The location is in the heart of the city and right around all of the bars, restaurants, and nightlife activities. It is extremely accessible by train to get quickly and easily around the city. ","9"
"Le point fort de cet appartement est sans aucun doute sa localisation. À deux pas du métro Laurier. À 5 min du croisement St-Denis/Mt-Royal. Il n'y a pas de meilleur endroit pour flâner sur le plateau !","9"
"Jen was very welcoming and helpful. We spend a good time there. The apartment was shared with other travelers. We felt like we were in a youth hostel. The apartment is well equipped and we had all we needed. The breakfast is included, that is a good point.

Thanks !","9"
"A nice stay. The location is simple, clean and central.","9"
"Jen is a very good host, taking her time to show you around the place and answering all your questions. The room is spacious and well located at Rue Saint-Denis. Definitely recommended!","9"
"Accueil très chaleureux, Jen vous met tout de suite à l'aise. L'appartement est situé sur le Plateau, près des transports et de divers lieux pour sortir. Je ne suis resté qu'un weekend, mais très bonne expérience à renouveler.","9"
"Jen was a great host! She was accommodating of my later arrival time and helped me navigate the streets of Montreal to find parking, which isn't that easy. When I first arrived, she gave me a tour of the lodging, which matched what was described on the listing page, and even had a laminated quick-tips sheet with house rules and some helpful tips for getting around the city. I would be happy to stay here again.","9"
"Jen was a great host and flexible with our delayed arrival time. Although we didn't meet her, she was quick to answer the phone when we had questions. The apartment was comfortable and welcoming. The breakfast a really nice touch. I will definately stay here again and recommend it to others who want to be in a great location and a funky clean apartment.","9"
"It was a pleasure to stay at Jen's place. She was really helpful and the room was lovely. The house's location was also excellent. 100% recommended.","9"
"Fantastic position, close to the station and all amenities. Although the house was lovely, it needed a clean, nothing major just a bit dusty and the bins weren't emptied during our stay. Check in was easy, and Jen was very flexible with our late and changing check in time. ","9"
"Jen's place was funky, clean and well located. A great spot to stay in Montreal!","9"
"Excellent place to stay in Montreal. It is very convenient and close to the metro station to bus station. And also, it is a safe place to stay even thought you come back at midnight from metro. The host is very nice and considerate. I will choose this place when I visit Montreal again. ","9"
"Jen's B&B was a lovely place to stay! It's in a great location, easy to walk through the Plateau and Mile-End neighbourhoods, and was clean and comfortable.","9"
"Dave and I both loved staying at Jen's bed and breakfast. It was exactly what we were looking for. It was so charming and colorful. It was nice having access to the bagels and tea. Jen and her husband were very helpful with finding parking when we arrived so that we could avoid getting parking tickets.

The bed and breakfast was located in a great area - it's an easy walk to plenty of great restaurants and Mont Royal. We walked almost everywhere, but there was a metro stop very close. We would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Jen's place is in a great location, very close to public transport, great restaurants and shopping. The house has a lot of character and charm, I recommend sitting on the back balcony with a cup of tea in the afternoon! Our room was a little dusty, but apart from that the place was generally pretty clean and as described in the listing. ","9"
"Excellent location, great price! Classic old style Montreal apartment, creaking hinges and all. Very laid back, only one other couple staying that weekend. Had the kitchen and back balcony to ourselves when we were there. Food, Bixi Bike rental, Bistro's, depaneurs... all within a block or two. Great if your just looking for a taste of city living.



","9"
"Jen's place was easy to get to from the Metro, and she was there to greet us when we arrived. She was very friendly and gave us several recommendations for restaurants/pubs in the area. The place itself was funky and quaint. It's definitely an older apartment, but for the price and the location, it's worth it. As a bonus, Jen kept local bagels stocked in the kitchen for breakfast!","9"
"She was going out of town the day we arrived, but she was still able to show us around the apartment. The description of the place is accurate, no frills. The neighborhood is THE BEST part about this place.

The only thing that caught us by surprise is that the toilet and the rest of the bathroom are in two different rooms. So at one point I wasn't able to use the bathroom to wash my hands after using the toilet because someone was in there...but that only happened once.

And one thing that was slightly irksome for me personally was one of the pillows that had little support, but I'm also used to thick, fluffy pillows, sometimes stacking one top of the other; so take this part of the review in with a grain of salt.

We were really looking to just crash for the night and take in Montreal as much as we can, so we weren't in the house very much. It was very low-key and enjoyable.","9"
"After travelling the world and staying in hostels, the warm thoughtful reception at Jens place was a breathe of fresh air. So obvious that she's an experienced host who is used to dealing with travellers and their needs.  Caring thoughtful host with a well kept room in a fun funky neighborhood with rock bottom prices......what more could i ask for?","9"
"10/10 would recommend!
Great place, plenty of character and artsy feel as well as space (rare to find in the plateau), the pictures didn't do the room justice as it was bigger than expected. The location is just amazing being so close to the metro, as well as the plateau being such desirable place to live. Also, the A/C was a godsend on the couple days where it got really hot!
There was an issue with the tub at one point but it was fixed very quickly.
There were a couple other girls renting separate rooms and we all got along and I even ended up making close friends with one!
Jen was just great, she made sure we were comfortable, let us know all the spots nearby, came by to clean and was quick to respond, super accommodating.","9"
"Had a wonderful stay! A great, safe place for a single traveler like myself. The location was perfect and the price was very affordable. I highly recommend it for budget solo travelers! ","9"
"It was nice to stay here for the week, near from subway and restaurants! The host was very nice and my roommate of the week were nice too!","9"
"The studio is nice and comfortable, located just next to rue Saint Denis. Maria was very helpful and responsive. She prepared everything perfectly:) We had no problems with finding the place and move around. ","9"
"As for location, you can't get any better! It's in the heart of Montreal. A short walk from le Vieux Port/ Old Montreal (1.5km with a slight hill). Be forewarned that since it's in the middle of downtown, it's not going to be quiet.This is no fault to the hostess, just that this city rarely sleeps - which, depending on who you are is a blessing or annoyance. Laundry is 10 blocks away since the hostess isn't in town, the sheets may not be clean so you'll have to do them yourself. Maria is always available via text so very helpful. If you drive, underground parking is a block away. Rental bikes are also close by. I would definitely stay there again for a quick weekend visit to Montreal.","9"
"The host left a pleasant note with some directions about the wifi and wished us a great trip. The description matched the room perfectly. The neighbourhood was lively and exciting!","9"
"Good home base!","9"
"Ultra-quick confirmation, fast communication and the apartment that fits the description perfectly. Great host.","9"
"Pros: Great location. Great host. Cozy studio. Bed is comfortable. Clean. Perfect to spend a night or two in.

Cons: Not for light sleepers (loud fridge, loud entrance door that residents tend to slam).

","9"
"Very convenient and flexible. Thanks maria","9"
"We had a great overnight stay here. The location is perfect and Maria had left us with everything we would need for a comfortable stay.  She was very quick to respond when we had a question about parking. We would love to stay at Maria's again next time we're in Montreal :)","9"
"Host able to have key ready early thanks","9"
"The studio was cute, clean and comfortable. The keys were right where Maria said they would be. The neighborhood, as promised, was within easy walking distance of many bars, restaurants, and other attractions. ","9"
"Great place. Accessible host. Convenient location. And overall amazing time.","9"
"Great host would stay again","9"
"Location can't be beat! Great value in a lively and fun neighborhood!","9"
"Maria’s place was great! It's a great location, there are lots of bars/restaurants to choose from within a 2 minute walk. If you are coming in by bus, this spot is only a 3 minute walk from the station.   ","9"
"Great location, perfect for a single traveller or a couple!","9"
"Central location, suitable for a short stay.","9"
"Great little space at a super affordable price! We absolutely loved our stay here","9"
"Appartement à 10min à pied de la gare de bus, très pratique pour les personnes désirant faire une étape avant de voyager.","9"
"My husband and I stayed at Celine's studio on Rue Dolbeau for a few days at the beginning of August. It was a perfect setup!  The studio was comfortable, immaculate, and close to public transportation, cabs, and places to grab a bite to eat.  This was our first time using Air B&B so we were a little nervous, but Celine was an ideal host!  She was easy to communicate with, kind and welcoming.  She even left us some coffee to brew in the mornings.  Celine is wonderful and so is her place!","9"
"The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Nice large studio in a quiet area. Very close to a bus stop which can take you towards the eastern part of the city, fairly close (~15 mins walk) to a few subway stations. Fairly cheap for that time of the year, considering what you get.

The host was very nice and responsive. Our flight was delayed by 2 hours so we got there at midnight and our check-in was still very smooth.","9"
"Celine was a great host.  She accommodated a last minute reservation and an early morning check in and went out of her way to solve minor house issues.  The place was clean and well supplied with utensils, coffee/tea, and all the things to make it easy to live away from home for a few days.  The place is close to transit and a nice 24 hour farmers market.  The bed is a futon -- so not perfect for everyone.  Overall, good experience.","9"
"Tyler was a great host and gave very prompt replies. The apartment was quite clean and in an amazing neighbourhood that was close to many stores, restaurants and subway stations. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone!","9"
"Tyler was amazing, friendly and very accommodating! The apartment was clean and in an excellent location, walking distance to restaurants and all areas of the city. We really felt at home and we would definitely love to stay here again our next time in Montreal! Tyler ensured that we were happy during our stay and we would definitely recommend to anyone!","9"
"Good location and great apartment; just as described. Didn't meet Tyler but information was clear and check in went smoothly. Small issue with the parking spot but in the end we managed to leave the car there during our stay. Think we managed to pick out the coldest day of the week so after exploring the city we enjoyed a cosy night in, watching Netflix :) Would definitely stay here again if we return to Montréal.","9"
"Tyler's apartment is located in downtown Montreal at a very convenient location. There are numerous bars and restaurants in the area. And the metro is only a few blocks away. This made getting around really easy. 

The apartment itself is lovely. Spacious, well lit and clean. It even has Netflix for the time you spend indoors. All this helped to make our visit pleasurable. 

While Tyler was not around, he provided all the details required for us to access the apartment via text. This went off without a hiccup. 

Oh yes, there is a dedicated parking space too. Which is always a bonus when you have a car in the city.

Overall, I would definitely chose to stay here again when I visit Montreal. Thanks Tyler! ","9"
"Tyler was very friendly and welcoming. he's prompt in his replies and provides very good dining and drinks suggestions. 

His apartment was great as well. Clean and tidy. The location is perfect too. There were many eateries and bars around. The parking provided was very near the apartment too. 

Thanks for having us!","9"
"Nous avons passé un super séjour chez Tyler, son logement est très bien situé, tt est facile d'accès à pieds ou en transports... L'appartement a apparemment été rénové eecemment et a une déco sonre et contemporaine. ","9"
"Our stay at Tyler's place was great. He made sure that his friend meets us upon our arrival, shows us the parking and the apartment, even though we arrived quite late.
The apartment itself is very nice, with lots of character and effort put in its renovation and decoration. It is located on a quiet street, but just steps from Rue St Catherine where all the shops and restaurants are. Having an assigned parking spot was amazing.
Overall, we would definitely stay at Tyler's place again should we need a place in Downtown Montreal in the future.","9"
"This was our first time in Montréal and the apartment location, space, and value could not have been more perfect. The space itself is cozy, clean, minimal but with with character, with a parking space nearby and a little back porch. It's in the middle of the action, near restaurants and centrally located to all the things we wanted to do in Montréal. Kitchen was well appointed. Tyler was very helpful and responsive. We will be back for sure!","9"
"Spent a lovely few days in Montreal, in Tyler's studio. The apartment was precisely as described. Clean and beautifully set. The neighbourhood was perfect for what we were looking for. Located minutes from all the shops and awesome restaurants. And quite a close reach to all the sights; Port and Plateau was a short Uber away. All in all, the perfect weekend at a lovely Studio. Thanks much, Tyler! ","9"
"Tyler did a wonderful job of accommodating our late arrival time. He got us our keys quickly, and the apartment was in wonderful condition! It looked exactly like the photos. The building was in a very trendy area within walking distance of shops, bars, restaurants and metro stops.","9"
"We had a great stay in Tyler’s apartment. The apartment is in great condition, exactly like the photos and a nice location! Supermarkets, restaurants and the subway is nearby and there is also private parking. Tyler was a great host. We would really recommend this apartment!  
","9"
"
The neighborhood was very close to everything. A lot of restaurants and shops to choose from. The metro was also a few blocks away. It was a nice central location for your stay in Montreal. Don't be fooled by the exterior of the building because it is very nice and cozy inside. There is a lot of natural light  because of the big windows.","9"
"The apartment was wonderful and just as Tyler described; clean, spacious and only minutes from major metro lines. The neighborhood has many restaurants and is close to must see sites including the museum of fine arts. Tyler himself was communicative and helpful throughout the entire process. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Montreal. ","9"
"L'hôte a répondu à toutes nos questions sans souci. L'appartement est facile d'accès, dommage pour la propreté car le logement propre aurait pu être très bien ! ","9"
"Tyler was very helpful coordinating our arrival with a friend who met us to give us the key and show us to the parking. The parking is a little misrepresented in the current listing, as it is several blocks away and during 90% of our stay, it was occupied by an unauthorized vehicle. We asked Tyler about this, and he said he couldn't do anything to make them move. There was also an air mattress available, but no pump or linens to go with it so we couldn't use it. Overall, we enjoyed staying in this area (lots of great shops and restaurants, close to the Centre Bell if you're attending an event) and the apartment is beautiful, but we had constant headaches arise from the parking situation. I'd have given a higher rating had the listing been more specific in this regard or had the situation been resolved more to our satisfaction.","9"
"The apartment was as described, clean and perfectly located.  Close to the subway and bus stops, plus rental bicycles are just outside the door.  Walking distance to Crescent street for lots of restaurants and the Fine Arts Museum. 

We stayed a week, and our small dog too.   The studio is large, with nice light. Important to us, the bed is comfortable.   Also, we appreciated the convenience of a washer and dryer.   First floor is handy, just a half flight from the street.  

We hope to come back again. ","9"
"Listing was just as described. Parking spot was just around the corner. Location is excellent- easy walk to both the green and orange metro lines. 
Loved our stay at Tyler's place! ","9"
"This is my worst Airbnb experience ever!

Tyler sent his friend to open the door for us, the apartment is dilapidated and old. When we stepped into the room, it smells like curry or some weird things. We thought it will disappear if we open the back door(no windows), but it became worse(there might be some restaurants close to the backyard). We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! 

We were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us! I tried to communicate with him but he just disappeared again!

We already reported this to Airbnb, one warning to the future guest: never trust the pictures!!","9"
"Tyler's place is perfectly located for a visit to Montreal.  Just off Rue St. Catherine and other major arteries of the city.  Parking just around the corner was short jaunt nothing to complain about.  
Communication with host and his associate Faizan was easy, swift and helpful.  
Overall a steal of a deal, good people, great location, nice place...I think a pretty solid choice.
Bed was very comfortable, bedding was also clean and comfy, linens clean and plenty.  AC worked great but we barely used it.
Supermarket around corner.","9"
"Tyler's downtown studio is a very nice getaway spot for the perfect weekend in Montreal. The studio was very clean and perfect upon check in. It's in a great location surrounded by shopping and food. The parking spot is a block away and it is a private spot so there is no worry about finding parking on the street. Tyler was very easy to communicate with and I would recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to Montreal.","9"
"Appartement typique au cœur de la rue commerçante, idéal pour découvrir la ville, faire du shopping ou aller au resto. La place de stationnement gratuite est un gros plus. Tyler s'est montré très disponible.","9"
"The location of the apartment was great , as it was close to almost everything. 
I never met the host but he arranged for his friend to be there to meet us. 

The place itself wasn't bad aside from some minor things like: the entrance of the building looked like it was under renovation but it wasn't.
The place wasn't ready to receive new guest ; the towels were put in the dryer minutes before our arrivals. 

for the price i expected the place to be better in comfort and readiness. ","9"
"Tyler is discrete. I haven't met him. I couldn't reach him by phone when I needed, but he promptly answered all my airbnb messages. That worked for me and in general his messages are friendly. The apartment is really nice and comfortable. The kitchen table and seat are beautiful. It could be a little bit cleaner (some kitchen utensils needed washing) and more organized (sink cabinet and closet were messy) but no big deal. The apartment is in the first floor of an old house and it seems it's under some renovation in the basement. So the entrance is all dusty and it may cause a not very good first impression. I hope they'll improve that soon, but overall it's a great place. Super close to metro stations, restaurants, attractions. There's a nice backyard and a small porch, however, it's not clean and the stairs are broken. If Tyler gives some love to it, I believe it'll be even nicer during summer (I was there in the beginning of fall). I would come back.","9"
"Great Location, everything nearby is accessible.
The interaction with the host went smoothly.","9"
"Perfect location and nicely kitted out - ideal base for exploring the city. Extremely comfy bed!

Basement of the building is under renovation - so it is a little messy when you enter the building but obviously not the guys' fault. Bathroom a little dated but again perfectly functional.

Couple of little issues with heating and tv reception, both of which i suspect are because of the renovation to the building. I daresay these will be resolved quickly and won't cause any future guests any probs at all - and i would certainly recommend the place to other travellers!","9"
"It looks modern and it could be a terrific apartment. Unfortunately it needs a lot of renovation, finishing touches and cleanliness. Communication is slow and last moment.

You can't reach the porch or the backyard. Apart from the apartment, the full house is in renovation. The parking is in a tiny ally and not visible. Better would be to park your car in the paid parking lot across the street.

The apartment and surroundings could be nice for young people who want to party and crash but anyone else should be able to find better places and neighbourhoods. We saw a lot of fancy places and the public transport system is excellent.
","9"
"Muy Amistoso","9"
"Très bel appartement conforme a la description de l'annonce. Également très bien situé car a 2 pas d'une station de métro et a 2 pas de la rue ste catherine et de l'eaton center. Je recommande vivement!","9"
"As to the place : 
- It was as expected and matched the pictures. It was nicely decorated and some books about Montreal were available.
- Serious heating problems.
- The oven and TV were not working.

As to the neighbourhood :
- It was central and located near shops, restaurants, bars etc.
- It was not noisy at night.

As to the host :
We had a really disappointing experience. We told him a long time in advance that our celphones were not working in North America and had thus not many ways to get in touch with him. 
We had arranged a time of arrival. We called him from a public phone to inform him that we would be a little late due to a problem with our car. He didn't answer the call and didn't react to the voicemail we left. When we arrived at the apartment, he was not there. He had left a lockbox but we didn't know the combination (he sent it to us by mail the morning of our arrival, knowing since weeks that we didn't have access to internet). We had to call him two more times in the next hour (it was raining outside) until he finally picked up (without apologizing) and told us the combination.
Later (we were staying for 5 days), we let him know that the oven and TV were not working, asking for more information, and he NEVER replied. We were thus not able to cook anything or watch TV at the apartment.

For all these reasons I wouldn't recommend this place.","9"
"The apartment was exactly as described, it was very spacious and it had great amenities, the facilities provided were high quality - and the bed was comfy! However, the apartment was very cold and the two heaters provided were inadequate for the size of the space. It was also very difficult to get in contact with Tyler which was not a great experience. ","9"
"For the price, this apartment was great.  For the traveler who values central location, decorative details, a host who is never actually around (we never met) but always a friendly text away, free parking and a comfy bed, Tyler's flat is well worth the money.
That being said, the apartment is so affordable for a reason- there were some corners cut. No central heating (had to use space heaters, which wasn't bad with the mild weather, but I can't imagine it being enough in the dead of a Montréal winter), no working oven or stovetop (one of the main reasons I airbnb instead of hotel) and a foyer and totally inaccessible backyard that are completely trashed and under construction. When I arrived, the building owner came by to do some work inside the apartment while I was unpacking and settling in. While he was only there for a few minutes, as a woman traveling alone it was a little awkward and unnerving.
None of these were dealbreakers for me- the apartment was cool, comfy and clean, and Tyler was attentive. I guess it depends on what you value.","9"
"To start out with the positives, Tyler's place was exactly as it seems in the photos. The place is very nice. There is also a TV on a wall mount so you could watch TV from the bed. Erol is very kind and was very helpful with our problems. The location was also very good. It was nice to know we had a secure parking spot.

Unfortunately, we ran into a few difficulties while staying here. First, the parking spot was relocated to a parking lot about 5 minutes away, which isn't too bad, but it drizzled one night and we didn't have umbrellas. Second, the place was slightly chilly. It is heated by two heaters that you plug in. We left the heater on while we were away and when we returned it was a good temperature. This may be due to the renovations going on in the rest of the house. Third, we ran into some power issues where the outlets on one side of the house went out, as well as the wifi. We called Erol and he had the issue fixed by the time we returned. Again, may be due to the state of the building itself. Lastly, although the apartment was clean for the most part, the couch had a bit of cat/animal hair, which got into our clothes. 

Overall, our stay was not bad. Erol/Tyler are slow with responding to messages sometimes, but they were quick to respond when we called. Thanks for the stay!","9"
"The location was good. Close to shopping, restaurants and bars. It was also great having parking available especially in the city. 

Upon entering the apartment, it had a horrendous smell of wet dog which was apparently from the guests before us. Tyler's friend who dropped off the key was very friendly and accomodating to our delayed arrival and also brought us air fresheners to help mask the incredibly unpleasant lingering dog smell and was at our disposal for any questions or needs which was nice. 

The unit overall is great for visitors wanting something basic in a buzzing location. There is no heating in the unit so we had to rely on the small portable heater, so just bare in mind during cold winter times. The Tv remote batteries didn't work and the lock on the front door was touchy. In terms of accuracy of photos, the unit had charm with the open brick walls but the decor had a rather interesting collaboration of rather dated pieces of furniture and modern additions as well. ","9"
"Perfect size and perfect location for a quick getaway in the city! Walking distance to Bell Center and not far to old Montreal. Wish we could have stayed longer and would recommend.","9"
"Overall experience was great! The space was clean, and exactly how it was advertised.  The host greeted us once we arrived and was incredibly hospitable.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in the city and not pay a fortune for a hotel.","9"
"The place is well decorated and clean. Loved the exposed brick and the hard-loft feel. Smart TV was very convenient and I generally enjoyed my stay here. My one complaint is that there is no central heating, and the room can be cold especially in the dead in the winter. Tyler was very responsive throughout and I have no complaint on that front. I would think this place is much more suitable in a warmer weather. ","9"
"Nice appartement and very well located ! 
The host is nice and there is free parking included. 
","9"
"The listing really makes the apartment look great but it isn't the reality. The place is fairly clean but is pretty rough around the edges. It's heated by place heaters and the finishes to the place are pretty non-existent. The location is great, though - great for exploring the city. It's a decent home base but not good for a couple's getaway. ","9"
"Deuxième fois que nous nous y rendons et RAS. Ce logement est très bien situé","9"
"Great place in the heart of downtown.","9"
"The place was beautiful. It looked just like it does in pictures. My only gripe was that the place isn't heated well. But they leave many extra blankets for you to use.","9"
"really nice place. He was very welcome to us. 
nice kitchen, bed :) but the house was a little bit cold and there was not enough bathroom tissues. ","9"
"Très bon appartement, bien situé, il a un très bon rapport qualité/prix. Tyler, notre hôte, a su se montrer réactif et disponible quant aux problèmes rencontrés lors du séjour. ","9"
"Bel appartement, bien situé. Très recommandable! ","9"
"Not like the pictures at all. The pictures do a nice job showing the decent parts of the apartment but they leave out the crumbling entry, broken closet doors and refrigerator full of wilting lettuce. I was a little frustrated when we first arrived and then walked outside to find a man peeing on the stairs leading up to the door (at 3:30 in the afternoon). Would not recommend; you can stay in a hotel room for $30 more a night.","9"
"We didn't get to see Tyler, but everything worked out fine. Great location, clean and calm. Nice apartment, very stylish.","9"
"If you like cozy apartments walking distance from most things, then this is the place for you!","9"
"Hôte très réactif et compréhensif qui a su rapidement résoudre  les problèmes. Ce fut globalement un bon séjour","9"
"Nous sommes arrivé à Montréal en voiture pendant la tempête de neige. Personne pour nous accueillir et des indications pas très claires pour trouver l'emplacement de parking qui était impraticable du fait de la tempête ( emplacement gratuit certes mais non déneigé ). 
L'appartement est très sympa et très bien situé, metro proche et magasins à proximité. En revanche nous avons eu la mauvaise surprise de trouver la théière avec un sachet de thé usagé dedans. ","9"
"Absolutely loved Tyler's place! His apartment is surrounded by great places to eat and easy access to shops and public transport.  The place is super comfortable and homey! We had a slight problem getting into the parking space but Tyler responded to our questions really fast and it was sorted out immediately! We'd definitely stay again in the future.","9"
"Tyler's place was great. It was clean and in a good location. Tyler was easy to get in contact with for any questions we had. The parking spot was a big plus and is very close to the apartment. I would definitly recommend this place to others!","9"
"it's such a good place. but i got a cold because there's air conditioner didn't work in the night.","9"
"Tyler's place was a great little loft perfect for a couple. Conveniently located right on St Catherine has lots of stores and restaurants nearby. Parking is a bit inconvenient due to it is a bit of a walk and also in a confusing location. Other than that it was clean and a great stay!","9"
"Tyler was acfnd awesome host.  He was very accommodating and took care to make sure we were happy and satisfied with our stay; always available for any questions or concerns we had. We would totally recommend staying here!","9"
"Reponse de Tyler super rapide et efficace... Bonne communication et accès facile aux lieux... Très bien situé si vous avez affaire au centre-ville...","9"
"This apartment is beautiful and right in the heart of shops, restaurants and public transit. Even though it was in the middle of the city, we were able to find parking directly in front most times we needed to park. The apartment is beautiful, stylishly decorated, clean, and very comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay!","9"
"Tyler was a great host! Due to unexpected circumstances, we were informed shortly before check-in that the original listed apartment was temporarily uninhabitable. Tyler worked hard to find us comparable accommodations at one of his other places. Though we weren't able to stay at the original apartment, Tyler made sure this did not affect our time in Montreal and we ended up really enjoying our stay.","9"
"Despite Tyler's friend overstaying his welcome at this apartment, Tyler quickly got us a taxi another apartment which was closer to the Place des Arts and cosier, so we had a perfect stay. He was really helpful and we settled in comfortably. The first place did look a bit like a building site as other reviews had said but that doesn't take away from it, it's a really cool and large space, would be a great place to stay - in a cool area with lots going on. Recommended: Upstairs Jazz bar close by. Thanks Tyler + Erol, have a great summer, we love Montreal!","9"
"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Staying at Tyler's place was awesome! Both Tyler and Errol were very communicative and helpful. The flat is located right around some awesome bars, restaurants, and coffee shops and we felt we were in the center on Montreal. Highly recommended!  ","9"
"My boyfriend and I had a great time at Tyler's. It was a great, modern apartment right in downtown Montreal with lots to do nearby. Tyler provided detailed instructions for our stay, and was extremely responsive and always available via text throughout our stay. ","9"
"Tyler's downtown apartment is perfect if your in town for an event in the downtown area. There are many restaurants nearby and your close to the parking spot provided. Clean, cute and comfortable space. Would stay again. ","9"
"This place is great. Location is great. The entrance seems odd at first but once you're up the stairs the place is beautiful. Enjoyed our stay and communication was easy.","9"
"Tyler is a very helpful host. The place is close to the subway and there is a variety of restaurants in the neighbourhood. It was a nice stay","9"
"Casa espaçosa e bem decorada, próxima da zona comercial. A entrada no prédio e alguns electrodomésticos eram mais antigos e a zona do jardim ainda estava a ser arranjada. O Tyler esteve sempre disponível e foi bastante simpático. Recomendamos!","9"

"Amazing location! Amazing host! Amazing apartment! Very central location with many things to do close by, the metro was very close making getting around the city seamless.","9"
"The apartment is clean and located in a good spot close to the metro, shops and restaurants. Instructions upon arrival were clear. Parking spot was easy to find and nearby despite it being on a different street than the apartment. The entrance of the apartment has a higher step to be mindful of in order to not trip. Tyler was a good communicator keeping us updated regarding the city's plan to cut the water briefly on one of the days. Overall pleasant experience staying at Tyler's.","9"
"Tyler and Errol responded efficiently and quickly to any of my questions. 
The studio was really nice and clean. Netflix was a bonus and the moveable TV ... cool !

However, I had a little difficulty with the doorknob of the appartment (round key) ... Also the door makes a creaking noise. And the bathroom door could not be closed properly.

Aside from those, my stay was great and I will come back if there is another opportunity !","9"
"Tyler was very quick with the replies and very precise with the check in. Had no problems whatsoever and I recommend this cute place to everyone.","9"
"Tyler est un excellent hôte qui répond rapidement aux messages et s'assure du confort des invités. L'appartement est vraiment bien situé dans le centre-ville, au pied du Mont-Royal.  Dépanneur, SAQ et épicerie a moins de 3 minutes de marche. Le stationnement inclus est vraiment un gros avantage et il est situé très proche de l'appartement et est sécuritaire. Rue tranquille (j'ai très bien dormi!) mais proche de l'action si vous voulez sortir au restaurant ou dans les bars. Lit très confortable et salle de bain moderne. Le style loft urbain vous met dans l'ambiance. Petite terrasse privée bien appréciée pour l'apéro. Cuisine fonctionnelle, quoique frigo relativement bruyant. Excellent réseau wifi. Somme toute, un excellent séjour chez Tyler! Je recommande fortement!:)","9"
"Nice, clean place. Walkable, everything close by. Easy to reach by car. Parking was a huge bonus.","9"
"Great hosts so friendly and easy to deal with, perfect location and really nice apartment, would stay here again.","9"
"We had a great stay! The place was nearby to everything we wanted to see. Tyler responded quickly and we didn't feel like there was anything lacking in the place. Thanks, Tyler and Errol :)","9"
"Convenient located place in the heart of Montreal. Studio apartment as in pictures, with some nice aesthetic touches, large shower, and comfy bed. Surrounding the apartment, the building itself and the patio are under construction, but otherwise the apartment was as described and it was easy to get anywhere from this location walking or via metro. Great place to stay!","9"
"Absolutely loved this space! It's much more spacious than the photos show. The space is very stylish and comfortable, with great amenities. The location is very great too, close to a lot of a good restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Tyler's place was great. The central location makes it easy to get around and the bed is comfortable. Check in was easy and Tyler was quick to respond to any questions we had. 

The Wifi was quick. The parking spot is about 300m from the front door and is a little tight but we weren't planning to use the car while in the city so it wasn't an issue.","9"
"Tyler provided clear instructions for our check-in and parking. We loved the location of this studio appartement. Just off of Ste. Carherines and 20 minute walk to the Bell Centre. The appartement was very clean.  My only complaint is that the back door should have blinds for extra privacy.","9"
"This was the best experience I've ever had with an AirBnb. Tyler's place was beautiful, spacious, and in a great location. Close to everything but still really quiet. His apartment was also impeccably clean. Not a speck of dirt or dust to be seen! Tyler was also really easy to communicate with. I can't stress how much I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a-home-away-from-home in  Montreal!","9"
"Great stay in Tyler's studio last weekend! The location is incredible-- groceries, coffee, convenience stories and the subway are all within 5 to 10 minutes of the apartment. The studio itself was a great home base for a weekend in Montreal, perfect for a couple. The row house itself, while being steps from bustling St. Catherine Street, was quiet and private, and had everything we needed. It is in an old stone house from the late 1800s-- I admire the work being put into this unique space! Thank you so much!","9"
"Tyler's place is wonderful!  He was incredibly accommodating and fast responding.  He's a heck of a host! Aside from Tyler himself, the place was beautiful and in a wonderful location so that you can get everywhere you want quickly.  I'll definitely be back!","9"
"Had to cancel my stay last minute due to a serie of events but taylor was super nice about it and understanding. Communication was excellent and everything seemed like it would of been a great stay. Recommend to anyone","9"
"Tyler was very communicative and helpful in the lead up to and during our stay. The home was easy to find, very cozy, and so comfortable for us to stay in! I would absolutely stay there again next time I go to Montreal.","9"
"Je crois qu'il y a quelques améliorations de communication à avoir. L'endroit est très bien. Il serait important de préciser que le stationnement accessible facilement est payant. Gratuit vraiment trop compliqué. Le but de ce commentaire est construction. Merci à Jason d'avoir pris le relais pour le chauffage. Ce point également est à améliorer. Nous informer très clairement comment mettre le chauffage. J'ai failli même vous demander une nuitée gratuite tellement j'ai une froid.","9"
"Great spot just a little ways down Ste. Catherine's. Very, very clean. Bed was super comfortable, pretty much had everything we would've needed. Location was good for shopping and if you're going to the Bell Centre, but sometimes we found ourselves driving to get to the really good restaurants. 

Only thing that might have marginally improved our stay was a new shower head – it was like a jet and you couldn't really move it so that it wasn't spraying you in the face. Not so great for a girl who doesn't get her hair wet every day! And maybe a set of wine glasses would be appreciated. 

Overall, highly recommend staying at Tyler's apartment. Thanks again!","9"
"The flat itself is a nice space  and is as pictured--spacious, nice design, spotlessly clean. Convenient location, very close to the Metro and downtown shopping, or if you are going to a hockey game or have meetings at Concordia or McGill. The free parking spot is a couple of blocks away, but is a great bonus. One caveat about the location: this end of downtown is still a little on the seedy side at night. Not unsafe, but not the most picturesque neighbourhood: panhandlers, guys sleeping in doorways, etc. If you're used to this kind of thing and know what to expect, it's fine. 
However, the space is in an old house that doesn't look like it's been renovated elsewhere. The biggest issue, especially for a Canadian winter, is there doesn't seem to be any central heating. Steam radiators were not working. The only heat source in the apartment was from a wall mounted fan/heat/ac unit that was too small for the square footage and did not heat the space adequately. Since there was no heat coming from the rest of the house (the stairway and vestibule are old and unheated), it was extremely cold. The bathroom was freezing. My husband likes a cooler room for sleeping but he said it was way too cold even for him. We checked out the second day and moved to a hotel. I have to say that Tyler was extremely apologetic, gave us no issues and refunded the second night immediately. Very courteously handled. He also said he would address the issue for the future--if you are planning on staying here during the colder months, I would check to see if the heat problem has been fixed.","9"
"First time using airbnb, and it was a great experience. 
Tyler was very helpful and clear with communication, there were no surprises, which is the last thing you want when travelling.
Place was clean, great location right downtown, easy to get to shops, food and transit. 
We only stayed a couple of nights, but he seemed to have all the amenities for a long stay as well. 
Would definitely go back! 
Thank you Tyler!","9"
"Tyler has a very nice place in a great location. We were happy with the check in process, the cleanliness, and with the communication in general. However, the heater was not working in the apartment and this was never resolved by the hosts so the apartment was freezing all weekend. The only consolation was that the bed was very warm.","9"
"We stayed 2 nights and 3 days during late November. 

Tyler & Erol was such great hosts! They are really open with communication. Checking in several times before check on and even after. They give instructions to the T, and that is extremely helpful for someone visiting someplace new. They are extremely flexible and accommodating. Their place is super convenient to downtown area. For our stay we left our car parked and walked everywhere. There's wifi, and Netflix available in the apartment. The heat in the apartment doesn't really ventilate through the entire place, so it was definitely cold and I would suggest bringing extra hoodies and sweats for sleeping in during the colder months. They were nice enough to provide a portable space heater in the bathroom and we ended up moving it between the bathroom ( showering & getting ready) and sleeping area (the rest of the day) a lot. This really helps warm up the sleeping area and made it more comfortable.

We had some issues with parking upon arrival (the building next door was doing construction and all the scaffolding was in the parking spot. They were super proactive and immediately took care of this issue that same day, renting us another spot at the same parking area. Thanks for that guys!

The block where the entrance of the building is, construction is going on and it blocks the entrance of the door. It's a little confusing, but everything is golden once you get into the apartment! I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area & will def recommend their place to everyone. For location, parking, and everything else, it's a great value!","9"
"This place is nice and clean but guests should be prepared to walk into a building that is undergoing extensive renovations. The main floor is totally gutted which was a bit creepy to walk into alone and at night. The flat itself is a great place to stay and hang out, there are some issues that need to be tended to like the shower head is broken and kinda useless and the back window has no curtain. Once these are dealt with I would recommend this place, the location is great only 25 min walking from the train station and super close to many great restaurants and shopping. Its also quiet at night which was great.","9"
"Right behind rue St. Catherine (lots of restaurant and bar options) and a 5 min walk to the metro station  (Guy-Concodia) it is in a great section of downtown Montreal. We drove into the city but we didn't need our car once we were situated. Beautiful renovated apartment and very clean! Highly recommend.","9"
"Tyler’s place was very clean and accurate to the listing. I would 100% stay at his apartment again.","9"
"Great space! Tyler was really easy to communicate with and extremely helpful and accommodating. The apartment is a stronesthrow to amazing restaurants. Will definitely be back!","9"
"We had an amazing stay at Tyler’s place. The interiors looks great. The way the space is widely used and decorated is amazing! Great value for the money. The parking spot is quite close and at no extra cost.

The fire alarm located right above the kitchen is quite annoying as it beeps every time we cook. I would not bother to cook with so many options for food nearby.  Tyler’s house was Center to all attractions. He was very quick with his response and a great host!","9"
"Great studio! Very well located, at the corner of the main Ste Catherine Street ( full of shops, restaurants). 5 min from the subway station.
Regarding the studio, I really appreciated the self-check in and out. The studio is well equipped.
Finally Tyler was very nice and responsive, i highly recommend his place.","9"
"Though I did not meet Tyler personally, he was very responsive and a pleasure to communicate with! Stayed for 2 nights, check in was a breeze and the apartment was very cozy. Looked exactly like the photos and is in great and lively location!","9"
"Tyler's flat is located in a prime location! So many bars and the supermarket is literally 3 minutes away on foot! The home was super warm considering the temperatures dropped below -40 at night! He even had an extra plug-in heater just in case we got chilly. The home was very clean and easy to find! Thanks Tyler!","9"
"The apartment looks exactly like it does online. Easy to find, easy to get in. Professionally cleaned between guests. Very responsive Hosts through the app, though we never saw them in person. We were there on a record breaking cold snap and the place was cozy and warm the whole time. Overall we had the best time and would totally stay there again. 

Only criticism is that the parking space shown in the picture is really 2 spaces. Make sure you park as close to the wall as possible so you don’t steal the spot of your lovely neighbor. Secondly, I wish there had been a shovel and some salt in the apartment. It snowed an abnormal amount while we were there, so maybe not a regular issue,  but we needed to dig out the parking spot a bit to get in, and the stairs leading into the building needed some love.","9"
"We could not stay at this AirBnB. The building itself was under construction, with the entrance (not pictured) smelling of mould and dust and with construction materials lying around. The apartment smelt strongly of cleaning product upon our arrival. The street was also undergoing fairly intense repairs, which I expect would cause noise during the daytime.","9"
"Tyler’s flat is conveniently located downtown. Close to a lot of restaurants and it is great that it comes with a private parking, not on the street. It looks very modern inside and it was nice a quiet.

Will definitely recommend others to book this flat and will be coming back if I am ever in town.


Thanks again.","9"
"Good location for quick trip into Montreal. Will have to come back when the sun is warm and shinning. Nice and inviting studio with good space to do some work and a kitchen to help feel at home.","9"
"The apartment was exactly as listed, if not better than expected! It was in a great area with easy access to the metro and plenty of places to eat within a few blocks. Tyler was a great, communicative host and we’d love to stay again if we ever return to Montreal. It felt like home for a few nights. We had an amazing time!","9"
"Tyler's place was everything it was advertised as! It was very comfy and had a great location, and Tyler was super responsive and accommodating to our needs. Our only complaint was construction going on right outside the apartment which was unexpected but they didn't make any noise on the weekend.","9"
"A beautiful loft located super close to everything. We were very happy to have a parking spot too! Tyler is the best, he responds quickly and gave us crystal clear instructions upon check in. Looks even better than the pics!","9"
"I had a great stay at Tyler's studio. It was clean, spacious and modern. It was also in the heart of the city so everything was just a short walk away. Tyler was also very helpful and quick to respond to messages. Overall, a fantastic experience!","9"
"Tyler was a very nice host, he made all instructions clear and was just an email away if we needed anything. The place looked like the pictures on the inside and there were no unpleasant suprises. For our purposes there was nothing lacking, although there might not be enough cooking utensils to make much more than pasta.
The parking space is about a block and a half away and a bit tough to get into. We never needed my car once though because the subway station was just as close and brought us anywhere we wanted to go.","9"
"Tyler was an amazing host, replying quickly to any questions while also checking in to make sure we had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. The apartment was exactly as described, very spacious and super clean. We couldn't have been happier with our stay.","9"
"Had an amazing stay at Tyler's place. It's a few minutes walk from downtown and plenty of restaurants to eat nearby. There was an issue with the WiFi (that was out of Tyler's hand) but he handled the situation professionally and was clear in his communications. We definitely felt welcome and would highly recommend his apartment for your stay.","9"
"I had a great stay at Tyler's place. It was extremely clean inside, had a fully stocked kitchen, a great bathroom, and it was in a part of town that had a metro a short walk away with plenty of cheap places (and expensive places too) to eat around it. While I was staying, construction was being done on the building, so there was some loud building noises going on under me during the day, but nothing to keep me up at night and most of the time I was walking around the city so it ended up not being a problem. Tyler's place itself is beautiful on the inside. The pictures are exactly what it looked like, and they gave us fresh towels and left shampoo/conditioner. The only issue I had was with the parking spot, it was incredibly close to a building and I had a hard time getting into it, as it was icy and another car had parked close. It took me and my bf around 20 mins to get into and out of the spot. We were able to work it out though, and it was nice to have parking in Montreal considering it is a packed city. Overall a great and very fun stay.","9"
"Great space and back deck! This place has everything you need for a night or extended vacation. Check in super easy, just follow the directions Tyler provides :)","9"
"Great location!","9"
"Tyler’s place was exactly as anticipated! It was very clean, had everything we needed, and in such a great location from which to explore Montreal. The temperature was chilly while we were there and the place was plenty warm the whole time! Tyler was super receptive to our needs and was a quick message away if we needed anything. We came in a car, so having access to a parking spot was great. The parking spot was a block or two away from the flat, but it was super easy to find and convenient to use. We had no complaints, only high praise for our experience staying at Tyler’s place!","9"
"Our stay couldn't have been more perfect! We were close to a lot of the places we wanted to visit in Montreal and steps away from a Metro that could take us all over the city. 

Tyler was one of the best communicators we've ever had on Airbnb and was beyond accommodating for us. The space was clean, convenient, and quiet. It really made planning our entire trip such a breeze. We were able to relax and watch Netflix late in the evening and in the morning we were able to cook with a fully equipped kitchen.

I highly recommend this place to anyone interested in visiting Montreal.","9"
"Super nice appartement with a good location! I felt like home. Easy check-in/out and fast communication with Tyler. Perfect!","9"
"A spacious flat with character! Had just what I needed for a weekend away with my partner. Loved the brick wall, and close to downtown - we walked all weekend! Enjoyed lazy mornings making French-pressed coffee to drink in bed while watching Netflix. Tyler was incredibly accommodating, easy going, and hospitable! We will be back!","9"
"The apartment was well located and Tyler offered many helpful tips for us. It was clean and comfortable.","9"
"I would highly recommend staying in Tyler’s place. The location is excellent, located on a quiet street just off the main thoroughfare of restaurants and bars and within walking distance from the city centre. The studio itself is a very cool interior, very clean and quite big! Tyler was an amazing host - great communication and provided us with some great tips of places to go and see. Also having use of Netflix was great! We would definitely come back!","9"
"Check-in and -out was easy and straight-forward with detailed instructions. Tyler replied quickly for questions. The place was neat and clean.","9"
"We loved Tyler’s place! Situated perfectly in Montreal, we were able to explore everything by either walking or public transpo. The apt was super cool, and very clean on top of it. Tyler checked in regularly to make sure everything was to our liking! Would absolutely stay here again.","9"
"Supe séjour chez Tyler !
Apparemment propre , très bien situé.","9"
"Tyler was very helpful and sent detailed instructions about the check in. The place was very clean and perfect for a weekend stay!","9"
"With Tyler’s description the check-in was super simple and the parking place was easy to find. The apartment was clean and looked just like on the pictures. We had a great and comfortable stay there. Tyler gave us some good recommendations for the city and was always very helpful. Furthermore the location of the apartment is great, since it is settled in the middle between old Montreal and the Mont-Royal, which you should visit both ;)","9"
"Tyler's house is very close to downtown, and is easy to locate. The house itself is very stylish and cozy. Tyler had left us detailed instructions on getting in, and finding our parking spot. He was also very responsive, and even offered us a chance to continue parking for the rest of the day we checked out, as we planned to still hang around town. I would definitely recommend this house for anyone wanting to explore Montreal.","9"
"L’appartement est conforme.
Les indications pour entrer correctes.
L’immeuble et la rue étaient en travaux
Tyler est attentionné même si nous ne l’avons pas rencontré. Il a été réactif suite à un petit problème rencontré et à facilité le gardiennage de nos bagages.
Bien placé pour accéder aux endroits intéressants et aux transports en communs.
Je recommande.","9"
"Great little place in near downtown. Easy access to all the good stuff Montreal has to offer either by bike or foot.","9"
"The best thing about Tyler's apartment is the location! It's right in the center of the city and within walking distance of pretty much anything you'd want to see or visit, including close proximity to a metro station. Tyler was very communicative and warm in welcoming us to Montreal. The apartment itself is kind of a gem - the street had construction going on and when we walked up to the front of the building and even into the building's foyer we weren't sure what we had gotten into, but then we opened the apartment door and all looked as shown in the photos. We recommend for future travelers.","9"
"If you're looking for a clean, affordable place to stay Tyler's place is a very good option. The location is fantastic and close to great restaurants and the Metro stafion, and the TV had Netflix. The entrance was under construction and a few details were missing (like loose door trim and sticky doors) but overall a solid stay in Montreal!","9"
"This is such a cute flat! Lots of room for 2 people. Very conveniently located in downtown Montreal. Close to a metro stop and lots of restaurants and shops. The place is very clean. Tyler is a great host and goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable. If you’re looking for a spot, definitely recommend staying here.  ","9"
"This place is ideally located in walking distance of many bars, restaurants, and stores in downtown Montreal. Tyler is a very responsive host and ready to answer any questions you may have. We had such a great time. Highly recommend!!","9"
"This was our second time staying at Tyler’s air bnb, and we wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Montreal. Super clean, great location, and Tyler is really responsive.","9"
"Tyler was a great host, he was super responsive to our messages. The apartment outside is undergoing some renovations but since we stayed during a holiday weekend there were no works so it was nice and quiet. Inside the apartment is really stylish with a lovely modern living room and bathroom. We found the apartment to be really comfortable and in a great location. The free parking a few blocks away was also a massive bonus! Thanks for a great stay!","9"
"Conforme à la description. Propre.
Tyler a été très réactif.","9"
"Pros: I have some pretty steep cleanliness standards and I can say this place was nice and clean! It was a great space to stay as a couple and I loved the preservation of original architectural details like the crownmolding and exposed brick. The shower was nice, the bed comfortable, and the TV with Netflix was great. It was conveniently  located downtown and we easily used the metro to get around. The parking spot and AC were also great to have. It had nice amenities and great touches. I'd love to stay again! We felt right at home.","9"
"Tyler's place is really great - looks a little sketchy from the street view but don't let that deter you.  Inside it is really clean, stylishly furnished and has all the amenities needed for your stay.  Check-in and Check-out was really simple with Tyler's directions and the lockbox by the door.  The parking space offered is a 5 minute walk away but not a problem to get to with Tyler's directions.  The parking space is in very tight quarters and we were a little uncertain as to whether we were in the right spot at first but we were thankful for the option because there was nowhere else close that we could have parked our car.  Tyler is a very accommodating host, giving great suggestions for things to do in Montreal while we were there as well as checking in to make sure we were doing well during our stay.  He is quick to respond to messages and we appreciated his friendliness.  His place is just off of busy Rue St. Catherine where there is lots of places to eat and shop.  It is also close proximity to the art galleries, Mont Royal, a grocery store and pharmacy.  If you want to head downtown to Old Montreal it is also pretty close (we opted to walk because it was a nice day and it took us about 40 minutes).  Thanks for a great place to stay Tyler - we will definitely stay again if we get back to Montreal any time soon!","9"
"Tylers Unterkunft hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Die Lage war ebenfalls top. Restaurants, Pubs und Supermärkte befinden sich in der direkten Umgebung. Leider ist in der Straße vorm Haus eine grössere Baustelle. Die Arbeiten gingen um 7 Uhr morgens los. Für Nachtruhe ist jedoch gesorgt.","9"
"Appartement très bien situé dans Montréal, déco très sympa et hôte très chaleureux et disponible.","9"
"Lovely apartment that is around lots of great food and not far from downtown.","9"
"A roomy but somewhat unfinished apartment. Location is good.","9"
"A spotless, spacious studio apartment with parking in the heart of Montreal. Tyler was very easy to communicate with and helpful.  We would definitely return if we come to Montreal again","9"
"Tyler was a phenomenal host; very quick to reply and ensure we had everything we needed. The parking spot was very close to the apartment, and there was a handy bike rental station one block over. Will definitely be staying again next time we are in Montreal!","9"
"This is a very trendy studio. The location, right off St. Catherines, is ideal for someone looking to be blocks away from some of the best food in Montreal.","9"
"Wonderful stay, great location! Food around the area was delicious, lots of options. Beautiful architecture. Parking is about a 3 minute walk away. Close to subway. Modern washroom. Soap, shampoo, conditioner, laundry detergent, washer and dryer are all provided. ","9"
"Super. Emplacement idéal dans le centre ville. Vraiment pratique. Je recommande. Super propre et bien organisé. En plus avec un stationnement.. !","9"
"L'appartement est super propre et idéalement situé à côté de la rue sainte Catherine (rue principale pour le shopping). Il y a tout ce qu'il faut à l'appartement et nous avions une place de parking gratuite à 2 rues (2-3min à pieds). Nous n'avons pas pu voir Tyler qui travaillait mais il était très réactif à nos messages et nous avons pu récupérer les clés dans une boîte à clés à côté de l'appartement. Allez y sans problème !","9"
"We ya da great stay!","9"
"Tyler’s place was great for a weekend stay. Perfect location. Close to the downtown core, close to Mont-Royal, and close to Atwater market. Cozy bed and a nice little kitchen to cook in. Neighbours are quiet, though there is major construction in front of the apartment; not ideal if you are visiting during the week but perfect for a weekend! Can’t wait to stay again! ","9"
"Je recommande Tyler! Très bel appartement","9"
"Tayler is a great host, all communications with him was were smooth and perfect. The apartment is also great: clean, spacious, furnished with everything you need, and in a perfect location. Highly recommended!!","9"
"We had a fantastic time at Tyler's apartment. The location is just crazy good, and that make it completely worth it. There was some construction being done in and around the building that wasn't great, but inside was just fine. ","9"
"We just loved our time in Montreal and Tyler's apartment was the perfect little home for us during our visit. It's truly in the center of downtown with easy access to everything we wanted to see. The apartment was beautiful and extremely clean. Tyler was really accommodating and willing to offer suggestions and tips for things to do while we were in town. There is quite a lot of construction going on across the street which could be a little jarring at times but it's really beyond the control of the host, just something to be aware of. Other than that, we loved our time in this gorgeous space!","9"
"The truth is, I want to live in this studio. It is very cute and comfortable. Perfect for a solo travel or a couple. Plus, it was incredibly clean, which I do appreciate it. Tyler was really good at communicating and happy to answer any questions I had both before and during my stay. The apartment is located near two metro stations and a few bus stops which made it easy to get around and explore the city. I had the best time in Montreal and I would highly recommend Tyler's place. ","9"
"Tyler's place is in a great location, right in the middle of the city. The apartment was clean and far enough off the main street so that it was quiet despite being downtown. Tyler was quick to respond and was accommodating when it came to getting me checked in. Great value for a great place.","9"
"The place was as mentioned. Though the communication with Tyler wasnt the best, he was very attentive.","9"
"Maelle a été facile à joindre.  L'appartement était propre, la chambre spacieuse et le lit très confortable.  Malgré l'emplacement près du quartier latin nous n'avons pas eu de difficulté à trouver un stationnement à proximité.  Nous y retourneront assurément ! Nous recommandons fortement. ","10"
"Cute flat, nice housemates and close to a big metro hub to get you anywhere in Montreal. Thanks guys!","10"
"Même si nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer Maëlle, elle a tout fait pour que notre séjour se passe au mieux. Elle est très attentionnée (à la fin de notre séjour, elle nous a envoyé un dernier courriel pour savoir si tout s'était bien passé et si nous étions bien rentrés). Comme prévenu, on a été très gentillement accueilli par un de ses colocataires, Gautier, qui n'a pas hésité à répondre à nos questions lors du séjour. Les autres colocataires sont également très sympa. Bref, c'est une bonne adresse remplie de personnes gentilles et accueillantes.","10"
"Ce fut un agréable séjour, on a adoré la proximité des lieux, la chambre est bien confortable et la terrasse est magnifique.
Merci beaucoup Maëlle et à bientôt","10"
"This studio is really really well located, comfortable and well equipped. I needed to spend a night away from home running around Montreal, and being on the cusp of downtown and the plateau made it easy for me to reach most places I needed to go on foot. Saint Laurent is right around the corner too. Tarek is a friendly and funny guy, and was easy to coordinate with (he actually checked me in personally at 11pm). Oh, and the bed has been replaced by a full one! Definitely would recommend this place to tourists who want a cosy space and central location.","10"
"My husband and I had a great time staying at this studio for our daughters graduation. The location is one block away from McGill Downtown campus. The host was very kind to help us find free parking right next to the house upon arrival. The facade of the house looks like a heritage site, very beautiful. The studio has all new facilities, the bathroom is large for a studio and fully renovated. Kitchen is nice, it also had some breakfast items. This place is great for a couple. The only downside is the mattress, not the most comfortable. Otherwise an A+ place and host. Would highly recommend.","10"
"We absolutely loved staying at Tarek's charming place which is just how he described it -- a cozy ground floor studio condo that is perfectly situated. We were just steps from the scenic McGill University, a short walk to the vibrants bars & restaurants on St-Laurent Street, and were conveniently able to walk to many other places during our stay. The exterior of the building is beautiful and historical looking while the interior is updated, comfortable, and super clean... all while being very peaceful and serene when we needed a break from sightseeing. 

Tarek was a superb host -- he was very kind and communicative with us from the get-go and was flexible to some logistical issues we had. He even gave us ""must-see"" and ""must-eat"" tips and overall made us feel very welcome on our first visit to Montreal. We would definitely stay here again in the future. Highly recommend!","10"
"We had a great experience staying at Tarek's apartment.  It was very clean and spacious for a studio, and the location was fantastic.  We hit quite a bit of unexpected traffic and were about an hour and a half late arriving, and he was extremely accommodating for us.  He helped us find parking, and was available for questions throughout our stay.  Check out was a bit cumbersome because of an unforeseen conflict, but Tarek was very accommodating to make it as easy as possible for us.","10"
"We had a really nice stay at Tarek's place. The room is very clean and cozy. Location is perfect too. It is close to McGill University and few minute walk from rue St Laurent. Bus stop is just around the corner too. Tarek is also an amazing host and really accommodating. Would highly recommend!","10"
"My fiancé and I arrived on a Thursday afternoon. Tarek met and welcomed us kindly. He showed us the apartment and even gave us some local restaurants and areas we should visit during our week long stay. He was an excellent host. When I reached out with a couple of questions, he responded even though he was away on vacation. The apartment is perfect for a couple looking to spend quality time together. It's cozy, clean and more than I expected for a studio apartment. I would return here without a question. Thank you Tarek!","10"
"I enjoyed my stay in this place. it is clean, neat, and we furnished. The host is very helpful and responsive. it is close to downtown and very quite.","10"
"Tarek was very helpful and flexible regarding our check in and check out.  We came an hour later than we had expected (as our train was delayed) and he was very understanding.   We were three adults staying for three nights, and although the place is set up for one or two adults, Tarek provided us with an inflatable mattress, and things worked out fine.  The place is nice, fully renovated, and very well located, in the heart of McGill Ghetto.  It's very lively with all the students setting up for the school year.  There are a lot of ammenities close by and the location is quite central.  Overall, a very nice stay.","10"
"My girlfriend and I stayed at Tarek's place for a weekend trip to Montreal. Tarek was an extremely gracious, communicative, and accommodating host. His place is clean, cozy, and very comfortable (the bed is a dream). The apartment is in a superb location: convenient to public parking garages, close to more delicious restaurants and cafes and bars than I can count, only a 20-minute walk from the Museum of Fine Arts, and just a little longer to the Old Port and Notre-Dame Basilica. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!","10"
"Everything about Tarek's place was great.  Perfect location for checking out Montreal.  He was informative about what to eat/visit/check out and I would absolutely recommend this place to others.  A nice quiet apartment, very close to St/ Laurent!","10"
"Tarek was extremely accommodating. When we arrived in Montreal, was about to rain really hard for hours upon hours -- so Tarek arranged to meet us earlier to give us the keys. He also left us some breakfast items. 

The apartment was very clean. Great location. Couldn't have been happier. ","10"
"My girlfriend and I stayed in this condo for a few nights on a holiday to Montreal, and it was exactly what we needed. The condo itself is fully self contained and in a fantastic location to explore every corner of the city. Tarek was a great host, being very accommodating for late check ins and early check outs, while also recommending some delicious restaurants. The bathroom and kitchen were both very clean in good condition. I'd definitely recommend this condo to anyone, and we will definitely look to stay here again when we next come to Montreal! ","10"
"Tarek's place is great! Great location, super clean, and Tarek was easy to reach and very accommodating. Would definitely stay again!","10"
"Very close to McGill.  A wonderful stay!","10"
"This place is very close to McGill University and also very practical to visit the city. A Great place to stay, with all you need to feel like home ! ","10"
"You'll find this place just as expected - charming, clean and in a great location. Separate side door entry is very convenient and the place itself is pretty well maintained. Tarek was easy to communicate with and a gracious host. We were very happy with our short stay here as we explored Montreal!","10"
"Great spot. Small and cozy- perfect for one person. The hostess is friendly and welcoming. I had to leave early and she was very accomodating despite having arranged to only come back to the city after I had left.","9"
"Nous nous sommes sentis les bienvenus et Marie-Amelie était très disponible en cas de besoin. L'appartement correspond tout à fait à la description et la localisation est parfaite (rue résidentielle très calme à seulement quelques pas de Ste-Catherine). Nous y retournerions sans hésiter !","9"
"This is a ground-level apartment (actually a few steps up from the street) on Rue St. Urbain. It's very spacious and newly renovated. Beds are comfortable and brand-new. Contrary to the description, there is actually a full-size washer and dryer in the apartment.

Two bedrooms are near the street and can be noisy when the windows are open. The other 2 bedrooms are in the back and are quieter. You will hear the neighbors upstairs when they walk around, but this was not a problem at night.

The neighborhood is lively and has lots of restaurants. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away. Metro stops are a 10-15 minute walk. Parc Jeanne-Mance is a block away and great for an evening picnic.

Flatbook was very responsive via phone and email (though email sometimes took several hours to be answered).","10"
"Great location.  Clean.  Comfy beds.  On street level, so be ready to close and lock windows when not at home.  One room right on a noisy street.  Two are tucked away quietly in the back.  Great kitchen, though bring everything you need for cooking.  There are no knives for cutting other than basic perforated bread knives (ie. no chef's knife or paring knife).  The space feels somewhat cold (more like a staged house than a warm home).","10"
"The host was very responsive and provided keys for all of us (4 guests). They installed an AC during the first night that helped a lot with the hot Montreal summer. The apartment was very clean, and the furniture, bathroom, and kitchen were new. It was a great value, and it has a fantastic location opposite a church and a block away from a beautiful park.","10"
"I visited Montreal and spent 3 nights here with my husband and his parents.  The flat was as pictured, setup and perfectly decorated. It was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay.  The kitchen had all of the utensils and dishes necessary to prepare meals in if wanted.  The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition.  There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately ""at home."" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!","10"
"Great stay in Montreal!  Would reccomend to others.","10"
"Sonder was a great host this place is in a great location in the Le Plateau. We ended up walking to a lot of places. The check-in process was very easy. I would recommend this place.","10"
"Our stay was great. The space was true to pictures, very modern and simple in a way that felt like a hotel! I stayed with 5 other friends, each of us was left a towel, shampoo soap etc. The kitchen was fully stocked with anything you might need! Everything was extremely clean, organized, and the size was great for 6 or even 8 guests. All in all an amazing experience. ","10"
"A great affordable place to stay.","10"
"Very clean, comfortable place in a new building. Location was s fantastic. Walking distance to the main drag in the plateau.","10"
"Beautiful place!","10"
"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Place is just as beautiful as you can see in the pictures. The house is equipped with everything you need, such as extra towels, soap, conditioner, shampoo, plates, cups, silverware, cooking utensils and coffee! The house Is located in a great neighborhood very close to restaurants and stores. The house was very clean and you can tell the host is on top of their game in making sure you walk out of their place with a wonderful experience. I will definitely book again in the future.","10"
"bel appartement","10"
"Amazing place in a great part of town. large, modern, and well laid out. quick response, self check-in was easy. it's a managed property, so not a personal touch, but professional and pleasant. only complaint is that the place is a bit loud: you can hear walking (stomping?) from upstairs, and the front room let's in all the noise from the traffic. otherwise super great!","10"
"Amazing location and value in Plateau, great for groups. Since the building is older, the floors/walls are quite thin so light sleepers should bring earplugs. Host was great and easy to communicate with.","10"
"We had a great stay at this lovely appartment in Le Plateau! Very nice and spacious, very comfy couch and a great location. Communication went well and all necessary amenities were provided. The only thing we struggled with was finding a spot for the car, but apart from that everything was great.","10"
"We were very happy with this apartment: it's very spacious and located in the heart of Le Plateau.","10"
"Where were 4 guests, and pleasantly surprised that there were also four sets of keys available! The flat has a dishwasher and a laundry machine, detergents were supplied.

Its about 30min walking for downtown (conference center), or 10 minutes by bus (bus stop just outside the house). We did not use the kitchen much, but there is a (filter) coffee machine, a big fridge, microwave and stove.","10"
"Sonder was extremely supportive and available throughout my stay. I reached out to ask some questions about the area and was helped out in just minutes. Everything was as described and super clean. 

I will be booking with Sonder again, next time I come to Montreal.","10"
"Great place in a great location. Bus stop outside the door to get you to Old Montreal in minutes. On a nice day you can walk and it was an $8 Uber. 
The host responded right away and was helpful. The parking suggested worked great and the person came in on the Holiday to open up when all the other garages were closed. 
The place was clean and had all the amenities needed. Would recommend this place.","10"
"This was an amazing find. Centrally located, this apartment was perfect for our 6 person group’s doors and drink tour of Montreal. Plenty of supplies and sparkling clean, would definitely stay here again. (Parking details were provided by host and cost about 25$ a day)","10"
"Wonderful area great place too","10"
"I would strongly recommend Maya's suite to any one whether you are by yourself, with friends, or family. It is very clean , supplies in abundance, WIFI is strong. The only thing I would suggest to Maya is to try to get in touch with client upon request. I did try even emailed her but vainly.


I had a great time. I felt like home.","8"
"Maya was very welcoming from the beginning of our stay to check out. She was very willing to help us and even called us an uber for our travels. She was very kind and made our stay very pleasurable.","8"
"The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.",""
"Yannick était en voyage donc nous avons rencontré ses colocataires. Elles sont fort sympathiques. Draps et  serviettes étaient fournies. L'appartement est propre, silencieux et bien placé. On a même eu droit à une part de gâteau de pendaison de crémaillère ! Je recommande.","9"
"the time in yannick's place was really nice. his roommates welcomed us perfectly and his room had lots of space for all our luggage. the area has a lot to offer, shops, bars and restaurants and the park is close by. we can only recommend the place.","9"
"Yannick's roommates were perfect hosts! The area was great as it was walking distance to Mont Royal with tons of coffee shops and everything you can imagine. It was also only a 5 min walk to the Mont Royal subway station so it was very easy to get around to anywhere. The apartment was exactly as described on the photos.","9"
"Le logement est super bien placé à 5/10 min du métro Mont Royal au coeur du Plateau ! Audrey et Johanna les colloques de Yannick nous ont super bien accueilli et mis à l'aise.","9"
"Nous avons fait 3 airbnb à Montréal avant d'arriver chez Yannick et nous pouvons dire qu'une chose : c'est définitivement le meilleur !","9"
"Yannick is a helpful host for local events, eateries and getting around. The apt is a classic third floor walk up in the ""Plateau"", on the rise near Mt Royal. Great location. Easy access to metro subways, buses and very walkable.  Close to restaurants and shopping. He is on a one way, quiet street. If youre driving parking can be limited or unavailable so scope the neighborhood and watch the signs! There is a Montreal parking app and Metro Transit app that are very helpful, and Yannick can help you strategize for a spot.","9"
"Yannick is a helpful, warm host, and responds to queries quickly. The location is great - walking to cafes, restaurants and shops and there is lots of character in this part of Montreal. The bed is comfortable and the apartment is tasteful and interesting. Highly recommend.","9"
"Shane welcomed us in with open arms, he was very friendly and helpful. Stayed up to chat with us, suggested some places for us, and worked very hard to be sure we were having a good stay. First thing he did when we walked in the door was offer us food. Cozy, affordable, and pretty close to a lot of cool stuff.","9"
"Le gars est brillant! Et l'appart tout autant;  on s'y sent, immmmédiatement comme chez soi. ""Hautement recommandé"", si on veut non seulement dormir quelque part, mais rencontrer quelqu'un.

The guy is brilliant, and the house too. Feel immediatly at home. Highly recommended. Opportunity to sleep somewhere and to meet a human being. Thank you Shane!","9"
"Shane was a GREAT host.  When my father and I arrived, there was a lack of bed space for the two of us and Shane voluntarily gave up his bed so that we could be comfortable.  He went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay.  I felt safe and secure and was able to live according to my odd schedule and hours without any problems !","9"
"Nice, Nice, Nice. European and artistic but well organized and covenient house. Perfect location. A block away from great street filled with international restraunts and grocery stores. While you arw enjoying the scene, you will get to the Metro or Bixie bikes. I did write this because of Shane. He is a kind and good guy. He will give you a full support while you are staying his place. So have a nice time!!","9"
"Shane was a a great host. He is very accommodating, communicative and fluent in both French and English. I never felt I was intruding in his space and I felt at ease sharing his kitchen and bathroom. His place is situated in a quiet neighborhood that is safe, charming and short commute to downtown. It is a short walk from his place to restaurants, bars and shopping (produce and clothing). I highly recommend this listing.","9"
"Shane was very helpful and amenable with check in time. The apartment is very clean, spacious and centrally located to food and drink. We loved our time in Montreal and Shane was very helpful!","9"
"Shane was an AWESOME host! I couldn't have asked for anything better; the place was cozy, close enough to everything I needed (I did have a Bixi membership for the month though which was also great), and I felt perfectly comfortable and safe. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone :)","9"
"Un grand merci à Shane pour sa disponibilité et sa fiabilité ! Logement très bien situé et agréable.","9"
"Great location!  Unit was just as described.","10"
"The host was very responsive from checkin through to checkout. He waited for us to give us the keys and show us around though our train was two hours late. The place is as described new, modern, extremely clean. The building that the unit is small and quiet despite being extremely well situated. Would love to stay here again.","10"
"Andy was very accommodating . He took the time to walk us around the neighborhood and get us acclimated. The loft was perfect and the location was extremely convenient. Everything we needed and expected.","10"
"Wonderful, clean and modern apartment in a perfect location. Really appreciated the communication and flexibility with A when our plane was delayed and then rescheduled multiple times. ","10"
"Vous pouvez y aller sans hésitation, c'est bien comme décrit dans la présentation et le quartier est idéal pour visiter Montréal.
Certes l'appartement n'est pas très lumineux, mais il est rare d'être en centre ville avec une vue imprenable sur la campagne! Et puis on n'y est surtout la nuit...","10"
"The loft was immaculate! The decor was lovely as well. It felt ""good"" - comfortable and safe the moment I walked in. I appreciated the security lock at the entrance to the building and the elevator. The location was awesome, just meters from the Basilica as promised. Also only a few short blocks to a metro stop to get to the 747 Bus to the airport.","10"
"I loved my stay in Montreal!! The air bnb was perfect for my short 3 night stay and I felt very comfortable there, it was definitely clean and tidy and had everything that I needed for my stay. I would most certainly use this air bnb again if I visited again. Many Thanks","10"
"Great place, great location, and Andrew was very helpful and easy to communicate with.  It's steps from Notre Dame cathedral, and was a convenient place to be: in Old Montreal/Ville-Marie, but also right by the Place d'Armes metro station, Chinatown, and the bus to Mile End/Quartier des Spectacles. We found it very peaceful and relaxing, and great for an afternoon nap after a long walk!

The apartment was clean, quiet, open, and airy, there was free wifi and Netflix, and basic kitchen amenities, including a coffee maker. We enjoyed getting some bread, fruit, and veggies from Marché Jean-Talon and having them for breakfast. 

I would gladly stay here again, so I guess that's the best recommendation!","10"
"The host was great.Friendly,easy to communicate with.  Great location","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"I did not have firm arrival time and Andrew worked with me to make sure the key was exchanged without a problem. I wanted a downtown location and it was seconds away from the Basillica Notre Dame.  The loft was spacious, clean, modern, comfort  and attractive decor, with a well equipped kitchen, plenty of closet space and large bath area with shower/bath combined and a working air conditioner that I appreciated because there were some very warm days.   I did not meet Andrew  but all my questions were answered promptly.","10"
"The description was accurate and met our needs.","10"
"Great little studio in the heart of Old Town - super convenient and steps from the Notre-Dame Basilica. The apartment has everything you need and is impeccably clean. 

Only slight downside for us was the communication style - not quite as welcoming and flexible as we've become accustomed to with Air BnB hosts. More of a serviced apartment experience rather than a true Air BnB but comfortable and positive overall none the less. Thank you! ","10"
"Great place in an excellent location. Highly recommended.","10"
"Great location in the heart of old Montreal.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 112 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Andy’s space was located in the most amazing location in Montreal. Walking distance to anything and so many options for shopping, food, patios, etc. The space is so cute and trendy just as described. They offer so many amenities in the kitchenette and bathroom so you don’t have to run out for the little things you might need. Very quiet inside the space. Check in involved walking to a nearby location to get the key from a lockbox but was manageable. Thx again !","10"
"Nice apartment in a great location.  However, this apartment is in a building that does not allow short term rentals.  We were not told beforehand.  There is a warning on the front door that you do so at your own risk.  Also, the owners were not very responsive to our concerns regarding the smoke alarm beeping regularly while we were there (it was never fixed for the full week we were there), and that there were no pillowcases for the extra pillows.  ","10"
"Perfect location for St Catherine’s and the Plateau. The apartment was in a great location and felt very safe with security door to main entrance. My wife and I loved our stay. Would highly recommend this appartment.","10"
"Olga and Andrei's place was very stylish, in a great neighbourhood, and easily accessible.  Contrary to what people are saying about the key location, it was very easy to find and a 3 minute walk from the condo.
Cons: There is a sign on the front door prohibiting short term rentals (AirBnBs), the pillows were flat as a pancake (there were extras in the closet but no pillowcases to go with them), a dishcloth and/or a hand towel would have been appreciated. 
Pros: The place was super quiet, in a lovely area, the bed was comfy, and we very much enjoyed our stay.","10"
"The hosts are really kind and I had no complications. Also the appartment was clean and did not lack anything.","10"
"The location of this apartment was so perfect.  We loved being right in the heart of Old Montreal with easy access to so much.  The apartment itself was also just what we wanted and needed—clean, cozy, quiet, modern and with most everything we needed.  Keep in mind when booking that parking is not included and will run you about $20 a day.  Andy made self check-in very straight forward.  We gave it four instead of five stars because there were signs in the lobby saying that Airbnb was forbidden, and we worried about being kicked out.  We never had a problem though.  If they had been granted an exception, it would have been helpful to know that.","10"
"Yves was an amazingly helpful, organized and very welcoming host. He had left some food and refreshments for us and made sure we felt free to use his kitchen appliances and TV to make our stay comfortable. The central location made it easy to move around and enjoy the city. Yves' condo was exactly the same as shown in pictures.","10"
"I enjoyed my stay in Yves's house. This cozy place is very close to downtown. So, it's very convenient to go everywhere by Metro or bike if you wants to visit this beautiful city. The host is very sweet and nice, he is always accommodating to your needs. Bedrooms and bathroom are very clean;  shampoo, body wash, towels, etc. were all provided! Overall, great experience and I would highly recommend staying here.","10"
"Yves was a great host very welcoming, his place was great and described accurately as read online ","10"
"Yves place was exactly like the pictures, beautiful, perfect location and we felt right at home. Although we did not meet Yves, Michel, Yves friend was really nice and welcoming, communication was very easy ","10"
"Yves is a very accommodating host. We arrived later than we had expected due to some unforeseen bus troubles and Yves was very understanding about the whole ordeal. 
He was also extremely helpful, he provided recommendations for the best ways to get around the city, and informed us about free Bixi bike day. 
His condo was very clean, and he provided all of the accommodations we would ever need. 
He was also great at getting back to me right away - my messages were always answered within a few hours, and he answered all of my questions! 
I would highly recommend Yves' condo if you're planning to stay in this part of Montreal. It's a great location - it's so easy to get around the city with this condo as your home base! ","10"
"Highly recommend this listing for a perfect place to stay in Montreal. The place is even better in reality than the pictures if you can believe it. Stayed with two other friends for a long weekend and had plenty of space to feel comfortable - honestly it was hard to leave sometimes, the place was so beautiful. Convenient location to get around Montreal and great neighborhood.

Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Yves, but he was the perfect host regardless. We had everything we could possibly need but he was still very communicative and friendly about making ourselves at home in his place. 

Overall would definitely stay here again - and probably will since I visit Montreal often!!","10"
"I just returned from five nights in Yves' apartment, and I can't say enough great things about my experience. The space is spectacular: bright, beautifully decorated, modern yet comfortable, and spotless. The sunken living room is an awesome place to hang out, the bedrooms are spacious, the outdoor area is a great place to relax with a cup of coffee in the morning under the trees. The apartment is in a fantastic neighborhood that has a real French flavor. It's within walking distance to many of Montreal's attractions, and a short metro ride to others. And Yves himself is the consummate host. He was friendly and gracious, was very flexible with our schedule, and checked in on us several times to make sure that we had everything we needed. This is a true Airbnb winner and I can't wait to return!","10"
"We had a five star experience during our two nights Yves' condo  at. The apartment is bright, beautiful and spacious. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and the metro is a short walk so it is very convenient. Yves was out of town when we arrived but he had someone meet us at the apartment to show us around. He was flexible to accommodate our late arrival. We came for the Montreal marathon, but I would like to come back, stay in Yves' apartment again and explore this beautiful city.","10"

"Bon accueil de Stéphanie, très arrangeante pour l'entrée dans le logement. Jolie chambre bien localisée,  belles serviettes fournies. Attention au lit (assez mou, à ressorts), et aux toilettes (communes à la salle de bain dans une coloc de 5 avec nous il faut bien viser pour y accéder) ; mais le prix étant très bas on ne veut pas se plaindre ! :)","9"
"Très bon quartier, et très bon accueil !!","9"
"The was exactly how I imagined it. Stephanie was really accommodating and respectful of my quietness. Can't beat the price and location combo everything is within 2min in every direction. Also a good coffee shop right underneath the apartment is so convenient. Only wish I had access to the balcony but that's just me. Overall perfect!","9"
"It was a very nice and warm stay. Alexia gave me detailed instruction in advance of my arrival. Denis welcomed me with a lot of information on the region. The location is very convenient pretty close to the River with a quite park and beautiful view. Room is cozy, clean with a lovely bookcase and quite a few French books to choose from. Overall a great stay. Alexia was so nice to arrange a pick up as I left the phone charger in the room. Really lovely hosts highly recommend!!","10"
"Alexia and Denis were very helpful from the beginning. Their house is located close to Verdun Metro and Wellington street so, eateries and shops are very close. The waterfront is about 4 blocks away and you can have a relaxing walk every evening. I wish I could have socialized more with Alexia and Denis. The stay was wonderful and I would recommend their place to my friends.","10"
"Alexia & Denis are awesome !  They made our Montreal trip very enjoyable. Denis gave all the travel information we need when we arrived. This location is very close to the subway station and BIXI, so we did not have to drive the car and had no trouble to get around the city. Highly recommended ~ ","10"
"Great hosts who were very accommodating and kept in touch. Nice apartment with on street parking and great local shops.","10"
"Very nice hosts. Denis gave us plenty of recommendations not only for our stay at their place but for our trip. The two rooms are spacious and beds quite comfortable. thanks for hosting us!","10"
"Dennis met us outside  when we arrived. He and his wife were very helpful in telling us the best places to eat, check out and visit, and also in helping us find our way around. They even got us a metro map to help us maneuver the city.  They provided toiletries and also allowed us to do a load of laundry even though that wasn't in the description.  The apartment was very clean  and comfortable. The apartment is about a half mile from the nearest subway station but the walk is very beautiful and filled with delicious restaurants and cafés. A must stay. ","10"
"Very nice host! Thank you! We had a great time in your place.","10"
"Denis was very kind and helpful with everything! He made us feel right at home, and helped make us an itinerary for our stay in Montreal. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, and the house was about 10 blocks away from the metro station. ","10"
"Alexia et Denis nous ont très bien accueilli. La chambre correspond bien aux photos et le quartier est sympa. Denis nous a bien conseillé pour la suite de notre séjour. Une adresse que je recommande.","10"
"Alexia et Denis sont très accueillant, nous avons passé une très bonne soirée! Merci à vous!
Je recommande! ","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 60 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"A spotless apartment, and you barely know the hosts are there. There is only one bathroom, which we all shared. But there was never any issue.","10"
"It was my 3rd time staying at Alexia&Denis' place and they're not only hosts but truly good friends that you want to make. They're friendly and you'll never get bored when u have a conversation with them. They provide lots of suggestions and advice if you don't know where to go. The bedroom is nice and clean and backyard is awesome. We had a great supper time with A&D in their backyard and we made BBQ! The apartment is located near the water and park is beautiful. The area is quiet and neighborhood is pretty nice. It's 10 mins away from Metro(subway) by feet and we didn't have any hard time traveling around downtown by taking the train. I can't wait to see them again next time!","10"
"L'appartement est dans un quartier verdoyant et tres reposant. Les 2 chambres sont grandes et les lits confortables.  Alexia nous a accueilli et nous a fait sentir tres a l'aise chez elle. Elle a été tres accomodante pour l'heure d'arrivée et de départ et nous a même aidé à trouver un endroit pour imprimer nos billets. Je recommande!","10"
"Alexia and Denis were very accommodating and easygoing hosts - I really could not have asked for better representatives of Montreal! We had gone into the city not really knowing what to do, and Denis sat with us for a good 15 minutes describing in detail some of his favorite places and the best times to go. Both Alexia and Denis were fluent in English and French, and we would engage in lively discussions on anything from politics to vegetarian recipes to Mario Kart (be warned: Alexia is prepared to defend her championship title on the last one!) On the flip side, they are also perfectly fine giving you space whenever you wish to rest or simply avoid social interaction.
As for the listing itself, parking was readily available on the street and the location was an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station. Bathroom and bedrooms were clean, and the wifi connection was good. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood with no traffic noise, and there are no pets in case any guests might have allergies. I will definitely be recommending this listing to any friends or family visiting Montreal!","10"
"Loved the stay ! Will definitely recommend this place. The hosts are extremely friendly. They guided us to local favorites. Will visit them again !","10"
"Great value; Denis was a very helpful host! Exactly what you need for a short getaway.","10"
"Nice location. Good cafe nearby  called st.lo. bagels. Keep in mind check-in for first say around 6pm. Stay the next day then out by 9am the next  day.  That's two days accommodation which I thought was a bit inconvenient. Beds are fairly hard futon style. My travel buddy got very little sleep in other room. Host helpful with places of interest. Has recently installed new shower. Woken up by noisy traffic both days as close to busy road. Honest review . Nice hosts but probably look for something more comfortable next time. If you're looking for something on a budget this would be a good option.","10"
"Nice and quiet place!  Alexia and Denis are very friendly. We stay for one night.","10"
"Great place to stay","10"
"Séjour très agréable chez Alexia et Denis. Les chambres sont spacieuses et propres, tout comme l'appartement qui est également bien équipé.
Nos hôtes étaient disponibles pour nous donner des conseils même si nous ne les avons pas beaucoup vus car ils travaillaient beaucoup. Du coup, nous avions l'appartement pour nous la plupart du temps.

L'appartement se situe à 10-15 min de la station de métro Verdun mais il y a un arrêt de bus pratiquement au pied de l'immeuble pour s'y rendre.

Le quartier est calme et on y trouve tout ce qu'il faut pour se restaurer ou faire des courses.

Merci encore pour votre accueil à tous les 2! Au plaisir !","10"
"Denis and Alexia were very hospitable while I, my wife, and two kids stayed with them. Nice location, close to metro station. Recommended!","10"
"Alexia and Denis were great hosts. It was seamless experience finding the place, parking out front and getting settled in. They were very friendly and happy to help suggest things to do while we were on vacation. Would stay here again next time!","10"
"Very nice and friendly couple! Their place is very welcoming.","10"
"Alexia and Denis were gracious hosts and we'd definitely stay with them again!","10"
"Alexia and Denis were wonderful hosts and extremely helpful with the metro, things to do, and general information. There home was very clean, neat, and a great choice for our stay. Would book with them in the future, highly recommend!","10"
"Nous avons eu un super accueil et de bons conseils et suggestions pour notre séjour. Alexia & Denis ont été très sympas et pas du tout compliqués. On s'est sentis très à l'aise! Quartier tranquille et très bien situé. Merci!","10"
"Alexia and Denis were great hosts. Good communication before arrival. They are extremely helpful with a lot of information. The house was very clean and neat. Highly recommended and definitely to stay there again.","10"
"Alexia et Denis nous ont beaucoup attendus, nous venions de loin en voiture et avions pris du retard. Ils se sont montrés d'une gentillesse rare et très accommodants. Un seul petit détail, le lit dans lequel nous avons dormi était un peu dur pour nous, je conseillerais à des adultes de dormir dans la chambre au paysage grec où, d'après notre fils, le lit était confortable. Les enfants s'accommoderaient plus facilement d'un lit plus dur. Sinon, l'appart est très agréable et bien situé très près du fleuve et de jolis parcs. Nous recommandons chaudement ces hôtes.","10"
"Unser Aufenthalt bei Alexia und Denis war sehr gut und wir haben uns wohlgefühlt. Beide sind sehr nett, aufgeschlossen und hilfsbereit. Die Wohnung liegt ca 10 Minuten zu Fuß von der Metro entfernt, die einen in 10-15 Minuten zum Zentrum bringt. Es ist sehr ruhig, man kann problemlos auf der Straße vor dem Haus parken. Immer gerne wieder!","10"
"It was my 4th time being accommodated by Alexia and Denis(*2nd time visiting with my boyfriend). Amazing couple who you really want to get to know about and have a deep conversation with. They provided useful information about what’s going on in the city. Check in and check out are flexible. Their apartment is close to the Metro station and neighborhood is quiet. We had a fun, relaxing and enjoyable during the long weekend. Looking forward to my visit again next time! Congratulations on your wedding~ Bon voyage ❤️","10"
"Super séjour chez Denis et Alexia ! Très accueillants et souriants, ils savent vous mettre à l'aise et sont disponibles dès que nous avons besoin d'aide ou de conseils. Nous nous sommes sentis un peu comme chez nous. L'appartement et les chambres sont spacieux et très propres, il y a tout ce qu'il faut pour passer un bon séjour. Le métro vert est à 10 min à pieds (trajet d'environ 10 min jusqu'à l'hypercentre de Montréal), et des stations de Bixi à proximité de l'appartement. Le quartier de Verdun est très mignon, et ne manquez pas la rue Wellington et la baignade dans le fleuve du Saint-Laurent à proximité ;). ","10"
"Denis was very nice. We found the place easily under Denis's instructions. During the stay, I enjoyed several free talks with Denis. It is surprising to find he is an engineer and has the same background as us.","10"
"Great hosts, fantastic communication. Only thing missing was AC or a fan so the room got very hot with no air flow when it was over 90 during the day. No fault of the host, but perhaps a fan would be good. Very friendly and kind hosts who helped when we had a flat tire and offered to help find a shop to fix it. Would recommend if you need a close place to everything and kind people to chat with! ","10"
"My first time using air b&b and also first time in Montreal; Alexia and Denis made it a great experience. They have a very clean apartment and are close to the Metro. The recommendations and map were appreciated! Thanks very much :)","10"
"Great hosts!","10"
"Nice quiet neighbourhood, parking available on street (better practice your parallel parking skills!), nice big rooms, clean and incredibly accommodating hosts. Me and two teammates stayed over a weekend and barely saw the hosts until the last day we were packing, but they were always a quick message away. Loved staying here.","10"
"Our stay with Alexia and Denis was better than expected. We interacted with Denis for the most and he was super friendly and always ready to give any advice on what to visit and where to go (the breakfast advice was awesome). Also, our group of four was super impressed with how clean the house was. five star","10"
"It was a good stay. We liked how quiet the neighbourhood was, and good location to everything.","10"

Room is marvelous, new and mordern decoration, except there's a little bit decoration odour.","9"

"Awesome apartment in the heart of the city. Close to everything. Would definitely stay again !","9"

"Great apartment great location","9"
"Great spot!","9"
"I stayed in this listing w/ a colleague on a business trip. It was perfect and the area is really nice too. Communication w/ Sonder is so incredibly fast and easy. Entry was via keypad so check-in was super easy.","9"
"Superbe appartement dans le centre-ville!","9"
"I really recommend this rental which was beyon expectations, well located and very clean and tidy.","9"
"Nice place!","9"
"We can't say enough great things about this host . Any question or concern we had he responded within minutes . The unit was clean and looked like the photos that were posted & all the details about the location were accurate . We would highly recommend this unit and host to anyone considering visiting downtown Montreal .","9"
"This apartment was very nice and we really enjoyed our stay. It looks like the pictures and was very quiet, though nearby to restaurants and shopping in the downtown area as well as Mont Royal. The kitchen had all the standard amenities. They provided shampoo/soap/conditioner and towels as well. I would stay in this apartment again. There were only 2 of us but it is large enough to hold a couple more people (though only has 1 bathroom).

Two things to note: as stated in the description, the building is currently under construction. It was very loud for 2 days of the trip but we didn't hear it at all on the 3rd day. Keep that in mind if you choose to book while the construction continues. Second, Sonder requires you to register on their website (with name, email address, and phone number) in order to rent an apartment from them.","9"
"The highlight of this place is its location. Easy to access shops, the metro, restaurants, etc. The amenities are good. The kitchen, dinning area, and living room have basic furniture that will work for most travelers. The beds are a little stiff but there are worse places to lay your head. The bedroom with the ball lamps on the side table is very bright while the other bedroom is wonderfully dark. Temperature control is challenging since the only AC unit is in the dining area. Water temp fluctuates without adjusting the nozzle/valve, but that's probably building-wide. During our stay there was construction on our balcony so we woke up each morning to those sounds. We were instructed not to open the windows to avoid dust coming in. On the morning of checkout the next client came in at 7 AM. That was awkward. In summary, it's a nice place but this wouldn't be my first choice for the next visit to MTL. ","9"
"Beautiful apartment, super clean, easy instructions. I really recommend this apartment! ","9"
"This is a great spot in downtown Montreal! Close to all the downtown attractions including night life, restaurants, etc. Issues included being a little dusty when we got there also a little too far from the closest supermarket. What you see is what you get. The communication between guest and host was fantastic. Another problem was the fact that while we were there one of the neighbors had construction so we had a lot of noise  early in the morning which deteriorated our sleep. Overall we had a great stay.","9"
"They were awesome! The place was amazing, the sonder team were always super accessible and helpful :) ","9"
"Clean, modern, central, convenient, quiet, safe.","9"
"Can't beat the location.  Easy working with Sonder.","9"

"Great location, clean, very beautiful, walkable to all locations. No AC in the bedrooms but they have plug in fans. One AC unit in the common area is available.","9"
"Great location and great price. Issues stem from checkin instructions not coming to us in a timely manner. Also there were a lot of flies in the apartment","9"
"Overall good place, but parking isn’t free on weekends as mentioned. Great space, clean overall, although we did find some stains on the bedsheet. Great space overall. ","9"
"Tessa and her boyfriend were wonderful hosts. They helped us find our way around, provided us with some much needed coffee in the morning and were friendly and accomodating. The location was great, one stop from Le Plateau and four from Berri-UQAM. Would definitely stay here again! :) Thanks guys!","10"
"Tessa et son compagnon sont très sympa, malgré la petite infortune du à une incompréhension sur la petite annonce,
Ils ont un appartement sympa et parfaitement propre et si vous êtes seul leur chambre est idéal.
Merci d'avoir accepté de nous rembourser la 2eme nuit.","10"
"I had a great stay here. Trevor and Tessa are a lovely couple and were a great help when finding my feet in the city. The apartment is in a fantastic location, close to restaurants and shops. I would definitely recommend this place to bagel lovers! :)","10"
"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay (3 nights) with Tessa and Trevor. Although we did not see too much of them, when we did they were both extremely friendly and always ready to help with directions or recommendations for places to eat at or stores to visit. Their apartment is clean and cute and the neighbourhood they are in is quiet and felt really safe to walk around late at night. Mile End is a great neighbourhood - lots of interesting cafés, bakeries, two renowned bagel places, vintage stores, bars, lots of bixi bike rental stations and bike lanes. We would both definitely return in a heartbeat.","10"
"Tessa and Trevor were very friendly hosts. Bedroom was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again!","10"
"We enjoyed our stay!
The room is in a great neighborhood, where it is pretty and safe;
The apartment is very pretty and clean, the living room and porch really make a difference;
The room is good, I wish the room is quieter and the bed is bigger though. (not in a bad way, Tessa told me ahead it is a twin size bed. it is perfect for one person,not two. It was not a big deal though; The room is next to a big road so I could hear trucks and cars during asleep) 
In general, the room is really cool. It is my first time using airbnb. I really loved it. It is way better than any hotel. I felt at room and Trevor helped us to get to know the real local stuff. I will book it again. Thanks again Tessa &Trevor! ","10"
"Tessa and Trevor were both really nice hosts. They were friendly and happy to help whenever I had questions. The place has so much character and is in a great spot! It's so close to everything and Mile End is such a cool area. I would recommend staying here while you're in Montreal.","10"
"Tessa was a great host. The room and apartment were tastefully decorated and located in a perfect location for exploring Mile end  and Plateau Area. Everything was super easy and hassle free. Thanks again Tessa, Matt.","10"

"Tessa and Trevor were great hosts. Helpful, made us feel welcome, provided us with linens and towels. I definitely recommend!","10"
"This room with it's perfect location in lovely Mile End is highly recommendable. Both Tessa and her boyfriend are both friendly, helpful and easy going. I felt both welcome and at the same time like i had my own private space within the house.
I really enjoyed my stay, and hope to come back again some day.

"I had a nice stay at Tessa's place! Tessa and Trevor are kind people and gave good recommendations.

The location is great, a lot of awesome restaurants and music venues in the neighborhood. Also quite close to the park and easy access to other parts of Montreal.

The room has a comfortable chair and desk that's great for when you want to get some work done at home. And there is a laundry room with washer and dryer which proved to be convenient.

The only issue was that it was quite cold (especially at night), and we weren't able to get heating. Tessa did provide extra blankets but sadly didn't do much to keep me warm. I'm sure they'll get the heating fixed (as Montreal can get super cold), so shouldn't be an issue for others.","10"
"Great room in a great neighborhood, plus a cute cat. Tessa and Trevor were kind and accommodating. They helped us figure out the best places to go in Mile End, which was very appreciated. We have already recommended their apartment to our friends, and you should stay there too! ","10"
"Tessa was an excellent host—her place is wonderfully decorated, comfortable enough for two, and in the best neighborhood I could ask for when visiting Montreal. Checking in was as smooth as could be. She left a super-helpful list of places to visit that perfectly suited my interests. Plus, her cat is adorable.","10"
"I stayed with Tessa and Trevor for three nights. They were very welcoming and easy going. They helped me with planning my visit, giving me heaps of advice and directions. Mile End, was great! The flat is in an awesome location and was very comfortable. Plus, the cat was very cute!
I would highly recommend the room.","10"
"We stayed at Tessas and Trevors apartment for 6 nights. Room was comfortable and apartment was beautiful, nicely decorated. She/he has definately eye for visual details!! We used room mostly for sleeping and for us it was more than sufficient. Location was perfect; bus stop is right next to apartment and it was easy to travel in Montreal. Also there was some nice restaurants and shops and Tessa gave us also helpful list of things that are nearby. Tessa gave us 100% of her help if we had any questions. ","10"
"Tessa and her boyfriend were great hosts- the room was just what we needed for a getaway. It was private and in an amazing location! Thanks again Tessa and Trevor for your kindness- would highly reccomend them to friends!","10"
"Tessa and Trevor were welcoming and friendly.  Their place was warm,  clean and inviting.  They provided great recommendations on things to do in the Mile End area,  which was left for us in the room making it easy to take with us and explore the area with.  Their home was close to the bus stop and close to many great restaurants and small shops.  The bed was comfy and the room had a nice steady breeze,  making our summer nights comfortable. Would stay again and recommend!","10"
"Tessa was a nice host, she was kind and gave us a paper with some places of interest around the area. I dont have any objections, nice house, nice area and nice city.","10"
"Tessa was a great host! Communication was super easy so we didn't have to worry about anything upon arrival. Tessa was extremely understanding when my dog in all her dog clumsiness broke a lampshade, waving it off like it was no big thing (much appreciated!). 

Parking was a little annoying, there are a lot of restrictions, so if you have a car, make sure to read all the posted signs carefully! The area was super cute, Tessa's place was very centrally located and walkable to just about anywhere we wanted to go in Mile End. ","10"
"Très bon séjour dans le coin à la mode de Montréal.
Bus pour aller au downtown juste à côté et direct. Pistes cyclables partout dans le quartier. De nombreuses installations sportives aussi.
L'appartement comporte 5 pièces et un balcon bien agréable au fond.

"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a great first experience. Tessa and Trevor were excellent hosts! Communication was super easy and they even stayed up late to wait for us. They were welcoming and friendly from the moment we arrived; they even provided us with a list of all their recommendations in the area. The room and apartment were also exactly as pictured, Tessa really has a great eye for decorating. If you love animals, I would also recommend this place because they have an adorable and super friendly cat named Navy. As for the neighborhood, the Mile End area is really cool− it has a bunch of great restaurants and bars. Transportation was very convenient, as well. There is a bus that leaves from the corner and the Rosemont metro station is also super convenient and easy to get to. I will definitely be recommending this place to all of my friends! :) ","10"

"I spent a weekend at Tessa's home with my girlfriend. We were within walking distance of everything that we wanted to see and she gave us great suggestions for restaurants and bars nearby. The room is exactly like the pictures and we enjoyed the company of her extremely friendly cat Navy. Parking in Montreal is confusing so make sure you read the signs to figure out where you are allowed to park.  We would definitely recommend staying here; we loved it!","10"
"Excellent Airbnb experience! The room was cozy and very pleasant. Tessa welcomed us and provided toiletries, towels, and a very helpful list of restaurants in the area.  Mile End is a great location, and is convenient (15 min walk) to the metro.  And the cat is very friendly!","10"
"Tessa was a fantastic host - very welcoming and accommodating. We appreciated the thoughtful touches in the room as well: a list of nearby restaurants, travel toiletries, etc. We'd be happy to stay with her again!","10"

The bed is super comfortable: an easy place to crash after a day in the city. Tessa also has lots of great neighborhood recommendations (thank you SO much for that!) and their cat is adorable. This was the perfect place for me to stay during my trip to Montreal!

They were also super accommodating when I was running late getting to their place when I first got to town--I was having navigation issues and some traffic holding me up, but they were really understanding about it.

I would love to stay with them again! Thanks, Tessa!!!","10"

The location was beautiful and near so many nice places to eat, grocery stores etc. There was a bus stop practically right outside. The room is beautifully decorated, but if you have a lot of luggage it might be a bit small (there is no closet). Tessa and Trev were great hosts, and were happy to have a chat or leave me to my own devices if I needed space. Would highly recommend!","10"
"Es war ein fantastisches Erlebnis in Karines Haus in Montreal. Wir haben uns wie zu Hause gefühlt. Die Kommunikation mit Karine verlief sehr gut und unkompliziert. Sie hat vor und während des Aufenthaltes per email nachgefragt, ob alles in Ordnung ist und weitere Tips für unseren Aufenthalt gegeben. Schon im Vorwege hatte sie gefragt, was wir gerne machen würden und uns dazu Tips gegeben, wo wir am besten einkaufen und ausgehen können und eine Liste bereit gestellt, wie alles funktioniert und wo alles zu finden ist. Die Beschreibung des Hauses  ist absolut realistisch und die Umgebung, das Plateau Mont Royal ist die neue trendische Wohn und Lebensgegend in Montreal. Wir haben mit als Familie mit 4 erwachsenen Kindern dort eine sehr schöne Woche verbracht, viel zu Fuss unternommen, Croissants beim besten Bäcker der Stadt um die Ecke gekauft und die erwachsenen Kinder in einer der angesagtesten Bars um die Ecke mit Montrealer freunden gefeiert. Obwohl so zentral gelegen, ist das Haus absolut ruhig gelegen und kein Strassengeräusch zu hören.  Bei Ankunft stand Bier und Milch für den Kaffee ein Kühlschrank und eine Tüte Kaffee für die Espressomaschine bereit. Wir können Karine und ihr Haus nur absolut empfehlen. ","10"
"Our group of 3 adults and 3 children(aged 8-15) stayed for 5 nights.  With the eclectic decor and fully equipped kitchen we felt like we were staying at our friends home.  Karine offered helpful suggestions for the neighbourhood and was quick to respond with more information when asked.
The grocery is right around the corner.  Some of the cities best coffee shops, restaurants and shopping are all in close walking distance.  The metro was also close enough that we had no problem making multiple trips to and from each day, as we opted to not have a car for our trip.  
The home worked great for our family.  Two rooms with single beds accommodated my children ages perfectly.  and master was spacious.  All bedrooms had fans which we put to good use as the home does not have a/c and we were staying though a heat wave.  The backyard oasis was perfect for winding down after our days activities and our daughter loved her private backyard balcony and hammock.  The home also had plenty of other fun diversions for the kids to play with.  We very much enjoyed our stay.  
Thank you Karine and Family!","10"
"Vous allez vivre la véritable expérience Airbnb ! Karine partage sa maison familiale, et c'est comme si on était chaleureusement accueilli dans sa famille  ! Nous avons particulièrement apprécié de pouvoir passer toutes nos soirées dans le jardin, et profiter des températures plus que chaudes de cet été ! Les espaces sont spacieux et on ne sent pas à l'étroit. Le jardin et la maison étant très ombragés, malgré la canicule, la température est restée vivable ! Les nombreux ventilateurs disponibles ont fait leur job !
La cuisine est suffisamment équipée pour faire la cuisine pour 6, et le lave vaisselle est alors grandement apprécié :)
Merci à Karine et sa famille d'avoir partagé avec nous leur demeure !","10"

"This was the best stay I've had so far on Airbnb. The apartment is located on one of the cutest and most accessible streets of Montreal, and the pictures are very accurate. The apartment is spacious, clean, and a great value! Sebastian was helpful and accommodating to my early arrival, and was very easy to get in touch with regarding our check-out. I will definitely book this Airbnb again and I highly recommend it to others! ","10"
"Nous avons passé une excellente semaine. L'appartement de Sebastien est idéalement situé pour visiter Montreal. Le métro et les bus sont à proximité. La rue et les quartiers sont très vivants et il y a tout ce qu'il faut. L'appartement est très bien équipé et nous n'avons manqué de rien. Sebastien a été tres disponible pour répondre à nos questions et extrêmement réactif.","10"
"We spent a great night between girls at the apartment . The owner was very helpful and was concerned about our comfort. He made us a ""small tour"" of the apartment and gave us clean sheet, linens, everything we needed . The place well located , close to everything. It costed us 10$ to take a cab from the old Port.   We would definetly go back . Thank you :)","10"
"Très bel appartement bien situé. Sebastien était très disponible pour répondre à nos questions. L'appartement est bien équipé pour cuisinier et rien à dire sur la propreté : top !
Pour résumer, très bon rapport qualité prix pour un logement à Montréal.","10"
"The apartment was great. We couldn't have asked for a better place at this price.  The location was perfect as it was walking distance from many iconic places.  Bars, parks, clubs, places to eat, and the metro were all easy to walk to.  Sebastién made check in and check out very easy for us. His hospitality was amazing and the apartment was very accommodating for our group. Montreal was beautiful and if we were to come back, our hope would be to stay at this apartment again. The place was comfortable, clean, and overall a relaxing place to stay for a visit to Montreal.","10"
"L'appartement de Sébastien est très bien situé, rue très sympas, toutes les commodités à coté.
Il est également très bien situé pour aller visiter le centre de Montréal.
L’appartement est très spacieux et avec tout le confort nécessaire,  climatisation, la cuisine très bien équipée avec tous les ustensiles nécessaires.
Appartement très propre et bien rangé
Sébastien s'est montré très disponible et pas besoin de lui poser des questions car il a pensé a tout.
Je recommande vivement l'appartement de Sébastien
Merci encore pour ton hospitalité.
","10"
"This apartment was perfect! The location was great and the apartment itself was so beautiful. Easily fits 6 people. Sebastien was quick to answer. I would most definitely stay here again.","10"
"Sebastien was A1 out of the gate. Throughout the booking and arriving phase Sebastian communicated clearly and effectively. He was very helpful when we needed suggestions for parking. The unit was in spotless condition and was better than the photos. He even has a handy tour guide booklet printed off for guests. The location was prime for exploring downtown Montreal. It was just a 3-4 minute was from the Metro. 

Unfortunately our visit was tainted by a burglary. The backdoor appears to have been unlocked. We didn't use the door and were unaware of its existence until departing the residence. Sebastien is sure that it was left locked. We had left around 3 pm and returned around 3 Am after attending Kanye West at the Bell center and going out on the town. During the break and enter my personal laptop was stolen and a closet door was destroyed. The police came and there was little they could do without the tracking software installed on my laptop. I do believe Sebastien is a great host and has a great spot, but I was very unimpressed with his handling of the event. He had little to no concern about the loss of my possessions and even tried to charge us 400$ for the damages to his closet. Airbnb costumer service throughout this process was useless and made settling back into things at home quite stressful. This experience has caused me to consider traditional methods of lodging for future trips. Although, I think this was an unfortunate coincidence it certainly put a damper on our trip. ","10"

"My guest and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Herve's condo. Herve communicated well before our stay and was very accommodating with scheduling our arrival and departure times. He was also very responsive to any questions we sent him via text. Upon arrival, Herve provided a tour of the building, its amenities (gym, spa) and the condo itself. The condo is exactly as seen in the photos, new and clean, and felt welcoming. The location was also great - directly across from a large park, while close to the metro, which made it easy for us to explore Montreal.  ","9"
"I had a great stay at Herve's condo. I travelled with my 4 year old. Herve's son (Jean) met us with the keys and gave us a tour. The location is perfect with Jarry park just across the street. The condo is quite modern and extremely clean. There was even shampoo, conditioner and soap laid out in the bathroom - just like in hotels. The shower stall was so lovely. Everything was beautiful I can't emphasize it enough. Communication was easy. Herve was available by phone at all times if I needed anything. Thank you Herve and Jean! ","9"
"Everything was perfect, we loved our stay to Herve's condo. Herve was on time for the mettings and he answered fast to our questions before our stay. The condo itself was awesome, brand new and clean. I strongly recommand to everybody. ","9"
"Très bel appartement conforme aux photos. Très bien situé, près du Parc Jary, à proximité des stations de métro et de l'incontournable Marché Jean Talon. Nous y reviendrons et Hervé est vraiment sympathique.","9"
"Herve's condo is beautiful. Well decorated and very comfortable for anyone looking to have a clean, private, comfortable place to stay in Montreal. We absolutely loved the location, walking from Jean Talon Market back to the condo was so convenient. There are some great cafe's near by and good transit access. Herve was a great host, very accommodating to our schedule, providing us with maps of the area and great suggestions. Herve and his son Anthony were very friendly. I would definitely recommend staying at this spot!","9"

"This was a great listing and an amazing place to stay. Sofia's place is clean, well decorated and just the right amount of space for 2-4 people. The space felt cozy and we loved it. We were only a bit disappointed that we found out at the last minute that there was no AC (as listed) but Sofia was very understanding and compensated us based on our experience. 

Sofia herself is a great host who is very attentive right from the first moment we wanted the place. She kept in touch by email and text and even checked in with us daily. The instructions she left were clear and she was available to help when we needed anything. The neighbourhood was nice and quiet as well. 

I would definitely stay at this listing again!","10"
"Sofia's place was exactly as advertised. It was really clean and her directions were very clear. Sofia kept in contact with us to make sure everything was ok. Her restaurant recommendations were good as well. I would definitely stay at Sofia's place again. I really liked her condo and the neighborhood. The building was very quiet and we enjoyed staying there. 

Thanks again for everything Sofia! ","10"
"The apartment is great, clean, modern, easy to find, and with all the amenities we needed","10"
"We had a beautiful stay. The pictures represent the apartment perfectly. Sofia is a sweetheart and was a pleasure to deal with. The apartment is conveniently located near the highway & the metro. Will definitely try to stay here next time we're in town!","10"
"Un logement parfait. Très propre et très  tranquille. On se  sent comme chez soi. On retournera, si les dates sont disponibles. Le contact avec Sofia a été facile. ","10"
"Place was exactly as advertised. Just outside downtown Montreal and a quick drive into the heart of it. Owner was more than helpful, was available to answer any questions we had for the entirety of our trip. Would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for somewhere close to downtown without paying downtown prices.","10"
"Good","10"
"Honestly, this is one of the best airbnb experiences I've had so far! Sofia's place is really close to public transit, and she lives in a nice quiet neighbourhood. Although I didn't get to meet her, she made sure everything was ready and easy for us. Check-in was a breeze. I'd definitely try to stay here again whenever I plan another trip to montreal!","10"
"Tres beau sejour","10"
"Clean place, good owner. :)
Spacious apartment.","10"
"Sofia has a cozy apartment in a quiet place in Montreal. It is perfect to relax, and it is very easy to go downtown or other places from there. the kitchen is complete, the washing and drying machines are very modern and efficient. We had a wonderful time in Montreal, and hope to get back soon!","10"
"My mom and I loved staying at Sofia's place during our trip to Montreal. Her place was clean, quiet, and well equipped for a very comfortable stay. Parking behind the building was so convenient. My mom had to work from home for a couple of days, and the living room made a great home office as well. Definite recommend for a peaceful retreat in Montreal that's still reasonably close to downtown. ","10"
"Die im obersten Geschoss gelegene Unterkunft hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Sie war mit allen Annehmlichkeiten einschließlich einer Vielzahl von Lebensmitteln ausgestattet. Parkmöglichkeit besteht hinter dem Haus. Die Wohnung ist über ein Treppenhaus erreichbar. Für den ersten und letzten Zugang muss die Außentreppe benutzt werden. Zur nächsten Metrostation sind es 7-8 Minuten (Preis für Hin- und Rückfahrt 6 Dollar pro Person).","10"
"I had an amazing experience, Sofia directions was very clear and precise. 

Thank you ","10"
"We had a great stay at Sofia's place! Photos are accurate. One private parking spot behind the apartment was very convenient.  It's one the third floor with no elevate, which was no problem for us. 

There is no air conditioning, but in the middle of June with the window cracked open and the fan on, it wasn't a real issue.

It's about a 10 minute walk to the subway, depending how fast you walk. We took the subway every day and  got very used to the walk. There aren't many things to do in the area, but with the subway so close, it didn't really matter to us.

At first glance, the neighborhood appeared a little sketchy and run-down, but we never had an issue. It's a very quiet neighborhood with quiet residents who seem to keep to themselves. And the interior of the apartment is very welcoming and well furnished.

All in all, we had a great time and would stay again! Montreal is a beautiful, relaxed city and I recommend it!","10"
"Sofia's place is money worth for it's value. Although it's not located in a very good neighbourhood but this is the place where close to downtown and easy access to any where. Sofia is a good host, she prepare her place like a home for family traveler and give very clear instruction and everything are accurate. ","10"

"100% recommended","10"
"The appartement is really lovely. There is enough space for 3 to 4 people and it offers everything you need. The parking lot behind the Building is an advantage. With Uber it took 10 minutes to get downtown. We would stay there again.","10"
"Very clean and cute place! Comfortable and felt like home! I would recommend!","10"
"Sofia's place was clean, tidy and looks just like it did in the photos! She made it easy to check in and out and parking on site was convenient. Location was great too!","10"

"I had a great stay at Sofia’s. Didn’t run into any issues.","10"
"It was my first time coming to Montreal and Sofia was a great host. She was very responsive and helpful. Her condo is really clean and there are plenty of street parking. She also has a parking spot in the back but I did not use it because it is easier to park in the street. One minor complaint that I did have is that you can smell cigarette in the bathroom. It is probably from the neighbors smoking. I did let her know and hopefully this issue can be addressed in the future. We just left the bathroom vent on and it seem to help. The location is decent and about 10-15 minutes from Downtown. Overall I had a great stay and would recommend it.","10"
"Sofia’s place was great! Easy to get to with easy access to downtown Montreal. All parts of our stay were convenient and easy. The ad is accurate and Sofia is a great host!","10"
"Excellent accueil dans un petit quartier calme et sympathique. Merci Sofia !","10"
"Sofia’s place is very nice , it is a lovely home and had everything we needed for our stay, everything looks like the pictures and everything listed was there, the location is not bad and only 20 mins away from downtown Montreal whiteout traffic, I didn’t find any restaurants in walking distance but there is many close by in a car. There is two cornerstones conveniently on each block near her place , which was nice. We just had to be careful because there is a lot of personal things that belong to the host in the home so we tried to be as respectful of her things. A lot of person touches to the home. 
If you can’t take the stairs than that would be the only issue other than that everything was great. I would recommend this for people needing a quiet place to stay not to far from everything","10"
"Sofia is a wonderful host who have put the time into ensuring visitors have clear instructions on how to get to her location, as well as clear check in and check out procedures. The home itself was very tidy and spacious, with a gorgeous kitchen and balcony. For those travelling with a vehicle, it is a great location -- within a quick drive to downtown, and she had a parking spot available. I would highly recommend this space for folks with access to a car or are comfortable using public transit to get around. Thanks, Sofia!","10"
"Great, clean place. Close to downtown. Exactly as described. Great communication with Sofia. Thanks!","10"
"Good all around place to stay in Montreal.","10"
"Clean, quiet, comfortable and near the metro. It was just right for 3 of us, and Sofia was easy to reach.","10"
"Great space, everything you need in a roomy, well located apartment. For older people be aware there is no elevator so it is a little tricky getting to the top floor. 

Would definitely rent again, Sofia was very helpful and her place is so well equipped.","10"
"Great place and location.","10"
"The best in MONTREAL!! Sofia’s home will give you everything you need! This was my first Air BNB booking and I am so impressed. 

Sofia is really a professional and AMAZING host!

Thanks Sofia :)","10"

"Great place to stay lots of mirrors which is always nice. Short/cheap cab rides to the port or downtown for $11-16. I would stay with Sofia again!","10"
"Sophia's apartment was amazing, beautiful and spacious. Clean and very comfortable beds. Sophia made sure we got in safely by texting me and made sure we had everything and that she could be contacted if we needed anything.

Thanks Sophia, we would stay here again.","10"
"Sofia’s place is modern, comfortable, and in a great location. Can’t beat it, especially for the price.","10"
"Well located in quiet neighborhood. Walking distance to Atwater Market (20 minutes) and to Chez Nick in Westmount (20 minutes from market). Quick response from Sofia made our stay even better. Try ""Entre Ciel et Terre"" (8 min walk) for quaint dinner...food is excellent! Highly recommend Sofia's place.","10"
"We had a very nice stay! Sofia was responsive to all messages and everything went smoothly with no issues what so ever. Very close to downtown as well. Greatly recommend!","10"
"Nice place!","10"
"Très bel accueil, décor chaleureux et bonne description des environs. Je recommande.","10"
"Wonderful apartment. Super close to the metro. Only thing i would mention is to be aware the apartment is up three flights of stairs, which could possibly cause issues especially with bags. Otherwise, we had a lovely stay & would come back in a heartbeat.","10"
"Excellent place in Montreal! Our lockbox was frozen shut at check in, but Sofia answered and helped us out right away so we could get in! The space is very stylish, clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend her place :)","10"

La literie était confortable.
Je recommande cette adresse.","10"
"Sofia’s place is a great choice. Comfy bed, stylish apartment, good location! Sofia is quick to respond to all questions and was very helpful with check in and local suggestions.","10"
"Sophia is the definition of a SUPER HOST .. great communiction.  Her home is stylist and sparkling clean with plenty of amenities.  Location is amazing especially if you have a car (parking avail. on premises); you can drive anywhere in greater Montreal in less than 20mins although the abundant construction in the city may delay you a few mins.  Special thanks for the late check out.  cheers :-)
keep in mind, you have to climb up 2 stories(there's no elevator) thus it's not ideal for the elderly or physically handicap.  
We will definitely try and book her place again when we're back in town!","10"
"Great location, close proximity to city. Parking provided, close to metro.  Fast wifi, quick responses. Highly recommend!","10"

"This place was an amazing find! We were in awe from the moment we walked into the apartment! Location was fantastic, all the amenities and the service we received from flatbook throughout our stay was top notch! 

We were aware that there was no AC but when we arrived we were so happy to see a small unit set up for us! It was a pleasant surprise and they had many fans for us to use as well. 

All the guests had a wonderful experience, 5 stars!!","8"

"Very nice stay!","8"
"Great place.   Super spacious and well equipped. In a great neighborhood.","8"
"We had a great stay in the Sonder flat. It was perfectly located for us in the center of nightlife, great food and bars. As a large group of 6 the flat was a nice size and we slept very well at night. The only drawbacks for us was the lack of kitchen staples (most rental homes include ample sugar, salt, olive oil bottles, etc) and some issues with electricity (the only way to turn on bedroom lights was via turning on the living room light as well and there was lacking useable sockets in the bedrooms). Otherwise, we had a great time and would definitely return with larger groups again.","8"
"Awesome area for going out with a lot of cool small restaurants","8"
"Great location, coffee across the street and pretty much anything else you need was walking distance. Furniture and floors were cheap, some parts of the floor were broken. The apartment overall was quite sterile and dark.  Not super cozy but served its purpose as a place to sleep and shower. ","8"
"An amazing place to stay in Montreal! It was a clean, and stylish apartment that offered some great amenities.  However, the best part of the whole apartment is its location. We were close to so many great restaurants, and activities. This apartment is an easy recommendation.","8"
"Amazing location, and great value for a spot in montreal ","8"
"The apartment is big, well located, near good restaurants in Le Plateau. Some parts of the floor were broken and the floor of the kitchen and bathroom were sticking. We asked for an extra cleaning and the concierge in a few minutes answered our message, but unfortunately, even with an extra cleaning the floor was sticking yet. The best part of the apartment is the location.","8"
"AMAZING LOCATION. Clean and stylish space. Super fun - best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at.","8"
"Great location, comfortable amenities, but what you don’t see (or hear) in the add are: music from the downstairs retail store, noise from the upstairs renters, one bedroom with no windows, outlets, or ventilation, a TV with no cable or antenna access, and street noise. It’s a great rental if you plan to be out and about in Montreal. ","8"
"This is a great place to rent in the heart of the night life. My friends and I really enjoyed the location and the space was beautiful. It looks even bigger in person than the photos! Thanks for the stay! Would totally stay here again","8"

"Great location, right off of St. Laurent. Lots of great restaurants nearby. Very cool loft apartment with lots of space. 2nd bed is a futon, could have used an extra blanket or sheet for it.
Apartment was nice and clean. Ben was great and met us to show us around when we arrived, and to help park.","9"
"Ben nous a accueillit sur place et très bien expliquer les commodités du condo. Emplacement au cœur de Montréal. Pres du boul. St-Laurent. Super.","9"
"Je reserve mes appréciations pour plus tard","9"
"Great modern apartment with a super cool shower. Location is right off Saint Laurent, super close to a Saq, Cafe Campus, Shwartz Deli. Conenient to every where only a couple of blocks from the Sherbrooke Metro, great place.","9"
"The hosts are very warm and communicative. The location is really great, very close to downtown, McGill, old port and other POIs. The apartment was nice and modern and had good amenities. The only problem is that the second bed is on the loft on the top of the other bed, which means that there is no privacy at all. It has a very short ceiling so its only good for sleep. And, the AC and ceiling fans do not reach the loft so it was always hot.","9"
"Large space, clean and tidy. Comfy large sofa, supermarket and bars close by.","9"
"Ben was a wonderful and accommodating host. We thoroughly
Enjoyed our stay in the loft. Everything was perfect for our two night stay in Montreal. La Plateau is a vibrant and fun neighborhood and I can't imagine staying anywhere else in the city.  The apartment is so comfortable and relaxing. I especially
Loved the oversized bathtub and waterfall style shower.
Ben was very easy to communicate with and was kind enough to check in with us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. He was able to provide great restaurant recommendations and beyond. Thank you Ben ! :)

If you are looking for a fun and comfortable place to stay in Montreal,
Look no further. It exceeded all of our expectations.

"Très bon accueil de la part de Ben dans son condo très bien situé. (Nous avons tout fait à pieds) les photos correspondent bien au descriptif et cerise sur le gâteau la super terrasse sur le toit!","9"
"Our stay in Montreal was nothing short of ideal. The space is exactly as advertised, if not better. The open layout was perfect for hosting three friends and I. We made great use of each and every amenity, including the rooftop patio, which provides a great view of the surrounding neighborhoods and skyline. The condo is located in the heart of the action and finding something to do was never an issue. What impressed us more than the condo itself was Ben's willingness to make our stay as memorable as possible. Ben ensured that we knew of all the best places to eat and which events to attend for the true Montreal experience. ","9"
"What you see is what you get! The place looked exactly as it did in the pics. Very clean, modern,  fully stocked with everything you need and more right down to board games, books and movies. Ben was very accomadating and even offered to pick us up from the airport but we were driving. He had the place ready on time and took us on a walk through to make sure we were good instead of just handing us the keys and splitting. This was my first AirBnb experience and after this one I will be using Airbnb again for sure.

Thanks Ben and Airbnb!! ","9"
"Bens place was very spacious and modern and had all the amenities we could want. Both Ben and his wife were super lovely and accommodated us with an early checkin at the last minute and had great communication. Ben and his wife even greeted us with fresh bagels and schmear from the famous fairmont bagel shop and croissants.  Their communication was great and the place was a great deal for the area. It is super close to a lot of bars, restaurants, and shops and walkable to the metro which was about 10min and close to many buses. Even though it was a hip and somewhat loud area on the weekend being off one of the side streets was very nice and quiet for a good night of rest. One thing to note is that you will need to use the set of keys to lock the door so going in and out requires the keys. It took some coordination but in the end it worked out. His entertainment set up is also amazing for when you want to curl up and watch on of their diverse library of DVDs  with surround sound. All in all I would stay again and Ben was a good host for our first time in Montreal. ","9"
"Ben was super helpful across the board. We met to get the keys, and then he was available via text for the duration of our stay.  We was also very helpful after we'd left, when we realized that we'd left some luggage accidentally outside on the sidewalk. He did everything he possibly could to help us get it back.  We really appreciate him going the extra mile. ","9"
"Ben's place was awesome! We loved the space and it had everything we needed. The only issue we had was our car was too big for the underground carpark, as the roof was super low, so we had to find street parking.","9"
"All was great! The appt. was beautiful and walking distance from most places we went over our stay. 
Ben was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed on our stay!
Thanks again, Ben!","9"
"Great condo in a fantastic location, close to plenty of shops and restaurants. Walking distance of downtown. The pictures are very accurate so we knew what to expect on arrival. We were able to park the car on the street, although an underground garage was available if we needed it. Ben was a very helpful and friendly guy. We had a good stay at Ben's place and were very comfortable there.","9"

"I had a great time at Chris' place! He doesn't live there himself, but welcomed me and made sure everything was alright. He is the nicest, gave me tips for the city and prepared a little care package for me. The apartment is alright, a student flat in a great neighborhood, very close to downtown Montreal. I'd definitively come back!","10"

Will definitely stay here next time we are in time. ","9"
"Super easy check-in/check-out process. Great spot and location, very clean, everything necessary for a good stay.","9"
"The Sondra group replied to any questions I had promptly and thoroughly.  The apt had all the amenities you could want, great wifi, and great suggestions for what to do and see in Montreal.  
The location was perfect as it was in walking distance to Old Montreal, downtown and Rue St Dennis.
They even left a nice gift for my birthday in the apt for when I arrived!  I highly recommend them for your stay in Montreal!

"Lovely condo that looks true to the photos and is in excellent condition. Kitchen was well appointed with the basic things we needed. Beds are a bit noisy and bedding is nice to look at but cheap quality so not very comfortable. Note that it is a great, central location though is on a somewhat seedier block of Ste. Catherine so you will see homeless people hanging around the church across the street from the condo often. We didn't have any issues though. As well, the smoke detector was off the wall and not working when we arrived, but I received a prompt reply via email from Sonder with an offer to fix it ASAP. Overall a good place to stay in downtown Montreal.","9"

"We enjoyed our stay in Sonder's place. The check in was easy and the apartment is really well located to get around the city. You can walk both to the Plateau area and the Old Town. 

The apartment also had everything we needed for our stay and we where able to eat some evenings at home when we did not have the energy to go out. One of the beds squeaked quite a bit so if you are a light sleeper it could be a bit hard. I would recommend a stay at the apartment.","9"
"Incredibly inflexible and unhelpful. Had to cancel a trip due to an illness. Very much understand no refund being made available as it was a last minute change. That being said, I did not expect to be charged cleaning fees for an unused apartment that had been cleaned prior to our arrival.

"Great location close to everything! Only a few short blocks to the Just For Laughs festival and Place des Arts. Walking distance to the entertainment area of Rue Saint-Denis, Old Montreal and numerous other attractions.
Condo was new, very bright, very clean and modern in a secure building. Easy access instructions. Easy and great communication with the folks at Sonder. 
Hope to stay here again someday.","9"

"Our host was great with making arrangements simple and convenient. Wonderful neighbourhood, easily accessible to bars, restaurants and subway but also quiet and quaint. We really enjoyed sitting outside in the shared space with a beer or tea. ","9"
"Pamela's place was just what we wanted. Quiet neighborhood, GREAT location in Mile End. Quaint backyard, comfortable bed and clean bathroom. Our host was communicative and left the key in an easy to find spot for us. There is some non-resident parking right in front of the house- perfect! There is also a lovely little futball field behind the back yard where there is always someone (kids/adults alike) playing a game. Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, bars and locally owned boutiques within walking distance. Perfect!","9"
"Centrally located apartment in a really nice, lively area of Montreal. Very welcoming host. Isabelle was SO thoughtful. She offered a disposable kitty litter and catnip for my cat, who quite enjoyed the stay too! 

The room (and apartment) was SUPER clean and came with everything from a bathrobe to shampoos and soaps to even - and this one impressed me a lot - a PRAYER MAT. For people who need one to pray! I had NEVER seen anywhere think of providing so simple and obvious an amenity before, not even expensive hotels. It shows a level of empathy that she continued to demonstrate during the whole 10 days I stayed with her. 

She's a good conversationalist and also very capable of resolving conflict calmly, which is good since there are bound to be toes stepped on when two strangers decide to live together for several days. 

All in all, despite some minor awkwardness, I'd say that I had a nice stay and would recommend Isabelle's company and hospitality to anyone wanting to find low-price high-class accommodations in Montreal for a brief time. ","10"
"the host: Isabelle is a fantastic host. She is direct, easy going and fun with a great  sense of humor ( to the extent of comprehending and appreciating mine. lol). It was easy to communicate with her and we had some interesting exchanges. A brilliant conversationalist who have an interesting opinion on the surrounding world.
the place: The room has all the basic amenities, you could dream of with a great balcony to enjoy, if the host agreed to share with you. Although small, but this is a known fact, it's perfect for the solo traveller.
the neighborhood : I've lived in Montreal for quite a while now and still puzzled by the mile-end. I called it the little Paris, for the amount of french living in the neighborhood, but not only. The place is charming and the small cafes and pizzerias definetely gives you a taste of Europe.","10"
"Isabelle welcomed me,  and I felt like she had been my good friend for a long time by the time I left!   Isabelle went out of her way to find a parking spot,  made sure my stay was lovely and comfortable.  She is a fabulous chef, and a wonderful company.   I truly enjoyed my stay.","10"
"Le mauvais temps m'a forcée à avancer mon arrivée et Isabelle était disponible pour me recevoir un peu plus tôt que prévu. Un voisin faisait du bruit et elle est allée lui demander de baisser le son. Bref, elle a su rendre confortable mon séjour et je l'en remercie.","10"
"Great place, great hostess, great value.","10"
"The Host made us feel very welcome , we were six of us. Everything was clean and spacious and the neighbourhood  was right in downtown with all the amenities and resturants. Although it rained we still had a good time. ","9"
"The apartment was lovely and in a fantastic location in Montreal. 

Just as described. 

Kenny was welcoming and helpful. He made our stay very pleasant and accommodated our arrival and departure times. ","9"
"We had the most wonderful experience at Kenny's spot! It's in an awesome location central in the Plateau and a quick 10-15 min drive or cab into downtown.

It is cute, clean and he leaves you towels and other nice additions that really make you feel comfortable! 

The property is set up through an entry code so no key exchange makes everything so seamless and efficient.

We will definitely come back to stay here again!","9"
"Although we didn't meet our host in person he communicated with us via text and promptly replied to any of our exchanges. We arrived in the evening and the lights and airconditioning were on for our comfort. Fresh flowers were on the table and the apartment was clean and stocked with all necessary supplies. The apartment was spacious enough for our family of six. Great location, close to shops, clubs, and restaurants. We would definitely come again.","9"
"L'appartement est très bien situé, sur le plateau du Mont-Royal, tout près des resto et des commerces.
Kenny était très prévenant et a tout fait pour que notre séjour se passe bien.

Nous recommandons vivement.","9"
"Very nice place with three proper bedrooms and a sofa, kitchen and living room. There were four of us and we were perfectly comfortable. In a great central location, easy walk or short drive from many Montreal destinations. Kenny was very accessible. Thank you!","9"
"It's my first time in Airbnb, overall it is a nice house!
","9"
"Kenny's Airbnb was very spacious and unique. Everything was clean and the location (Plateau) was really good. Close to many bars and restaurants without the noise and crowds of the downtown core of Montreal (which can be reached by foot in 20 - 30 mins or easily via subway)

Check in / check out was convenient using a keycode. The apartment had a dishwasher, AC unit, a washer, and dryer. There's also a TV box with Netflix, a nice added touch.

Provided free parking in the back of the house was VERY helpful. Finding parking in Montreal can be a huge headache.

I would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Cute place that sleeps 3 singles comfortably (although we were only two). Loved the quirky decor. There was coffee, sugar cubes and a French press which was nice. No hair dryer though, so ladies - bring your own. :)","9"
"Très bien organisé
Rue cependant un peu bruyante","9"
"Very big space. The photos didn't do it justice. Has everything you need. Great location. Car space is a bit awkward.","9"
"Our experience with Kenny was wonderful.  Kenny was very quick to respond and helped us find an extra parking space for our U-Haul trailer which we had with us as we were moving our son into his apartment for the school year.  

The location is perfect, the apartment is large and I especially enjoyed sipping my coffee on the back balcony! Also, the free parking was fantastic for a small/regular sized vehicle. Parking may be too tight for a large SUV. The keyless entry was convenient, and the ac was welcome as it happened to be a hot and muggy couple of days.  Finally, we asked what we should do upon leaving and Kenny quickly wrote back ""don't do a thing"" and ""good luck"" to our son. It was a nice, personal touch.","9"
"It was great staying at the heart of Rue St Denis, just 2 blocks from the Metro. Having a parking space is an added bonus.  Airconditioning was great. Kenny was so thoughtful; she left bottles of water for us, which was a nice treat during the hot streak. The terrace was a nice treat. This is an awesome place for a family.","9"
"This property has a great location and unlike most in the area has a private (albeit small) parking spot in the rear alley. 
It has two terraces, one over busy St Denis, the other overlooks the backyard.
The parking spot is a bit hard to get in and out of. My full size car fit but I had to have my travel partner guide me when leaving the spot. 
Coffee and bottled water were on hand and a nice touch.
The Metro station is very close.
I think it would be tight getting 6 people to fit comfortably. One bed is pretty small, 5 would be more accurate.
The free WiFi was fast and reliable.
Host was very responsive with emails arranging how to access the apartment.","9"
"Great place to stay!  Very clean and was in a great convenient location near all the bars and restaurants and a metro station.  It was very quiet, so you don't hear anything from the outside.  I would definitely stay again and recommend it to future Montreal travelers!  ","9"
"We had a great experience for our first time  at an Airbnb.  We really enjoyed our stay, and the location was wonderful.  The rooms clean, and the place had a cozy feel to it.  We would definately repeat.","9"
"terrific place in Montreal.  great location.  clean and comfortable.","9"
"Kenny's apartment is a great place to stay in Montreal. Like others have said, it's in the heart of great neighborhood, Plateau Mont Royal, and right around the corner from a metro station. There are multiple great bars and restaurants (including a bistro called Cafe Cherrier and the famous L'Express) within just a few minutes' walk.

We were a group of four and the apartment fit us very comfortably. The rooms are spaced pretty far apart for privacy, which was an added bonus. The bathroom is large and the water pressure in the shower was excellent (it's a pet peeve of mine when pressure is low!).

Kenny was extremely responsive -- he answered a bunch of my emails before the trip and a couple I had while we were staying at the apartment, most of them nearly immediately. 

I would definitely stay here again!","9"

"Kenny's Place was very clean, what we expected and she even let us come back when we forgot our trays the next day. We would definitely stay here again. ","9"

"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Mona Lisa Apartment was just like the pictures and very charming! The Da Vinci theme was not lost on us... I loved the ""last supper"" on exposed brick.  Rooms were clean, bright and as pictured. Our host communicated beautifully and we were happy to find our accommodation in a new city with surprisingly little stress!
Private parking, laundry, two lovely decks, near bistros, across street from lovely cafe with the best croissants and cafe ole' , metro very close, 1.9 mile easy walk to Old Montreal, park nearby, ... We loved it! We will be back.","9"
"L'organisation entrée/sortie est très bien. Nous étions peu présents dans le logement (cuisine non utilisée), découverte de Montréal oblige!
Le logement est bien décrit dans l'annonce. Construction tout en long. Bien situé pour découvrir Montréal... sympathique Café situé juste en face.
Un bémol sur le nettoyage de la salle de bain et en particulier la baignoire... Mais ça se corrige.
Bon rapport qualité/prix. Pas de contact visuel avec Kenny, communication par mail... Code d'accès pour le logement. Merci de nous avoir permis de laisser nos bagages après 12h puisque nous avions un avion en soirée.

Kenny was super fast on our inquiries, and parking/checking in were a breeze. The location is great, with lots of awesome restaurants around, and the park not too far away. Would highly recommend. Thank you Kenny for the great stay!","9"
"The Monalisa is a fabulous place to stay in Montreal. It's location is smack in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants. It's a quick walk to wherever you want to go and the metro. Inside there is lots of space to stretch out. We were three people and never felt crowded. The bathroom is nice and the shower had plenty of hot water. Overall a good choice for a weekend in the city.","9"
"We had a great weekend at Monalisa! It was the perfect location for exploring the neighborhood and whole city. It was convenient for transportation and even had a parking spot. I would definitely recommend staying here.","9"
"Avec une arrivée très tardive, Kenny a été très compréhensible et donc nous avons pu rentrer dans le logement sans aucune difficulté. L'appartement est conforme aux photos, grand et très bien équipé. Proche du métro, et très bien placé, il est idéal pour les personnes voulant visiter la ville. Merci beaucoup Kenny, nous avons vraiment apprécié notre séjour à Montréal.","9"

"Basic apartment on 2nd floor of an old, 2nd Empire residential building. Front and rear porches. 3 nice bedrooms plus a sleep-able sofa & a spare queen mattress.

This place can easily accommodate 8 with a good measure of privacy.

Shops all around for basics & beer plus some lovely cheese shops and bakeries.

Great location.

2 Parking spaces in rear.","9"

"Place was great to stay at! Kenny is very accommodating and the space was great. Beds were very comfortable and clean. Cute neighbourhood and lots to see on foot, we did not use our car at all. ","9"
"Kenny's place was perfectly situated, just a 3 min walk from the metro and right across the road from a cute coffee shop (with lots more great restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance). Kenny was very quick to respond to questions and provided info clearly. We liked that the apartment had Netflix already set up, and the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils if you want to save some money and cook for yourself. Bring your own food staples though, (salt, sugar, butter, etc) as there was no food in the apartment. Parking spot was easy to find, and we enjoyed the general feel of the place (brick walls, a good amount of light, big stack of clean towels). Our only real complaints were first, that the apartment is listed as 1.5 bathrooms, but there was only 1. As there were 4 of us, this wouldn't have been a deal breaker but we would have liked to know what to expect ahead of time. And second, the bed in the back bedroom was not very comfortable (front bedroom was fine, and no one slept in the middle bedroom so I can't speak for its comfort level). All in all, I would recommend Kenny's apartment, I do wish we'd come during the spring or summer months to enjoy the two private balconies and backyard!","9"

"Nous étions trois collègues et l'appartement se prête tout à fait à cela. Trois chambres individuelles avec une salle de bain à partager. L'emplacement sur la rue Saint Denis est excellemment situé, proche des commerces et restaurants  et du métro Laurier et Mont-Royal.
Attention si vous venez de France, il n'y a pas de prise adaptateur, il faut venir avec mais il y en a au magasin la Source sur la rue Mont-Royal et probablement à plein d'autres endroits.
Pour faire la cuisine, il y a peu de vaisselle mais pour nous qui ne l'utilisions très simplement c'était suffisant.
Les chambres sont spacieuses avec une bonne literie. Nous ne rencontrons pas physiquement Kenny mais elle est très réactive et répond à toutes nos questions  pendant le séjour. Un petit soucis avec la porte d'entrée et son papa est là en 5 minutes. Il est très très gentil et arrangeant.
Bref un très bon séjour avec un bon rapport qualité prix.","9"
"The apartment is very good! I was there with my family (4 people in total) and we had a very good time. Close to cafe and restaurants, mont royal park and little Italy, the flat is also close to public transport and underground station. Communication with Kenny was precise and super easy.  I would like to repeat the experience in Montreal and I suggest to everyone this flat!","9"
"Kenny was a great host. The apartment was very clean, as expected. We had an issue parking where a guest staying in the other unit occupied 2 parking spots..which forced our car to get very close to the neighbours spot. I sent an email to Kenny and she contacted the other guest and got the parking situation resolved very quickly.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 116 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Kenny's place was such a great decision! It's right in the heart of Montreal. The rooms were kept clean and tidy, and the apartment as a whole was so quaint! It was perfect for 6 people. The parking space was helpful for anyone driving up, no need to find street parking. Kenny was very quick to respond to any questions I had! Definitely would recommend. ","9"
"Great location, with a parking spot smack in the middle of all the action. Many good choices for food, coffee, cocktails and enjoyment less than 5 minutes walk. The checkin process was super easy and Kenny was very quick about getting back to me about any questions. ","9"
"Convenient location and plenty of space, all worked out well.","9"
"There are a number of good things about this apartment: it's is in a great location, it has three bedrooms with good sized beds, the use of a private parking place is very helpful, and the wifi and hot water worked fine.

However, I expected something more upscale given the cost. We had water dripping inside the window when it rained at night, entry systems that stopped working (and some confusion over who to contact about that), light switches in odd places, one loud air conditioning unit for the whole apartment - a number of glitches. 

The apartment definitely worked for us during our four night stay. But there were a number of issues along the way.



","9"
"this was a great option for a decently-sized group of people looking to explore montreal on a budget; there is plenty of good-enough bedding (seems like there is at least one additional spare air mattress and couch space, if your party is more than 6 people). the location is stellar (walkable to many areas of interest, with good restaurants), and the check-in situation is hassle free.","9"
"Overall Kennys great place. Only suggestion would be for the tub, not a big deal but could use slight improvement.","9"
"A lovely place in a great location. I especially appreciated the small balconies in front and back, where we enjoyed our morning coffee and our evening glasses of wine. Only issue was with sheer curtains. You had better be prepared to get up when the sun does!","9"
"Average stay. Nothing outstanding.","9"
"Great location and nice light inside the house thanks to two skylights.  It's fairly quiet inside though the front bedroom gets some traffic noise from the street -- but nothing that would interfere with sleep as long as you're used to living in a city.

One thing to note is that the apartment is on the third floor and the rear staircase is somewhat precarious.  You might want to get a street parking spot in front of the house first to unlock the door and unload large items, then move the car to the dedicated parking spot in the back.  Otherwise it takes a minute or two to walk around the block from the back to the front or vice-versa.

A minor annoyance is that all the drains have fine mesh filters on them that get stuck very quickly.  We ended up having to clean out the bathroom filter pretty much every night.

Contrary to the description, the apartment does have a hair dryer, but did not have shampoo when we visited.  There's a drugstore across from the metro station if you need to pick anything up.
","9"
"Nice apartment in a great location. Lots to see and do nearby and a great space to stay with a group of people. We would definitely stay here again.","9"

"The space was awesome or our needs - really spacious with three bedrooms and an additional mattress. Very close to Mont Royal metro station. Exceptionally fast response to all communication - and very clear instructions. Only complaint is the air conditioning unit is just not sufficient for the space on a super hot day. First night was exceptionally uncomfortable - slowly got better as the nights after were much cooler. Really enjoyed everything else though and would recommend.","9"
"Very well situated near the Mont Royal tube station, with lots of restaurants and nice shops around. The street facing room gets very noisy because of traffic, but the other two are nice and quiet. The flat is well equipped and friendly. Kenny responded timely and well to all our requests. I'd go there again.","9"
"Bien placé et parfait pour une famille avec 3 enfants .","9"

"We had a very nice stay at Kenny's apartment.  He was very responsive via email and was able to accommodate a slightly earlier check-in for one of our guests.  

The apartment was in a nice location and well suited for a group of 3.  Would return to Kenny's apartment.","9"

"Logement très bien placé avec 3 belles chambres. Contrairement à ce qui est écrit dans le descriptif, pas de télé. Il faut appeler pour avoir le code wifi.
Logement qui mériterait d'être entretenu par l'hôte, notamment pour la partie nettoyage....attention rien pour cuisiner, pas de casserole, pas de saladier, même pas une planche à découper.","9"
"I have no doubt this was once a beauty (whenever the pics were taken). However, the host admitted that the space had been rented to a long term tenant and the evidence was everywhere...from cig butts left both inside and outside as well as drug paraphernalia left behind. Floor obviously had not been mopped in quite some time and it smelled of smoke. There was no tv (although it was in listing) and the smoke detector was not in working order and was not addressed when pointed out. Old linens were left behind but removed when requested due to smell. As well, the dishwasher was plugged into an extension cord, which was plugged into wall and would trip breaker when turned on same time as ac. On a positive note, location is great, ac worked and beds were comfy. ","9"
"The monalisa apartment lies in a wonderful neighborhood, with parks and the beautiful mount-Royal on one, and the vibrant quarter of mile’s end on the other. It’s close to the subway and is thus a good choice for every explorer. The inside of the home is pretty as well, even though it would benefit from a bit of refurbishing in some places. The host is incredibly fast in responding and very helpful though, so that was never much of an issue. All in all, i can recommend it for families.","9"

"Montreal Monalisa is located in an ideal location. Very close to the metro and restaurants. The outdoor terrace near the kitchen is a lovely place to have breakfast. We found the unit clean. 
Some observations. We saw 2 smoke alarms in the hanging basket. Not quite sure why they were there, but any future guest should ask about this. There was no toaster. Not quite sure if this was an oversight or are there electrical issues. They did have a portable air conditioner which provided enough cooling for the main area, but the bedrooms were warm. One of the fans did not work and another did not function as well as it should . There was not a third one.  An unusually warm time in Montreal, there needs to be better air flow in the bedrooms, which means three well functioning fans. Light switches were hard to find and some of the lights did not work. 
The main complaint is that they listed as an amenity, a parking space. This is not true. Fortunately, the manger was there when we arrived and very graciously got in my car and helped us find a public parking space that was good until we left. Public parking is very difficult in this neighborhood, so be aware that this could be a problem. ","9"

"No dedicated parking space (which is why I gave a 3 star rating). This was a big issue for us since we had a rental. Parking in Montreal is difficult and confusing for visitors. If you can’t read French it’s almost impossible. 

The apartment is in an amazing location (two metro stops very close) and is big for the area! (Deserves 5 stars) Three nice-sized bedrooms with loads of hanging closet space/storage space. Two small balconies, one facing the road and one facing the alley. Both are relaxing to sit on. Kitchen had all the amenities we needed. Nice size bathroom! The water pressure in the shower is very low. As a woman with medium length hair, I had to spend much more time than usual washing out my shampoo/conditioner. 

My main concern is the lack of communication from the host. If you call him, he answers, but if you email him through AirBnB (which he prefers), he either doesn’t answer or answers late. With our parking issue when we arrived this was a big deal for us. Just call him for any issues you might have.","9"

"Overall the stay was good. Generally as expected and in a good location. However some things could be improved. 

We ran out of toilet paper and the host told us where the new rolls were, but there was only one extra and we had already found and used it. So the last day of our stay was without any. 

I was also thrown off by a racist remark made by the host when we arrived, which came of an unnecessarily prolonged banter when we just wanted to unpack and rest. Probably would not stay here again for this reason alone.","9"

"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Rebekah, c'est un ami à elle qui nous a donné et repris les clés. Nous étions une famille de 4 (un bébé et un enfant de 4 ans).
Nous avons aimé : la proximité des commerces (supermarché, pharmacie, fruiterie, le chaleureux Rose Café), le bus au pied de l'immeuble, la taille de l'appartement confortable pour 4, 
Nous avons moins aimé : l'appartement pas très propre (odeur de cigarette, cendrier pas vidé, mégot dans la chambre - pour un logement non fumeur !!- le parquet qui noircit les genoux de notre fille à quatre pattes, le frigo pas vidé, la poussière sous les coussins des canapés ... et j'en passe), le manque d'équipement (balai, aspirateur, vaisselle pour préparer à manger), la machine à laver défectueuse (elle est tombée en panne après 2 utilisations, nous avons du aller en laverie), les lumières cassées dans les 2 chambres (que nous avons réparées), la TV qui est en fait un écran pour regarder des DVD, le couchage pour la 3e personne dans la petite chambre fermée est en fait un canapé non convertible de 1 mètre de long (notre fils de 4 ans ne pouvait pas dormir dessus ...). Rebekah nous a donc fait passer un matelas gonflable.
C'est un appartement à moindre cout, certes, mais pas conforme à la description. Bien pour un couple qui aime manger à l’extérieur.","6"
"L'appartement de Fannie est un appartement typique du quartier de Villeray avec beaucoup de charme. Appartement propre, parfait pour un couple !!!!
Le quartier est très sympa avec pas mal de restos et commerces à proximité de l'appartement. La station de métro Jarry est à 2 minutes à pied et permet d'accéder au centre de Montréal très facilement. 
Je le recommande sans hésiter !!!
On a tellement aimé ce quartier qu'on veut s'y installer  ;)","9"
"Le logement est très chaleureux et agréable dans l'ensemble. J'ai beaucoup aimé le quartier pour sa proximité avec de nombreux endroits qui me tiennent à coeur : parc, marché talon, Villeray... Le métro est très pratique, à  2 min à pied, en quelques minutes on se retrouve en plein coeur de Montréal. 
Le logement en soi est plaisant, mais très peu lumineux. La chambre est super, la literie nous a fait passé de très bonnes nuits. 
Le ménage pourrait être plus soigné, le lieu ne respirait pas très bien quand nous sommes arrivés. Petit hic aussi avec le voisinage, nous avons eu un concerto chaque soir qui peut être parfois dérangeant quand on rentre pour avoir du calme après une journée entière passée dans le son constant de la ville. 
Merci à Fannie en tout cas qui est très agréable et arrangeante, merci à elle avec la distance d'avoir été présente quand nous avions besoin. ","9"
"J'ai passé un super séjour dans cet appartement. C'est une grande collocation avec un grand groupe de personnes et tout le monde est très sympa et sait mettre à l'aise. En quelques jours ils m'ont fait visiter Montréal, m'ont aidé avec mes démarches administratives et les différences entre le Canada et mon pays d'origine, nous avons fait de grands repas communs... 
Je recommande particulièrement ce séjour pour les gens qui sont actifs et veulent faire des rencontres. Il y a toujours du monde à l'appartement, c'est vivant et pour les gens qui savent l’apprécier cela peut-être génial. 
Il n'est pas loin du bus / métro. J'ai pu me rendre plusieurs fois au centre de Montréal sans problème en peu de temps. 
L'appartement est plus grand que les photos ne laissent à penser. 
Ma chambre était spacieuse et agréable. Aucun problème niveau propreté. 
Malgré la courte durée de mon séjour, je sais que je vais garder contact avec mes hôtes et continuer de passer régulièrement. 

Tl;dr : Plus grand que sur les photos, rien de négatif à dire, très vivant et gros gros plus sur la convivialité et le charme des collocs. ","10"

"Super séjour. Catherine (la colocataire de Jonathan) est très sympa, souriante et à l'écoute. Ce fut un vrai plaisir d'être en vacances chez eux. Le logement est propre, confortable et bien équipé (bonne connection internet; lave linge & sèche linge; bureau pour travailler...). La chambre  est plutôt spacieuse. Le rapport qualité prix est très bien selon moi. J'ai pu profiter de la terrasse sur le toit avant qu'il ne fasse trop froid. L'appartement est bien situé, il y a des parcs et des rues marchande pas très loin, les autres rues marchande ne sont pas très loin non plus, j'y allais souvent à pied (Mont Royal que j'aime bien est à 30min de marche). Il y a de bon restaurant et de très bon café à moins de 5 minutes de marche. Le metro est à environ à 10-15 minutes. Il y à aussi une station de vélo et une bonne épicerie à quelque minutes.
Le quartier est sympa, la rue est calme. Pour ceux qui veulent faire du shopping ou du lèche vitrine il faudra surement prendre le metro pour aller un peu plus loin. Mais facilement accessible avec le metro.
Très bonne première expérience airbnb.

"This is was a great place to stay for my trip in Montreal. You have a great coffee 2 blocks from the apartment called Etincele. Really friendly place and great coffee and home made Madeleine. If you want to buy some cheap fruits and vegetables; go to the shop at corner of Papineau and Beaubien. You also have a great shop at Beaubien and La roche on the way to the metro. 
You will be able to enjoy the rooftop for sunbaking or a apero at the sunset.","10"

L'Appartment est chaleureux et la terrasses sur le toît est tout simplement géniale. Il y avait des petites bouteilles de savon et shampoing sur les serviettes laissé à disposition. Ce qui a été très appréciées. Catherine est très accueillante et facile d'Accès.  Si vous chercherz un coin mignon et âs trop bruyant de Montréal, petite-Patrie est parfait pour vous. La seule chose qui pour moi serait a améliorer est la poussière sur le plancher dela chambre et la cuisine. Somme toute, l'expérience générale est positive.","10"

"Beatrice's place was great. Can't complain about anything at all. Location was great, the place was spacious, the bed was comfortable, the kitchen had everything you need to cook and serve a full meal (I did not get a chance to use it). 
At first I was skeptical about the place because it had no reviews and the main contact number on Airbnb is not a local one. But there was really no reason to as Beatrice provides you a direct contact number to her mother, who handed me the keys. 
They were both very accommodating on check-in times. Marie is very sweet, she told me what was around the area and ways to get around. She made sure I had everything I needed before she left. 
I would definitely stay again, it would be my first choice if available on my next trip back to Montreal. ","10"

"Logement bien situé, proche du métro, stationnement facile dans la rue, suffisamment spacieux pour 4 personnes. La climatisation nous a permis de passer de bonnes nuits durant cette semaine de canicule. Points à améliorer  : fournir plus de couverts (insuffisants pour 4 pers) rajouter de la déco sur certains murs vides.
Nous remercions Jason de nous avoir accordé un départ tardif pour pouvoir regarder le match de quart de finale de la coupe du monde de la France.","9"
"The reason I booked Jason's place is because I attended a conference at the Palais de Congres de Montreal. For the price, I would say that I made a good choice! My friend and I drove to Montreal and we didn't arrive until around 2 am. Jason gave very detailed instructions for self check in which made it really convenient as I wouldn't want to bother him at that time. After we had arrived in  Montreal, we commuted throughout our stay. It is a 7-min walk to the metro and I would say that the neighborhood is pretty quiet and safe (there were times when we went home around 1 am). Jason told me that we could park our car in the backyward which was a bit difficult to find since Jason did not respond when I asked him about it (not a big deal though because my friend and I figured it out eventually). The condo is just as how it looks like in pictures, and I especially loved the kitchen and the bathroom. There were essentials he left for us like soap, shampoo, towels etc. During our stay, we lost Wi-Fi for about a day and Jason fixed it as soon as he can. Overall, our stay was nice. I would book his place again. Thanks Jason!","9"
"My cousin and I stayed in Montreal for 5 days. The apartment location offered us everything we needed for those few days: easy access to bus and metro and convenience store.  The accommodations were lovely; offered a fully stocked kitchen that we decided to cook after a jaunt to the Marche Jean –Talon. On the evenings we enjoyed relaxing and cooling down in the really good AC. Wifi worked perfectly as (Website hidden by Airbnb) spottiness.  Highly recommend for anyone looking for a neighborhood experience, that’s very economical and still connects you to the city in less than 25 mins. ","9"
"Great place to stay if you want to visit Montréal. Metro is a 8 min walk away and very doable. Very clean apartment and full kitchen if you want to cook. Definitely recommend.","9"
"El apartamento está equipado con todo lo que se necesita para vivir en una casa, además que es moderno, bonito y cómodo. 
Está a 10 minutos del metro Sauvé, con lo que se tarda unos 20-25 minutos al centro. //
The apartment is equiped with everything you need for living in it. 
It takes 10 minutes to the metro stop called Sauvé, so it tales like 10-15 minutes to the City center.","9"
"Beau logement très agréable et propre dans un quartier calme. Manque d'ustensiles et de couverts dans la cuisine. 10 minutes à pieds du métro. Belle réactivité du propriétaire à mes mails.","9"
"Notre séjour chez Jason s'est très bien passé, l'appartement est spacieux et plutôt confortable, la salle de bain est neuve et propre. L'appartement est à 8 min à pied du métro Sauvé sur la ligne orange donc pratique pour rejoindre le centre. L'entrée est autonome et donc permet une flexibilité pour l'heure d'arrivée. La communication avec Jason s'est également bien passée. Seuls petits bémols, le canapé qui était en mauvais état et ne permettait pas un autre couchage, le manque de décoration et d'investissement dans l'appartement et le manque de vaisselle, à peine assez pour 4.","9"

"Staying at Sabrina's place in the Plateau neigborhood was the best experience I've ever had as my second time visiting Montreal because she was resourceful and helpful in suggesting to my mother and I for us to go to such as trendy restaurants and places to see in Montreal but most of all her apartment was clean and had everything I needed. I would strongly recommend others to stay at her place. Thank you Sabrina for everything.","9"
"Sabrina was a very nice woman who was extremely helpful. Her apartment is in a very safe neighborhood and was close to shops restaurants. I was told I could choose a room. When we arrived she had placed us in the less apealing room, which was the guest room.  I was more then happy to be there as we were right next to the bathroom and I would have felt very odd taking over her bedroom.  She let us use her condiments which was greatly appreciated. We cooked a lot and she was very respectful of giving us space that we were seeking.  Overall the price was awesome the area was great Sabrina was very cool and so is her decor in her home!  Ten times better than a hotel. Home away from home!","9"
"This is a tidy and nice place in the Montreal downtown. The apartment is in a calm and quiet street.

I recommend staying in her place.","9"

"Sabrina has a very pretty apartment. She takes good care of it, and the apartment was clean. She was very accommodating to us, giving us a big well-thought out list of everything we need to know and do. She sent out emails and reminder or how to get to the apartment, and gave us some helpful tips on places to eat and whatnot. She even provided us with a second clean pair of bed sheets and allowed us to use pans and spices to cook (as eating out can get quite expensive!)

"The apartment was awesome! Great location with lots of restaurants, bars,  super markets and shopping stores, just 5 minuts away by bus from the metro station. Sabrina was very nice with us, i really recommend this place!  ","9"
"We had a great time at Sabrinas place! She welcomed us very friendly and made it easy for us to feel at home. Because Sabrina went on vacation, we had the whole apartment for ourselves. That was just so nice! =) Anyway, having Sabrina stay with us would have been fun too, that's for sure. 

We also liked: the great neighborhood (many cute cafes, restaurants, boutiques), the quiet building, the big comfy bed, easy access to bus/metro, being able to cook in the evening, the easy communication with Sabrina and Montreal in general! =)

Thanks for the great stay, Sabrina!","9"
"Appartement tres sympa, tranquille, bon quartier a 10min du metro Mont royal ! acceuil chaleureux, par contre il serait judicieux d investir dans une couette ou une bonne couverture pour la chambre d amis, car le petit dessus de lit ne suffit pas, surtout a partir de debut octobre !!!","9"
"Mi estadía en Montreal con Sabri no pudo haber sido mejor. Su departamento es igual que las fotos, o aún más bonito. El barrio Plateau es uno de los más lindos y preferidos en Montreal, con muchos árboles y casitas con escaleras. Realmente me sentí como en casa. No solo porque en el departamento tuve todo lo que necesitaba, sino porque Sabrina es una gran persona y una excelente host. Me ayudó con unos trámites personales, siempre con mucha alegría y afecto. Además habla español per-fec-to. Me hubiera gustado quedarme mas tiempo, la verdad.","9"

"Sabrina's home is just lovely and a perfect place to stay in Montreal. As she had to leave for the first two weeks of my stay, I did not get to see her the whole time, however when she was there she was really nice and made me feel very welcome. Her place became nearly a second home. The pictures are true, it is just so nice as they show it. Her place is in the plateau the best place to be when you like being close to restaurants, coffees and alternative stores. Sabrina explained me where to buy organic food and where to go out! I absolutely enjoyed my stay in Montreal. My Highlight was defiantly when she showed me how to do homemade granola and an delicious lentil soup. I am looking forward to see her again and to share a swiss meal. I can only recommend to stay with her and I will certainly go back. 

Thank you Sabrina!","9"
"Sabrina was very accommodating on our arrival even though we arrived quite late.  The apartment and room were very comfortable and clean.  She greeted us on arrival, and then was not in the apartment the rest of our stay.  Location was great.","9"
"Sabrina is super nice and sweet person! I absolutely enjoyed staying at her house. The house is well decorated and clean and I felt very comfortable every time I came home :) when I come back to Montreal, I would love to stay here again ;) 
About the location of the house, I found it very convenient to go anywhere. It is quite close to center of the city or anywhere. However, it's probably a good idea to have the bus schedule with you all the time so that you wouldn't need to  walk for 20mins to the metro (especially in the winter :P) besides that, there are lots of stores around to get anything so you wouldn't have any problems! over all, I absolutely loved there :) thank you Sabrina <3 ","9"
"everything was perfect!
thank you Sabrina !:)","9"
"Sabrina est très accueillante et très généreuse à mon égard. Il y avait de la place pour moi déjà toute prête dans le garde manger et le frigo et elle m'a offert à prendre ce dont j'avais besoin pour cuisiner. C'est une hôte du tonnerre!","9"
"Notre séjour chez Sabrina a été très agréable. Toujours de bons conseils, accueillante et à l'écoute. 
L'appartement est fidèle aux photos et proche de tous les services. Le quartier est calme et résidentiel. L'avenue Mont-Royal offre son lot d'animations (bars, restos). 
Nous recommandons. ","9"
"Sabrina's apartment was even better than we'd expected- so sunny, so comfortable, and so beautiful and quirky at the same time! We loved spending the weekend in Montreal having Sabrina's apt as our home base. The location was great, near many fun bars, restaurants, and the bus that takes you straight to the top of Mount Royal. She was also very friendly and accommodating. I'd recommend her place to anybody! ","9"
"Sabrina was a great host! The flat was nice and cosy. When I arrived she showed me the way to my room and explained what is where. Sabrina advised me where to go and what to do in the city :) We did not have much time to spend together, but whenever we had an opportunity we had a wee chat - she was happy to speak with me in French which I liked a lot :)","9"
"Sabrina was really friendly and even gave us a list of her favourite restaurants, cafes, bars etc for us.","9"
"Great location in The Plateau.. handy bus and Metro from the main street only a minute away.

The outside of the building is run down but the surrounds are pretty and the inside of the unit was a nice style.  ","9"
"Sabrina is an excellent host, so friendly and respectful! The apartment has a great location in The Plateau and there are very good connections by bus and Metro. There are many stores, bars and parks around. I absolutely enjoyed staying at this place and I'd recommend it without a doubt!","9"
"Vous désirez passer du bon temps à Montréal ? L'appartement de Sabrina est la place qu'il vous faut! Spacieux, ensoleillé, bien placé dans le quartier du Plateau, ce logement est une perle où j'ai eu beaucoup de plaisir à apprécier mon séjour dans cette magnifique ville.
Sabrina a été une hôte parfaite (: . Vous allez vous sentir comme à la maison!","9"
"Sabrina is a wonderful host. She makes sure your stay is pleasant in any way. The apartment is even better than the photos. I'll recommed it .","9"
"Notre première expérience avec Airbnb fut une totale réussite. L'appartement, bien situé,est agréable,propre, bien agencé et effectivement ensoleillé.  Quant à notre hôte nous avons beaucoup apprécié ses qualités d'accueil, sa discrétion et son dynamisme. Adresse à recommander.","9"
"Visited Montreal for the first time, and my friends and I, spent the weekend at Sabrina's quaint and cozy apartment. The space was very neatly organized and kept, and located in a lovely part of neighborhood. The location was very accessible to the city's core. The apartment is as exactly displayed through the posted pictures. Although Sabrina was not around during my stay, she made sure to leave instructions, and kept in contact with me throughout my time there. I also appreciated the list of places Sabrina suggested to visit, and activities that could be done throughout the weekend. Thank you again for your hospitality!","9"
"Sabrina was on vacation when we visited and was still able to make us feel comfortable and welcome.  Little notes were left for us with info on Montreal and the different places she recommended us to go and see. We loved the location too it was close to main bus routes, parks, and in an older neighbourhood in Montreal (the architecture was beautiful!).  We had a chance to meet Sabrina as we were leaving and she was friendly, and kind and down-to-earth. We loved our stay and already miss Montreal! ","9"
"Sabrina was a great host. We stayed at her place for 3 days. The place' situation is nice in the Plateau. Sabrina showed us where to go and what to visit. I would recommend people going to Montreal to stay at her place.","9"
"My wife and I stayed with Sanrina for two nights. It was an excellent stay with nice accommodation that is close to several fun areas. The apartment itself is very nice and clean. Sabrina is a really nice host that will make you feel comfortable","9"
"Sabrina was very friendly and easy to chat with. Offers some good ideas and materials for sightseeing. Apartment is convenient for tourists since it is close to the bus and metro stations with a supermarket nearby.","9"
"Accueil très chaleureux, séjour agréable et échanges intéressants avec notre hôte. Appartement situé dans un quartier calme et bien desservi par les transports en commun.","9"
"Sabrina's place was exactly how it is pictured, and what I expected. She was very accommodating for my check-in and check-out time, making it so easy for me as a traveller. The neighbourhood is great, with lots green space, coffee shops, and restaurants recommended by Anthony Bordain himself. The only thing that could make Sabrina's place better were if were closer to the subway, but there is a bus that goes by often enough to take you there.","9"
"My friends and I stayed at Sabrina's place when we were in Montreal for osheaga and it was great!!! She was so helpful leading up to our trip. Her place was exactly like the pictures and we all had a great time!","9"
"L'accueil fut chaleureux et sympathique. Sabrina était charmante.
l' appartement correspond aux images . Mais le quartier et le bâtiment  sont un peu différents à ce qu'on pourrait imaginer. Il est calme et près des commerces quotidiens. Tout s'est très bien passé.
Encore grand merci à Sabrina pour sa gentillesse.
 ","9"
"Sabrina contacted me prior to our arrival to ensure she'd be there upon our arrival.  Upon our arrival she had everything ready for us and didn't leave until she was satisfied we had everything we needed. She had maps, sticky notes, tour guides, key, tea, granola, spices, laundry machine, you name it she had it covered.  She even contacted me on day two to make sure we were all set.  The location is two blocks from Mount Royal.  Wonderful boutiques, groceries, cafes, and restaurants. Our only issue was the walk to the metro.  We tried the bus, but there wasn't always one. For avid walkers, the 20 minutes walk to and fro would not be an issue. I resorted to parking on the street near the metro then walked. Not a big deal.","9"
"Très bon accueil de la part Sabrina.
Appartement confortable pour 4 personnes.
Quartier tranquille un peu éloigné du centre accessible par Bus et plus loin du metro (20 minutes).Le batiment et la rue ne correspondaient pas à ce que nous attendions (3 eme étage d'un immeuble) alors que nous imaginions une entrée typique du plateau Mont-Royal avec accès directe par escalier de la rue.","9"
"Sabrina was a very nice host.
We had a few contacts before my arrival in Montreal. She contacted me to inform me where to find the keys for the apartment in case she was not there at the time of my arrival. As it turned out, she was there to meet me and thank God for that, because on my own I would not been able to carry my 23 kgs bag  3 floors up. The place was neat and tidy, the neighbourhood was ok and Sabrina was a very warm and friendly person.
The location of the apartment was a few metro stops from the city of Montreal .
My 5 day stay there was comfortable and pleasant. Thank you Sabrina for all your help.

"Sabrina was a very laid-back and friendly host and it was a pleasure to stay at her place.  She was flexible about check-in and check-out times and made our stay even better by providing recommendations of places to eat and visit in her area.  The neighbourhood was very vibrant, with shops, restaurants, cafes, a big park, and a fabulous bakery all within a 10-min walk.  Her place is close to bus routes and we found it to be a great home-base for our stay in Montreal.  The photos and description on her Airbnb post are accurate, and her place is very clean, stylish, and welcoming.  Thanks for a nice experience, Sabrina!","9"
"When we arrived, Sabrina provided us a tour of her apartment and then sat down and mapped out all the metro, bus stations, recommended eateries, etc. After that she went on her way and we didnt see her the remainder of our trip. The apartment itself was in a quiet neighborhood in the Plateau and we were two blocks from small shopping and food places. Overall her place was nice. Note their is no A/C so it was nice that she had plug in fans in each room. The only downside was the guest bedroom bed was not that comfortable (but if you like firm mattress you will be okay) and the kitchen had ants (which is due to the time of the year).","9"
"Sabrina is an excellent host! She contacted me a couple of days before arrival to make sure I could get in. She and her boyfriend even helped me carry bag up the stairs. She was very friendly and immediately gave me a map and some tips for Montreal. The appartement is luminated, clean, charming. The room is big with lot's of storage room.  Also nice bathroom. Apartment was in a quiet neigbourhood but close to the centre. Lot's of bars and restaurants in the Mont Royal street closeby. To be recommended! ","9"
"She is friendly, warm. Her house is very good, I like here! Around to have a meal very convenient also!","9"
"Excelente anfitriona ... Es muy fácil llegar al departamento el cual está en un barrio muy interesante con muchas opciones de mercados, restaurantes y pocas estaciones del centro de Montreal. Sabrina y su novio me dieron muchos típs de al ciudad los cuales aproveche al 100 %. Saludos ","9"

Sabrina is super friendly and very helpful in getting me to feel at home. ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 148 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"The apartment was just about as advertised, save for a few things. Free parking was listed, but there was no parking to be found. We ended up getting a ticket the first day. We eventually found a lot in the city (15mins away by über) to leave the car for the week, but that was a hassle checking up on it all the time. Also, while there is a washer and dryer it is the basement of the apartment for the use of all the tenants which cost money, so timing is key. We ended up walking to a laundromat a few blocks away and isingnthat instead. Apart from that, stay was pleasant and the apartment was comfortable. Several easy restaurant options nearby. ","9"
"We felt very welcome during our stay with Sabrina. The apartment is in a beautiful neighborhood and the location made it easy to explore Montreal.","9"
"Sabrina was an amazing host. The apartment is beautiful, and just around the corner of Rue du Mont-Royal, which is home to a plethora of shops and restaurants - meaning if you choose to stay here, you have plenty of options for food and shop. Each morning I went for a walk down the beautiful street and stopped at some coffee shops on the way. It's also just a few minutes walk to the Metro, which is great if you'd like to explore the rest of Montreal. Or you can hop on a Bixi bike close to the apartment and ride downtown. But the best part of the apartment is how close it is to (what I believe to be) the best poutine spot in Montreal - La Banquise. The location is perfect for both young folks looking to have an exciting night out and families alike. Sabrina's apartment was clean, fresh and easy to access. Overall very pleased with my experience. Thank you, Sabrina! ","9"
"Sabrina provided a welcoming stay in Montreal. Her apartment is cozy and she made sure that I felt at home, although I only saw her a couple of times. The neighborhood does have great access to public transportation, but is also walkable. Great restaurants and pubs a short distance away. A great place to stay and you can't beat the price!","9"
"Best place to stay when youre in montreal! Very nice neighborhood, youre really fast in downtown, good restaurants around. And the most important thing: sabrina is very helpful and such a nice person! When you have time: just join her and visit montreal!","9"

"It was a really good experience in Sabrina's place, she was so kind and open to my comments and to talk with me about anything, she was always looking after me if I needed something else.
Great communication in English and if you know Spanish she will be glad to practice with you.
There are several bus routes that can take you wherever you want, and they all connect with the metro system with the same boarding card.","9"
"Sabrina was so great. She had these little maps and cool places to go check out in the city. I stayed here while looking for a more permanent place to live and she was incredibly helpful! She even translated my resume for me as my french is a little weak. Anyway, i would definitely recommend!","9"
"Sabrina was great! The check in process was super easy, she was very accommodating for my check in time. The room was very nice and spacious. Her place is close to a lot of major bus routes which made transportation very easy. She also had lots of suggestions for places to go and experience. Overall a very good stay.","9"
"Sabrina is beyond lovely & so is her home! She was very flexible for my late check in/late check out. The home was clean, quiet & beautiful with lots of natural light (apt building does not have an elevator). It is located in a very nice area close to bus routes a block or two away in every direction, convenience store on the corner, a handful of restaurants very close by, as well as Mont-Royal Ave a block away which has tons of shops, cafes, restaurants, grocery stores, bars, pharmacies, metro station & access to the top of Mont-Royal Park much further down. She provides the essentials, water/towels, space in the hallway closet, space in the cupboard/fridge in the kitchen, wifi access, ability to adjust the temperature of the room & washing machine to do laundry if needed (hang dry only though). Communication was easy & I appreciated the help/suggestions when I had questions but also the privacy I was given other times. I would 150% stay here again & highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in a nice neighbourhood out of the city but still with access to MANY things to do! Thank you again Sabrina!","9"

There are many shops and restaurants around the corner that I would recommend to explore. I stayed during wintertime and enjoyed very much the comfortable environment that the host and the city had to offer. I would defiantly will be coming back during summer time!","9"
"Laurence was away during my stay. Before leaving, she reached out to me and left me very detailed instructions on how everything worked. I did not need to reach out to her at all during my stay. The apartment was clean and welcoming. It felt homie. I could feel the personality of the host in the space she had created. The neighborhood is safe and beautiful. Coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores are all walking distance away. There is a frequent bus that brings you directly to the metro. All in all, great experience. Thank you Laurence.","10"
"Laurence's place was so cozy! Great sushi place right around the corner, and very convenient to the bus/metro. ","10"
"L'appartement est très bien situé et les communications avec Laurence se sont très bien déroulées.  

Par contre, un petit bémol concernant la propreté : c'était poussiéreux (j'ai été très allergique) et la literie n'avait pas été changée avant notre arrivée.","10"

Loved the cozy vintage style of the apartment, super comfy bed and massive kitchen! Would love stay again thanks Laurence!!","10"
"Wonderful space and very clean!","10"
"This place is great! There are several good places to eat nearby, a Tunisian place a block away and the best vegan pastries ever (and I'm not vegan) at Cafe dei campi on Rosemont. The metro/bus system is very easy to get around even though the place is a little far from most of the touristy stuff. The bathroom was clean and towels/toilet paper/etc were provided. Washer/dryer in unit, which was nice when we spent all of the first day outside in the rain.","10"

"Raed""s flat is perfect for a stay in Montreal (I spent 1 week in there). Very clean, all equipments required, big bath + shower, very central location. Very nice shared terrace on the roof. I also rented a bicycle and their a safe place to park it. 
When so I haven't met Raed during my trip, as he was abroad, he was very welcoming and read to provide help and tips when required. I can then strongly recommend Raed's place.","10"
"Apartment is in a fantastic area, two seconds to the Metro, walkable t o the plateau and downtown. Bixi bike stop right beside the Metro as well.
I was extended for work and there were literally no hotel rooms that met my work cost guidelines. Raed's apartment was cheaper and infinitely better than the room I was staying at and was closer to the metro too.

Raed made check in a breeze and worked with me when my plans changed for checkout. He was available via text and phone and helped me all the way through.

Next time I'm in Montreal, this will be my first choice for accommodation.","10"
"Logement fantastique! Il est situé en plein cœur du Quartier des spectacles, très sécuritaire et lumineux. L'hôte Raed a été très facile à joindre, prévenant et attentionné. Une perle.","10"
"The apartment is in a great location and Raed was an accommodating host. Great place to stay.","10"
"This is a great apartment and Raed is a very nice and accommodating host. However, I had a couple issues with this trip. This is nothing against Raed or his place. Both the apartment and the host are great. Just a few logistical, subjective-comfort, and communication related things. 

When asking Raed about potential noise in the apartment, before I booked, he said ""this is all very subjective... it should be fine."" When I got to the apartment, there was major construction (which begins at around (8-9AM) surrounding the apartment (the apartment is on a right angle on a major intersection near Place de Arts) and the music from nearby festivals (very loud) begins in the afternoon and ends late at night at around 11PM-12AM. 

I was aware of how close the festivals were, but based on Raed's comment, I figured it would be relatively quiet and didn't anticipate such loud music and construction. I was a bit annoyed when I got to the apartment and for the first few days, I was bombarded with construction early in the morning and then blaring music for most of the day. This may have been miscommunication, or maybe it is a new issue, but I felt somewhat misled. Now this might not bother anyone else, which is fine. But I did ask about the noise level before I booked. And yet, the experience I had wound up contradicting what I had been told by the host. So make sure you ask specific questions if you have specific concerns. And if you are looking for quiet during the day — good luck!

There was also some initial confusion when trying to book the apartment because the dates that were listed as available were not actually all available. In fact, I had to change my reservation from June 12-26 to June 12-20 because Raed had his own plans with the apartment from the 20th onward but this was not reflected on AirBnB and it wasn’t until after I booked my dates that I found out the the apartment wouldn’t be available after the 20th. This lack of clarity in communication was pretty inconvenient for me. Plus, I had to wait to hear back from and constantly inquire with Raed when trying to find out the actual available dates to see if the apartment was going to be available or not. Even after I booked, the dates listed as available remained inaccurate. If I didn't keep contacting him, I'm not sure how things would have turned out. This put a some stress on my travel plans, which were admittedly very last minute. I realize Raed was probably very busy, but it's always the little, logistical things that matter.

Despite these relatively minor issues, I must state that Raed was very accommodating and responsive during my actual trip, very friendly, and in the end - he was very considerate by allowing me to check out a few days early.

Great apartment. Great host.","10"
"The place is ideally located right on the Place des Arts and the flat itself is very enjoyable to live in. And above all, Raed is an extremely kind and attentive host. Overall, I very highly recommend both the flat and its host. Definitely my go-to place for my future journeys in Montreal.","10"
"Great place. Amazing location, very close to everything. The common area is big and comfortable. There is a lot of natural light which i liked. Raed was nice and fast in communication.","10"
"Raed is helpful, friendly and patient. Although my stay was somehow short, the house was super clean and prepared for me.","10"
"The apartment is as appears on the picture. Clean, cosy, and with a  pleasant ambience and all basic facilities such as towels, kettle, toaster, iron, etc There's a coffee place downstairs, metro right opposite, grocery store 5 minutes away and within easy walking reach to the heart of downtown Montreal and Mcgill university. The hosting service was awesome. We were granted early check in and easy access into the building which was great after our 17 hour journey. I would definitely recommend it to friends and will look out for it on my next visit.","10"
"It is a wonderful apartment. I enjoyed it a a lot. It is very good located and everything you need is close. I would choose it again if I will come back to Montreal some day.

"This was a beautiful stay, much appreciated.  Raed and Hidaya were accommodating in every way, kind, generous, and flexible.  The home was immaculate, better than a 5-Star Hilton.  Its proximity to the Hyatt and the downtown area, transit, restaurants, everything was ideal.  There wasn't a single thing that could be improved upon.  Special thanks to Raed and Hidaya for being such great people.","10"
"love this place.  perfect spot downtown montreal,  close to everything and i would love to stay here again in august when i go.  love it.","10"
"Would recommend to travellers who like to be in the middle of what’s happening in town. Easy access to main tourist attractions.","10"
"The location is phenomenal.  You could honestly park your car and toss your transportation passes.  This place is close to everything.  The host was mostly responsive.  

Only issue I had was not having access to the rooftop for the entire 7 days I stayed.   The nice rooftop is included in the description for this place, so that was a major selling point for me to book the space, making it simply disappointing that I didn’t have access.  The host was not able to provide an answer on how to get acesss to the rooftop.   Finally, I booked the entire apartment, and it was listed as full apartment access.  The room you actually get is the smaller room with the bed that looks more slim and less comfortable.  I had a good rest in the room I slept in, but I assumed that having the apartment to myself would allow me to sleep in the nicer room that is actually pictured on the website.  Not sure why it is pictured if it is not available to potential guests.  

Outside of those things, Raed was very quick to respond and good to work with.   

I would return to this Airbnb, unless a place with proper rooftop access is available.  

Cheers","10"
"Great setup, nice place.","10"
"Appartement bien situé, idéal pour un 1er séjour à Montréal.","10"
"I very much enjoyed my return to Montreal. Hidaya and Raed's place is very lovely, with great lighting in a great location as you're close to downtown, the Plateau, Old Montreal or wherever else you want to go on the island. I would definitely stay again. Thank you!","10"

Right near the metro station and a free private parking spot is available if you need it. It was very relaxing. The communication with William and Susan was great. I would receive a reply within minutes whenever I needed to know something. When I arrived, William came out to help me find his parking spot and offered to help me with my things. I would definitely stay here again. ","10"

"Sue and Williams's place is extremely clean and everything is new. They have a lot of appliances for everyone's needs. They welcomed us with muffins, water, juice boxes and coffee (keurig machine) and just doing little things like putting up our wiper blades up so they don't freeze overnight. You will not be disappointed if you book with them :) ","10"
"Anyone staying in Montreal would be lucky to have Sue & Will as their hosts. It is obvious that Susan takes this seriously and wants to make sure that you have the best trip possible. This was my first Airbnb and it was 10x better than any hotel and at a great rate. The apt was emaculate; she had it decorated for the holidays and had snacks I love, (toaster streudels) in the freezer. The metro is so close.  Can't say enough of what good hosts they were,(Will even brushed our car off for us) thanks guys!","10"

They pay attention to all the details, provide everything needs for a comfortable stay, and go far above and beyond what could be expected as hosts.  I highly recommend this apartment!","10"
"Williams and Sue's place was fantastic! It's clean, modern, quiet and central. We were able to park our car at the apartment so we used Uber and the Metro which was a two minute walk from the apartment. We were able to walk to the Olympic park and bio dome and took the metro to the Montreal Canadians game which saved us on car parking. Sue was very responsive to our message and made us feel very welcome! We would definitely recommend their apartment and would love to stay again! Thank you for making our stay so pleasant, Hannah and Dan.","10"

"We had excellent communication from William and Susan right from the get go! Even before we booked with them, they very promptly responded to our messages. They offered us a lot of extra help when we first arrived, they let us park our car earlier on the day we arrived as well and we received a warm goodbye when we left the next day. The apartment is Beautiful, homey, very clean, and we walked into a lot of extras that we were not expecting… Food and drinks in the fridge, food in the freezer, complementary goodies on the dining room table with a welcoming note from William and Susan... and more. All-in-all, we had a wonderful stay and are looking forward to staying in this apartment again!","10"
"À deux minutes de marche du métro Pie-IX et dix minutes du magnifique Jardin Botanique, avec le biodôme et l'insectarium... C'est parfait ! Plusieurs restaurants sont à proximité, et si on veut profiter du calme et du confort de l'appartement la livraison est possible ! Nous avons beaucoup aimé le restaurant indien tout près. Un énorme merci à nos hôtes qui sont attentionnés. William m'a écrit afin de vérifier que notre séjour se passait bien et s'est montré disponible, bien que nous ne nous soyons pas croisé. Si nous avons à revenir dans le secteur L'Idéal sera sur notre liste !","10"
"Appartement très propre et confortable.
Petites attentions très appréciées.
Propriétaires très disponibles.
Stationnement facile et libre.","10"
"L'idéal a été super lors de mon court séjour à Montréal! Le milieu est très calme, à quelques minutes de tout ce qui est nécessaire et environ à dix minutes de centre-ville. La communication avec William se fait très bien si jamais il y a des questions.
Je recommande ce logement à tous qui vient visiter Montréal!","10"
"The space and location are perfect.   It was nice to have the biodome, stadium, and Metro all within a quick walking distance from us when my group stayed over.  The place in itself is clean and nicely decorated.  The hosts are always quick to respond, and very friendly.  They provide complimentary treats as well!  All in all we had a positive stay, and I would definitely recommend this place to others!","10"
"Appartement très agréable à vivre et bien équipé. William et Susan sont super attentifs à ce que tout se passe bien et ont toujours de gentilles attentions. L'appartement est très propre et il y fait bon vivre le temps d'un séjour. Le quartier est sympa et la proximité du Métro rend Montréal centre facilement accessible. Pour les courses, il y a le Super C et surtout le marché Maisonneuve où l'on trouve tout et de bonne qualité.
Bref : une recommandation 5 étoiles sans hésiter.","10"
"Excellent endroit!  Fort agréable!   Propriétaires disponibles et généreux!","10"
"Excellent hôte Airbnb, tout est adéquat!! fortement recommandé...","10"
"Couldn't have been better. Great location, communication was fast, place is very nice, parking spot is an excellent bonus. I'd stay here again for sure.","10"
"The place is very clean, well-equipped, and organized.  The host is very friendly and prompt on communication; ensuring we feel comfortable and welcome.  We like the electronic key lock so we don't have carry a key.  Also, it has parking on-premise which is very useful.  It is about 15 min drive to downtown which is easy and quick.  We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to others!","10"
"Très bon accueil. William a été très accommodant concernant notre heure d’arrivée. Le réfrigérateur était vraiment bien garni avec petites gâteries fort appréciées. Le lit est confortable. La cuisine bien équipée. Tout est propre et bien rangé. La connexion WI-FI efficace. Divan propre et confortable. Le code d’entrée au lieu de la traditionnelle clé est vraiment fonctionnel. Accès au métro en cinq minutes. Très belles ruelles fleuries à emprunter pour se rendre sur la rue Ontario.","10"
"Excellent place. Very clean. Well kept. Close to transportation. Excellent hosts.","10"
"The place was nice and clean. The setup was comfy and made me felt like home (and much better). Sue wrote many tips and notes to help us get familiar with the utilities, and she also left treats(cookies and muffins) for us. They reply to our message very promptly and accommodate our last minute change generously. Location is away from downtown area, but only 5min walk to metro (subway) which makes transportation convenient. Highly recommended.","10"
"This is a wonderful location and a really nice apartment! I am really excited to return to Montreal again soon. Everything you need is in the apartment and it looks amazing!","10"
"My wife and 13 year old son drive from CT to Montreal for the busiest weekend of the year: the Grand Prix du Montreal (F1).  Sue and William were absolutely phenomenal hosts and made us feel at home.  Blueberry muffins on the counter, a fully stocked refrigerator, air conditioning, and very attentive to all of our many questions.  Metro was an easy walk from the condo and there was parking for our car in the driveway.  I travel frequently, but will stay with Sue again when next back in Montreal.  What a pleasure!","10"
"We stayed for four nights in William and Susan's upstairs apartment. Their place is a delightful little gem! Plenty of space and privacy for three of us. The entire apartment was spotless, nicely furnished and everything in it was very good quality, which we appreciated because it felt like home. 

Susan greeted us when we arrived and was accessible by text if we needed anything. There were muffins, cookies and a homemade baguette waiting for us when we arrived and the kitchen was fully stocked. The neighborhood was quiet and very close to the Jardin Botanique where we were working. 

We wouldn't hesitate to book again and highly recommend this perfect apartment to anyone staying in Montreal. 

","10"
"nous avons reçu un excellent accueil, beaucoup d attention de la part de notre hote, je le recommande vivement","10"
"Very clean and well maintained.  They were quick to respond to any questions that we had.  Would definitely recommend this place.","10"
"This is an exceptional property. It is an excellent value and just so inviting! This was our first Airbnb experience, and I would not hesitate to do this again! We received a friendly greeting from Sue when we arrived. There was a designated parking space which is a huge deal if you are at all familiar with Montreal. We were so excited noticing all the special touches when we arrived. Everything is very neat and professional. There are little typed notices for how to work things, the wifi code, and the lovely homemade snacks on the table (which were awesome). The unit is immaculate. I cannot stress that enough. It is truly immaculate. Everything has been recently upgraded. The linens are wonderful and soft. William and Sue have thought of everything! There are condiments, coffee and emergency food supplies, a hair dryer, a sewing kit, a first aid kit - I mean, really, they have thought of everything. I would not hesitate to return to L'Ideal, and I would not hesitate to recommend it. My only disappointment was that we were only able to stay for two nights. I easily could have lived there! ","10"
"Our stay was great. The apartment is well stocked and hosts were very gracious and hospitable. Would not hesitate to stay with them again or recommend them to a friend.","10"
"We stayed here for Comic con and while we drove into Downtown Montreal, it was only a 2 minute walk to the subway. The apartment was incredibly clean and well stocked with anything we could have needed. The area was quiet and within walking distance to the Biodome/Botanical Gardens. We appreciated all the little touches. Sue and William were on hand for any questions we might have had, but were not intrusive. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.","10"
"A great apartment for a stay in Montreal It is just a few minutes walk from the metro station. The house is well equipped with everything you need to enjoy your stay. The hosts were very nice and friendly and even left us sweet home baked treats and a freezer with breakfast food. The house is super clean and comfortable modernly decorated . We will definitely stay there in the future. 
Thanks for everything! 
We loved our stay! ","10"

Full size fridge in nice kitchenette. Homemade cookies and muffins as well. Quality linens. I felt quite spoiled. ","10"
"Appartement très bien équipé, très propre, très confortable, situé à environ 200 m du métro, avec une place pour garer la voiture. Nous avons très bien été accueillis par Suzanne et des petits muffins et cookies avaient été préparés à notre intention pour le petit déjeuner. Thé, café et d'autres aliments à notre disposition dans le frigo et le congélateur. Le logement dispose d'une climatisation et d'un petit balcon. William est adorable, très prévenant. Bref, une très bonne expérience pour nous (couple + ado de 14 ans). Merci William ! Corinne M.","10"
"The apartment looks even better in person! It was very clean and our host was very accommodating to our needs. I will surely come back here if I return to the city.","10"
"L'ideal was the perfect Airbnb experience, William and Susan provided us with everything we needed to feel comfortable and home away from home!","10"
"What a fantastic apartment. Beautifully set out and perfect for a family of four. It was a short metro ride from the centre/tourist areas and in a quiet residential area near the Olympic Park. The boys lovely the freshly baked muffins and cookies and they didnt last long. Would definitely recommend this as a place to stay in Montreal.","10"
"Je conseille l'emplacement proche du métro ou bus. C'est moderne, fidèle au photos, et très propre. L'accueil des propriétaires est chaleureux.","10"
"Un appartement superbe, proche du jardin botanique, du métro, nous avons découvert Montréal en famille avec beaucoup de plaisir. William est attentif à ce que nous ne manquions de rien. Nous recommandons cet endroit sans hésitation!","10"
"Excellent emplacement, à 2 minutes à pied du métro et du stade olympique. Accueil sympathique et personnalisé, tout est bien réfléchi et fourni. Propre, tranquille et douillet. Je recommande fortement.","10"
"Best Airbnb experience ever! William and Sue clearly put in a lot of thought into preparing the apartment for their guests - everything that one could possibly need while traveling was provided including shower essentials, some basic food staples (milk, cream, eggs, coffee, even some frozen snacks), and an abundance of towels. They had even provided very delicious homemade treats! The neighborhood was quiet and the apartment was clean and spacious (even for four people -- the sofa bed is quite comfortable). I strongly recommend staying at William's and Sue's and I will definitely book this apartment again the next time I'm in Montreal :)","10"
"Great!","10"
"appartement conforme à la description. Très propre. Literie  très confortable. 
A 2mn du métro, puis 15mn du centre en métro (sans changement).
Cuisine bien aménagée, Appartement calme.
Les wc sont dans la salle de bain ce qui la rend un peu petite.
Nous avons passé un très bon séjour.","10"
"My wife and I stayed here for only one night and Its truly one of the best airbnb stays we've ever experienced!  The hosts were on hand on arrival and so pleasant and helpful with directions and ideas of things to do. The apartment is a five minute walk to the Olympic stadium and underground metro system. Also bars and restsurants within 10 minutes walk (le blind pig and tannerie were very good!)  It's such a nice place to stay with absolutely everything you could need AND more! Basic provisions in the fridge which were most welcomed after a long drive.  Comfy bed. Excellent wifi.  Small balcony to sit outside. We will definitely be coming back next time we're in Montreal and stay for longer,  thank you both for your kindness and hospitality!","10"
"Me and my daughter had the fantastic time staying at William's place. There were many things prepared: snacks, basic ingredients to cook, some juice, and there even were homemade cookies. The house was VERY clean, everything was well organized. We could get immediate response for the things we asked for. The house was 2 minutes walk from the subway, which was a good thing. We hope that we could stay at William's place when we have the chance to go back to Canada.","10"
"We absolutely loved our stay at William and Sue's place! It was spacious, bright, very clean, and in a lovely neighbourhood. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome! It is close to the Botanical Gardens and the Metro - very easy to get around! We will definitely be back!","10"
"Séjour agréable chez un hôte très sympathique et dans un appartement confortable et très propre disposant de toutes les commodités.
Rien n'a manqué pour que notre séjour se passe dans de bonnes conditions.
Je recommande vivement!!","10"
"Very pleasant experience with the host.  William and Sue were very courteous and friendly as well as providing us with helpful guidance and recommendations during our stay.  The apartment is extremely clean and has all the amenities that you need readily available.  They also provided some homemade baked goods which were truly delightful.   Highly recommended.","10"
"Attractive, comfortable and very clean apartment located near attractions  (Jardin Botanique, Insectarium, Biodôme, Planétarium and Stade Olympique).  It is a few minutes walk from the subway station.  The apartment is located on the second floor of a house at the corner of Bourbonnière and Pierre-de-Coubertin.  
Communications with William and Sue were prompt and informative.  The check-in and check-out were very easy.  I appreciated the welcoming muffins and cookies, in addition to the basic foods left in the fridge and kitchen cupboards.  
Both William and Sue were welcoming and hospitable making the stay most comfortable and enjoyable.","10"
"Thanks to William and Susan for being so helpful and thoughtful. The survival
kit was fantastic and unexpected of but they gave us a great breakfast treat! The place is marvelous. Super clean and super comfortable. Definitely a place worth staying at when you are in Montreal. Our stay was short but definitely was worth it!","10"
"The place is very nice and clean. William and Sue are great. I would stay here again next time in Montreal.","10"
"I've stayed in many Airbnbs and this one deserves a prize.  Expectations were high with all of the great reviews and everything was just as good, or better, than what the other reviews claim.  The area is quiet and residential, not bustling like downtown Montreal and you need to walk a few blocks for anything, including the subway which is very convenient.   Very close to the botanical garden (+great restaurant) and the impressive Olympic sports center where you can get a day pass for $6.  Will be back!","10"
"Fantastique emplacement! Je suis un utilisateur très régulier de Airbnb, et ce logement m'a completement conquis!

Douillet, bien aménagé, abordable et confortable, il est très bien situe, dans un quartier calme et très près des transports en commun. L'entrée entièrement autonome, extrêmement simple, y est un gros plus.

William et Susan sont des hôtes discrète, charmants mais extrêmement attentionnés et professionnels. Rien n'est laissé au hasard et les petites attentions à l'intérieur sont divines.

Mon nouveau must!","10"
"Situé à 2 minutes de marche de la station de métro, il était facile de ce déplacer au centre-ville. L'appartement était très propre. L'accès facile! Nous nous sentions en sécurité. Même si nous étions en pleine canicule, l'appartement est équipée d'une air climatisé murale et l'air est bien circulé donc nous avons très bien dormi.

Merci encore!","10"
"Had an amazing stay. As other people indicated, super nice extra touches were abound in the place, such as fridge stocked with eggs, milk, Keurig machine with a selection of hot drinks, cereals in the cupboard, and generally the place was very nicely decorated and clean. We had a personal greeting from Sue despite having encountered issues on the way and making us late. Subway was also only just a 5 minute walk away, in a nice feeling neighbourhood. Highly recommended.","10"
"This apartment is perfect. So well equipped and well located, near the Metro and the Olympic stadium area. Loved it,  and was sad to leave. A real home from home and William and Sue are lovely people who made us feel very welcome xxx","10"
"What a wonderful place!  I would highly recommend.  The space was clean, organized, and well prepared for our visit.  The 2 minute walk to the Metro was ideal for getting around Montreal.  William and Susan were excellent hosts.  When in Montreal I would not hesitate to book again.","10"
"This was my first time using Airbnb so I was not sure what to expect. Susan and William absolutely blew me away with their hospitality and kindness. We drove in a bit late into Montreal but Susan came out to greet and welcome us. The apartment was extremely clean and organized. There was coffee available, cupboards and fridge had food for our disposal and the nicest touch was the homemade bakery items and crepes. There was also a private parking spot available for our car, which was appreciated. If we had any questions or concerns, Susan would respond within minutes and would ensure the problem is taken care of on the spot. When we come to Montreal in the future, we will most definitely book this apartment again instead of going to a hotel!","10"
"This is an extremely clean and well-kept accommodation.  You will find all the usual amenities plus more, such as a refrigerator stocked with eggs, homemade jam, milk, margerine, and condiments, etc.  You are greeted by an array of home baked muffins and cookies. Communication was easy and excellent when we had a problem with the cable service.  William and Susan were there in a flash to help us out.  This one bedroom apartment is in an ideal location for walking to the Botanical Gardens, Olympic stadium, and Biodome, and has easy access to the metro and bus service.  Very quiet...like a little oasis in the city of Montreal.","10"
"We recommend William and Susan’s Place to anyone traveling to Montreal!!
The hosts are delightful, the place is immaculate, beautiful, comfortable, and VERY well-equipped. They obviously take great pride in offering an exceptional experience  to their guests. 
In addition, the location is excellent - situated in a quiet tree lined neighborhood, very close to the metro which is very clean and efficient. In addition, the wonderful Olympic Park is close by with its gorgeous botanical gardens and much more.  We felt very comfortable strolling around the area. 
A good grocery store and casual dining spots are nearby; very convenient!
Truly an A-Plus choice!!","10"
"Pour preuve de notre satisfaction, c'est la seconde fois que nous séjournons à l'idéal.

L'appartement a vu son équipement amélioré (clim, aspirateur Dyson, etc.). Et il y a toujours les gâteaux (maison) de bienvenue ainsi que deux/trois bricoles dans le frigo pour la survie des premiers instants (pouvoir se faire un bon café sans avoir à faire les courses tout de suite, par exemple).

Bref un chouette condo, chez des chouettes gens. Allez-y en confiance. Mais pas lorsque nous y retournerons nous-même;-)","10"
"This condo was immaculate, with many nice amenities and touches, and in a great location. Highly recommended! I look forward to returning for a longer stay some time! Miles","10"
"Probably the best airbnb I have been to, and I've been to quite a few entire apartment airbnb's. William and Sue were great hosts. We arrived late at night and Sue walked out in the rain and freezing weather to make sure we were able to get in safely. They also left homemade treats and some food in the fridge! 

As for the apartment, it's located very close to the metro station so we had no trouble accessing the city at all. The apartment was pretty much spotless. Sheets smelled clean, every room was very clean. I was very happy with my stay here and would absolutely recommend. You won't regret it! ","10"
"Fantastic stay, and the hosts thought of everything! Honestly could not ask for a better experience :)","10"
"I enjoyed a comfortable and restful stay at William and Susan’s cozy, immaculate apartment. The cleanliness, amenities, and warm personal touches made me feel immediately at home. The thought and care that they put into creating a welcoming space were evident throughout. As hosts, they showed the perfect blend of attentiveness, warmth, and professionalism that made our communications and interactions pleasant and easy.

I appreciated having a fully equipped kitchen and staple pantry items such as pasta for complimentary use. (Groceries at Marche Maisonneuve were a quick ride away on the 139 bus from Pie-IX station.) The sparkling new appliances and furnishings and modern heating system made for a comfortable, problem-free stay in late-November temperatures.  Entering and exiting the apartment was safe and easy, with the keyless lock system in place.

Thoughtful touches included plentiful linens, spare umbrellas in the closet, and various toiletry/personal care items available for use. Susan checked in regularly to make sure our stay was going well.

The location was convenient: easy access to the center of the city, but removed enough for a quiet retreat from the bustle. I enjoyed catching a glimpse of everyday life in the residential Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood. (College de Maisonneuve, literally across the street, serves post-high school/pre-college students, coming and going throughout the day.)

Staying at L’Ideal on our first trip to Montreal and as our first use of Airbnb was a choice I was glad to have made. I look forward to returning to Montreal (am now very much a fan) and staying here again.","10"
"Wow!  I am a very picky person and not easily impressed, but staying at this Airbnb exceeded all my expectations!  Everything was exactly as promised.  Communication and information was precise, great location, off-street parking, private entrance and the apartment was exceptionally clean and updated.  William and Sue even provided homemade treats and stocked many basics such as coffee, milk and more.  They were friendly and attentive while still respecting one's privacy.  Great hosts and a great service - I would definitely stay again!  Thanks William and Sue.","10"
"Second time at Will & Sue's was just as wonderful as the first. The little snacks she leaves are real nice touch for a true b&b experience. Place is perfect and the hosts are there for you when you need them late on new years and can't find any food. But they give you plenty of space. Really feels like home away from home. Can't thank you guys enough!","10"
"Cet endroit est un must ...","10"
"William and Susan were amazing! The place was perfectly located for our needs and we really could not have asked for more. They were attentive, caring and professional. They answered every question quickly, we’re always available for communication and the place was beautiful, full of thoughtful details. We really can’t say enough good things! Would absolutely recommend!","10"
"William’s apartment is charming and it’s the cleanest house I ever rented.  

Ils ont inclu une touche spéciale et sont d’une gentillesse et disponibilité incroyables.

Un vrai bijou.  The place to rent in Montreal 

Merci énormément","10"
"Je ne dirai qu'une chose, laissez-vous tenter par ce logement, vous ne serez pas déçu.","10"
"Beautiful and comfortable accommodations!  And we were welcomed with tasty treats.  Communication was clear; check-in and check-out was a breeze.  Would highly recommend to any couple visiting the area.","10"
"We loved our time at William and Susan’s place, it was hard to even leave to explore Montreal because it was so welcoming and relaxing—so tempting to stay in and nap! It was very very clean, stylish, and had lots of thoughtful touches-including some baked goods. The location was great, short walk to metro and just a described, downtown within minutes by the metro! When we come back to Montreal we will definitely stay here again! Nothing bad to say and nothing to improve on, everything was wonderful! Great at communicating and giving us recommendations!","10"
"Quelle belle expérience.  Un accueil chaleureux, un endroit équipé de tout ce que tu peux avoir besoin pour un séjour des plus agréables.  N’oublions pas de mentionner que l’endroit est d’une propreté impeccable.    Nous avons même eu droit à quelques gâteries faites maison.  (Muffins, biscuits)   Le fait que leur gîte est à deux pas d’une bouche de métro rend notre séjour encore plus plaisant.   Je n’hésiterai aucunement à y retourner ou encore à le référer à un ami ou à qui veux bien l’entendre.","10"
"It will be definitely my first recommendation to all my friends who plan to visit Montreal. It has everything that you are looking for: great hospitality, super cleanliness, and super easy public transportation!!","10"
"This place was great. Cozy, clean, minutes from metro, short walk from the lively Ontario street. 

We stayed in and cooked, and the kitchen had everything we needed and more (flour, milk, coffee..) we felt like home. Really appreciated! Thanks again William!","10"
"Tout est impeccable, bien localisé et hôtes attentionnés","10"
"Très belle appartement, parfait pour des activités près du stade.","10"
"Brilliant apartment. Brilliant hosts. Very convenient for travel. Cannot recommend highly enough. Did not have a great deal of contact with William and Sue as we were out every day, but were very aware that they were there if we needed them. Cannot praise the apartment and our welcome enough.","10"
"Super close to the Metro and Botanical Gardens! Very cute!","10"
"Des hôtes qui méritent grandement leur « Super host ». Une valeur sure, un quartier génial avec accès facile à la ville, de petites attentions qui font toute la différence et la propreté impeccable des lieux : je n’ai que de bons mots. Vraiment, j’y retournerais n’importe quand. Merci!","10"
"Cet appartement est comparable au suite offerte dans les hôtels mais à moindre prix. De plus, cette appartement nous permet de vivre une expérience touristique extraordinaire afin de se «mêler» à la population.  De plus, avec la station de métro à moins de 5 minutes à pied, nous sommes en pleins cœur du centre-ville en moins de 15 minutes.  Sincèrement, WOW. À vivre et revivre.","10"
"Parfait endroit, l’arrivée est très bien organisée et tout est fait pour bien vous accueillir, un endroit où aller les yeux fermés","10"

Très bel accueil de William et Suzan qui sont venus m’accueillir à mon arrivée et avait laissé de petites gâteries dans l’appartement même si mon séjour n’était que d’un seul jour.

"A superior sweet home just a block away from the Botanical Garden, Olympic Park and the Biodôme. Few minutes walk to the nearest metro station and fantastic Poutine Centrale. Susan and William gave us the warmest welcome and helped us to find a parking lot so we could leave our car for a whole day. The room was tidy, clean and spacious with whatever-you-need and cute decorations. Just a small tip that you may wanna bring your own bathing things as they only have basic toiletries.","10"

Apartment is very near the Botanic Garden and the Olympic stadium, as well as 2 or 3 blocks from the Subway/Metro.
Hosts care and hospitalitty were great, probably one of the best hosts I had in Airbnb.

"Susan and William were wonderful hosts and were very responsive and helpful. A great charming place to stay!","10"
"L'acceuil chaleureux, les touches d'attention, la déco, la propreté ont fait tout une différence et nous donnons 5/5. Même si le logement se situe dans un coin de rue, c'est relativement tranquil et le métro n'est pas loin à pied. Nous aurions aimé que la salle de bain soit un peu plus grande mais néanmoins elle reste propre et fonctionnelle.","10"

We were also conveniently located a short walk to the metro and the Olympic Center. Additionally, we really appreciated the free parking and the extra time Susan and William took to greet and welcome us and to help us navigate the city.

"We had a great stay at William and Susan's place. Our hosts greeted us on arrival and answered any questions we had (such as location to nearest metro). We were able to park our large Honda Odyssey van in the space in the back alley. The code access to the building and apartment is very convenient (no need to carry any keys). Access is a walk around to the front, take 5-6 steps to the front door and inside are additional steps to your apartment. We enjoyed the very spacious interior which has a separate living room (with tv), one queen-size bed in the bedroom, a bathroom, and a kitchen (with full-size fridge and stove) and dining room. The place is cute and immaculately clean! We enjoyed the special touches such as the cookies, muffins and beverages. I highly recommend anyone to stay here. ","10"
"Lovely flat, beautifully clean. Communication was fast and helpful, and the pastries and supplies they left for us were a lovely touch. We would definitely stay again","10"
"Great place, very clean and welcoming! 2 minutes from the subway station. Check in is very easy and flexible. I will definitely check if the place is available next time I am travelling to Montreal.","10"
"Excellent place to stay! Sparkling clean and cozy. This Airbnb also provides beyond normal supplies such as bottled waster, milk, cream, eggs and muffins etc. Which saved me a trip on the first day to do the grocery shopping. Susan is very hospitable and easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend her place.","10"
"Over the last several years I've stayed in AirBnB places in Toronto and Montreal, and this was my mom's first AirBnB experience. We greatly valued the cleanliness and lovely spacious apartment, as well as the many thoughtful touches (e.g., hair dryer, cleaning supplies, keypad lock, appliance instructions, glasses cleaner, home-made baked goods, stocked fridge). I also enjoyed getting a local experience being close to the Olympic Park and exploring Hochelaga- Maisonneuve. The hosts greeted us upon arrival in person and were very responsive to questions. The neighborhood was peaceful, and a convenience store and metro station were easy to access. I had previously stayed in Old Montreal 5 years ago, and I liked this experience better. I'd happily return to your place!","10"
"This a charming apartment, exactly as described and more.  Clean, close to metro, comfortable bed and many extra touches, including some homemade baking, and lots of basic food amenities. Also we arrived in Montreal during a “Heat Warning” and it was wonderful to walk into a lovely cool apartment.","10"
"William’s place is clean, tidy, and cozy especially after a long day’s drive.  The hosts were very hospitable in ensuring we checked in alright and had provided some snacks and drinks for us in the fridge and kitchen table when we had arrived.  I recommend staying here if you want to stay in a quiet neighbourhood and want a good night’s rest.","10"
"Le logement est très agréable, l'emplacement correspond parfaitement à l'annonce près du métro et les hôtes sont très prévenants, réactifs tout en restants discrets. L'appartement est très propre, bien équipé et nous y avons passé 3 semaines comme chez nous.","10"
"Cet appartement dépasse largement la description et nous avons été très agréablement surprises par la propreté, le niveau d'équipement et la déco. En plus il est très bien situé à 2 min du métro. Mais ce que nous avons le plus apprécié, c'est l'accueil, la gentillesse et la disponibilité tout en discrétion des  hôtes. 
Nous recommandons vivement cette adresse.","10"
"William's place was extra comfortable and exceeded our expectations on all levels. The three of us (all adults) were very comfortable. Everything we needed was provided. They are kind and helpful hosts. Most welcoming. We only stayed two nights but this would be an excellent location for a longer stay. We heartily recommend this place.","10"
"Super clean great location includes parking definitely recommend","10"
"Comfortable, well laid out space with lots of light and everything you need to make a meal and to relax.  For us it was a home away from home.","10"
"This place far exceeded our expectations. The pictures don’t do this place justice. Everything we could have needed was available in the space. Everything was so professional and thought out it was like staying at a 5 star hotel but with the feel of home. The neighborhood felt peaceful and safe. The provided parking space was great and we had plenty of room! There was not a single think lacking here. We only wish we had more time to stay. Thank you Susan for being so prompt in meeting us and suggesting where to go for breakfast. Your passion for  hospitality was so felt by my husband and I.","10"
"Un appartement et un accueil exceptionnel ! Tout y est : propreté, belle decoration, équipements, petites attentions, super literie ! Je recommande ce logement sans hésiter! C'est l'idéal, ni plus ni moins ;)","10"
"C’est ma meilleure expérience Airbnb à ce jour. Les hôtes sont attentionnés et communicatifs. Il y a beaucoup de touches d’attention dans l’appartement. Très bien aménagé contrairement à d’autres appartement qui sont des coquilles vides. Je m’y suis senti comme un invité chez eux. Le stationnement privé est fourni. L’entrée est autonome. C’est près du métro et du Parc Olympique. Je le recommande vivement.","10"
"All round fantastic! both Susan and William checked to see if we had any questions and the flat was beautifully supplied","10"
"We had a great stay here; while the location is closer to the Olympic Park, it is easy to get to other landmarks through Montréal by the green Métro line. We mostly interacted with Susan, who was very responsive to our needs and concerns. The interior here is adequately furnished, and the furniture and fixtures are modern and up to date.","10"
"25$ uber from city centre which was a drag but extremely clean good amenities and service.","10"
"Best airbnb experience I ever had. Place is very clean and close to metro. Host greeted us when we arrived and gave us some local tips. Homemade cookies and muffins, coffee, and some breakfast were provided in the house for convenient! Definitely recommend!","10"
"excellent","10"
"Located outside of downtown,  very close to the Olympic Parc it was very easy to get to (we drove).

Aside from all the standard amenities there were a lot of thoughtful touches like homemade strawberry jam in the fridge as well as some bread, eggs and other staples (oh and  homemade cookies + muffins). Also having many usb outlets was very convenient.

William and Susan were very welcoming and helpful, they even cleared the snow off our car while we were out at dinner.

Great place!","10"
"L'Idéal, c'est carrément l'idéal pour un séjour Montréalais.  À deux pas du métro, quartier tranquille, accueil chaleureux et petites attentions... tout y était pour nous charmer et nous faire passer du bon temps.  Je recommande chaudement ce nid douillet!","10"
"Awesome place. Two blocks from the metro. Parking. Sparkling clean. Stylish. We'd love to return again.","10"
"William and Susan are expert hosts who warmly welcomed us when we arrived and even helped us scrape all the Montreal ice off our car as we headed out ;) The home is clean and full of thoughtful touches and perfectly located next to the metro. We would definitely stay again.","10"
"Impeccable.  Petites attentions, propreté irréprochable, hôte disponible, confort.  On recommande sans hésiter.","10"
"Warm welcome from William. Lots of wonderful little details that contributed to a wonderful stay. Free parking, home made baking on the table and a super comfortable bed. It had a very homey feeling...like visiting your favorite aunt!","10"
"WoW! Quel accueil! William est vraiment charmant. Tout était parfait! Super propre, super bien équipé, excellente literie et plein de belles attentions. Je le recommande  vraiment et nous comptons bien y retourner! Merci encore à William!","10"
"We had a wonderful experience in this place.  The apartment had everything one could want for a stay in Montreal.  The Metro is close as are other activities.  Susan and William were excellent hosts and we highly recommend them.","10"
"Quel gite extraordinaire avec des petites gâteries pour se faire à déjeuner. Des meubles super confortable et des propreté exemplaire.  Des hôtes convivial et un accueil exemplaire.  Le seul regret c'est d'être resté qu'une nuit. Nous y reviendrons au prochain passage à Montréal. Merci William et Susan.","10"

"Logement idéal, propreté irréprochable, bien équipé, nous n'avons manqués de rien
endroit très calme, on y dort très bien, lit très confortable
je recommande","10"
"This place was amazing! Deborah and her flatmate did an amazing job accommodating us throughout the entire trip.  They were very helpful with tips on what to do during the trip and made sure my girlfriend and I had the privacy that we needed, which was also a plus. 

For the location and accessibility of this place, we should have definitely paid higher.  We were located very close in between two train lines 5 min walking distance of that, a strip of clubs, stores, restaurants, etc while being right in the middle of downtown, so the value of this place exceeds expectations.  If you are a peace and quiet person and don't prefer the city life then this location is not for you because it is a non stop party area with plenty to do.

Deborah was even so kind to allow us to check in extremely early, as we had a very early arrival time from the states, which was also very kind and also flexible for checkout, this place exceeded our expectations, thanks again guys! ","10"
"Merci Déborah et Sébastien ! En effet vous êtes des colocs de choc! Merci pour votre disponibilité, votre accueil, vos précieux conseils et surtout votre bonne humeur! Au plaisir de vous revoir! Aurélie, merci de nous avoir permis de découvrir Montréal avec une arrivée dans cette superbe ville tout en douceur!   Elise et Freddy.","10"
"Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de voir Aurélie mais nous avons très bien été accueillis par Déborah ! Logement super bien situé.","10"
"Very nice Air BnB! Communication was very good and the room we had nice. The location of the accommodation is very good, in a walking distance to many sightseeing locations and close to a metro station. Would definitely recommend it.","10"
"Anne was such a warm and bubbly person! It being my first trip to Montréal, I was a little nervous. But, immediately upon meeting Anne all of the nervousness melted away! She even gifted me with delicious baked goods and maps of the area. The flat is only about a minute's walk to the Green line which was super convenient and the area is diverse and relatively quiet which makes for a nice contrast with the harried and noisy downtown areas. I would definitely stay here again and think that I have made a great friend already in Anne! I would recommend 500%.","10"
"Really great place ! Super close to the metro station and many restaurants. Host was amazing with communication and check in was smooth.","10"
"On a passé une merveilleuse experience dans l’appart d’emilie. Endroit magnifique avec beaucoup d’espace et un balcon ensoleillé et tranquille. Emilie est très arrangeante. Merci! On reviendra avec plaisir!","10"
"Super apart bien placé","10"
"Emillie was very kind and hospitable, great stay!","10"
"Appartement tranquille, bien situé c'était parfait !","10"
"I highly recommend Emilie's place. Its super convenient and 10 min drive to downtown. If you are lucky you can find a parking spot right by her apartment. Its clean and comfy.","10"
"Our stay was great! 
Emilie's apartment is the true Montreal experience (I used to live there). The classic walk-up, the original details: hardwood floors and crown mouldings, the quaint balcony to sit and enjoy your morning coffee. Her place is incredibly close to the metro station and the location is incredible, it has all you need for shopping, eating, drinking, sight-seeing, you name it. Emilie was a great host, and it was very easy and quick to communicate. Our check-in was a breeze :)","10"
"Clean and cute space in a beautiful location","10"
"Le logement est idéalement placé pour visiter Montréal.","10"
"Really homey, classic Montreal vibes. Balcony was very enjoyable. The door was a bit of a hassle as well as there was no toilet paper however for the cost it was well worth it! Great location too close enough to pretty much everything but residential enough to find some calm in the city!","10"
"Great place, in a great location. Emilie was quick to respond to any questions.","10"
"Rapport Qualité prix parfait, appartement bien situé (metro et épicerie à 3-4 min) propre et charment.","10"
"Yves was a great host. He kept in near constant touch with me via airbnb and email before our stay, and during our stay was always reachable by cell. He has a beautiful apartment in a great part of the city. Yves was a great host as well. We had a great time talking with and getting to know him during our stay in Montreal. He gave us some great recommendations on places to go and things to do. The next time I visit Montreal, I hope I'll be lucky enough to stay with him again.","10"
"Yves and his friend Nadine were very hospitable.  Communication was spot on.  Upon arrival we were greeted with quality complementary chocolate , red wine, and OJ. The apartment was plenty large for my wife and I.  Location was very convenient as it was one block from the pics and food on st denis, but was also isolated from the late night noise. 

A nice benefit is roof access.  We had a nice brunch on the roof with some take out from one of the local cafes.

I would return again.","10"
"L'appartement d'Yves est super bien placé au coeur du quartiers des spectacles, il y a tout ce qu'il faut autour de chez lui pour profiter de Montreal de jour comme de nuit! Son accueil a été plus que chaleureux, un grand sourir, une super joie de vivre et de quoi faire un copieux petit dejeuner (pain de mie, fruits, jus, ferrero rocher...)!! Aller chez Yves c'est s'assurer un bon séjour à Montreal, en profitant d'un appart ou il y a une vie, après tout c'est ce qu'on aime chez airBnB!! Vous pouvez booker les yeux fermés!","10"
"Yves loft was exactly as he described it, it was clean, tidy, an spacious. He was kind enough to leave food, coffee, drinks, and snacks for us. His place has everything that we needed, and was located in a convienient spot. I would definitely recommend Yves and his loft, and I hope to rent it out again. ","10"
"We had a great stay at Yves' flat.  We booked at the last minute and were unable to get there in time to meet Yves in person (he had a flight to catch), but his communication was excellent and we were able to get into his place with no problem.  The location was great - near the metro, walking distance of Old Montreal, Mont Royal, etc, tons of places to eat on Rue St. Denis and in the surrounding neighborhoods.  His flat itself was just as described and very clean. We would certainly stay again.  ","10"
"Both Yves and his loft were awesome! Met me at the loft, was very communicative. Left wine and chocolates, amongst toiletries and other things for my wife and I.

Fantastic location, about a 1 minute walk to Rue Saint-Denis, full of restaurants/bars and great nightlife. Parking is super easy, two cheap garages in walking distance.","10"
"L'expérience du loft de Yves commence à l'accueuil.  Yves est un hôte très sympatique et sait vous mettre en confiance dès votre arrivée, avec en bonus quelques grignotines, jus, café moulu et vin rouge. Venant moi-même de Montréal, le loft est stratégiquement positionné. Vous êtes à quelques minutes à pied de la station de métro Berri, centre de la ville et des rames de métro.  Vous êtes dans le quartier des spectacles, au coeur de la vie artistique et des terrasses, mais on n'entend aucun bruit malgré la proximité de la dynamique rue St-Denis. Le lit est très confortable, l'endroit TRÈS propre. Vous venez l'été? Ventilateurs et air climatisé garantissent une nuit fraîche.   Le building est très sécuritaire avec un système de clefs moderne avec code à la porte. En bonus il y a un petit café à la sortie de l'immeuble. Fatigué? Envie de voir un film? Le cinéma Quartier latin est à 20 mètres de votre porte.  J'ai enfin trouvé ma place de choix lors de mes visites à Montréal.   Simon D Scott","10"
"I booked the listing last minute on my way to Toronto from Halifax. Yves has made necessary arrangements  to have the keys delivered on a late check in 8pm( Thanks to his charming friend). Although I didn't get a chance to meet him , he welcomed me with chocolate , snacks , and a few drinks . His loft is  bright,spacious and clean; I was intrigued by the beautiful decors, cool artistic pieces and overall flow. I enjoyed the location , close to many book stores , music shops , restaurants , boutiques, transit. In brief , I didn't really have to go past 1km to find everything that I needed.
Yves is a superhost. I highly recommend his place.","10"
"Yves was a lovely host. He made arrangements for us to drop off our bags even though we arrived several hours before check-in, left snacks and drinks, and was overall very gracious during our stay. The place was perfectly clean, spacious, beautiful, and centrally located. It was extremely close to a number of bars and restaurants, as well as the metro and bus stations, not to mention a short walk from Old Port and the rest of downtown Montreal. We would highly recommend this location! Thank you for a wonderful weekend! Best, LeeAnne and Alina.","10"
"location is great and very nice apartment. highly recommended!","10"
"I would highly recommend staying at Yves's apartment. I was traveling in Montreal for the weekend with my girlfriend and Yves was a terrific host: he was very friendly and accommodating in terms of check-in and check-out time, he was very communicative before / during / after our stay, his place was clean and in a very fun area on rue St Denis and he even bought us some snacks & wine so we would feel at home.
","10"
"Yves' places was as beautiful as the pictures and very centrally located! He is a gracious host who is very flexible and accommodating of your needs. We had an awesome time exploring Montreal! Also, his building has an amazing rooftop you can hang out on. Would highly recommend!","10"
"Awesome host.  Great place lots of style and close to restaurants and the village.  Rooftop patio to chill on and watch the sunrise and sunset.  If your a photographer or enthusiast it's worth the price of entry alone.  Merci Yves!","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 128 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"One of the best experience ever! 
Great location and Yves is super nice.
The house itself is very nice and comfortable.
Will contact him again if i need to stay again in Montreal, highly recommended.
Thanks for everything

"Great location. Looks just like the pictures :)","10"
"While we never met Yves, we felt like we got to know him through his personality-filled apartment. It was beautiful and well equipped. He even left us milk and juice! There are good places to eat right out the door and a very affordable parking lot literally on the block. He was easy to communicate with as well. Would stay here again!","10"
"Yves has such a cool space -- sunny, comfortable, and, as many others have pointed out, extremely stylish. 

The location was perfect. Not only was there plenty to do in the neighborhood, but the apartment was very conveniently located with respect to public transit. 

We didn't meet Yves in person, but a neighbor very kindly let us into the apartment. Many thanks to both of them for a lovely stay!","10"
"Hip & cozy apartment, central to Montreal's Latin Quarter.  Comfortable & very clean, would recommend to family & friends, & would be glad to come back again.","10"

"This was my second airbnb experience, but my first for Montreal.  After years of doing hotels, I've decided to use Airbnb when I can.  I've heard great experiences and horrible experiences, so I was apprehensive once again.  I was so pleasantly surprised with Yves's place.  After a few hours of being in someone else living space, I felt very comfortable.  I didn't meet Yves, but check in and entry was very easy and convenient, which is what I need and want.  Great location..just minutes walk to one of the main transit stations.  Very cool location, and very clean, tidy and uncluttered loft with character.  Yves prepares for his guests, which was very welcoming and appreciated..... milk, juice, snacks, tea/coffee, essential toiletries, tourist/travel info, ....and for me wine.  For 4 days, I felt very comfortable in having my own personal space, which surpasses the hotel experience.  Thanks again, Yves","10"
"This was a great place to stay.  The location was in a nice neighborhood and transit was easily accessible.  Ila and Fred were exceptional hosts.  They are booth kind and accepting people who made me feel welcome from the moment I arrived.","10"
"La chambre est conforme à la photo.
Excellent quartier vue sur un magnifique parc avec wifi.

"Notre séjour chez Ilham et Fred s'est très bien passé ! Ils ont été très accueillant et à l'écoute de nos interrogations, la vie avec eux est très agréable ! 

L'appartement est très bien situé, il est à 20mn à pieds de l'UQAM ou 15mn de bus. Le parc Lafontaine est à 10mn à pieds, de même que le metro Papineau et plusieurs bus à moins de 2mn.   

Il y a de nombreux commerces à proximité et la chambre donne sur une rue très calme. Nous avons eu accès à tous les équipements de l'appartement et la chambre était entièrement équipée ce qui est très pratique pour une première arrivée à Montréal. 

Je recommande donc vivement cet endroit, vous y serez très bien!","10"

"Fred is an wonderful host. Everything was perfect.","10"
"Logement très agréable (chambre et reste de l'appartement), très pratique pour un séjour long (je suis resté un mois en toute tranquillité) dans un quartier plein de restaurants et de commerces. Hôte très sympathique et accueillante.","10"
"Pictures do not perfectly capture Frédérique's place. I LOVED staying here. The house is warm and cozy. The decor is carefully picked and Frédérique has done a lot to create a Zen and private room for her guests.

I work remotely so it was important to have an quiet environment where I can work and have high speed connection. Her home provided both.

As a host I enjoyed meeting Frédérique. She is easy going, fun to talk to and is as involved as you want her to be. She was a host when I went to Montreal, and friend when I left Montreal.

I highly recommend staying at her place. It is perfect for solo adventures or a couple.","10"
"Je n'ai pas beaucoup vu Frédérique, mais elle a été très sympathique, disponible et accomodante chaque fois que j'ai eu besoin de renseignements. Merci :)

Concernant le logement, il est comme sur les photos : très agréable, propre, et parfaitement situé. La chambre est grande et la rue est calme, idéale pour travailler ou se reposer.

En résumé, un très bon séjour !","10"

Although I didn't get to meet Frédérique, she was very attentive and accessible via email, and answered any question I had very quickly.  Not sure when i will be back in Montreal, but when I do go, I shall try to stay there again.","10"
"Frédérique's place is lovely- very cute and cosy. Close to public transport, shops and cafes. Really nice neighbourhood and Frédérique is an excellent host!","10"
"Extended my stay because I enjoyed the place so much!","10"
"I am really lucky to have my first airbnb stay at Frédérique's home. Before my arrivals, she always responded promptly and she was very helpful. I went to Montreal for a conference and it was also my first time to be in Canada. Frédérique's home is very stylish and you can tell that she made a great effort to decorate the place.  The most important thing was that she is very generous to share the nice apartment with her guests. I could access the living room, balcony and the well-equipped kitchen. The oven, washing machine and dryer were new and they were functioning very well. There are also two lovely cats. After a whole day conference, it was really nice to relax with the cats and some nice homemade food and local wine. I also love the brunch place Frédérique showed me. The food was so delicious. I will definitely reserve Frédérique's place if I ever go to Montreal again and I will also recommend this place to my friends who are going to Montreal.","10"
"While we didn't get a chance to meet Frédérique, she was communicative throughout our stay and answered questions we had. The apartment is a short walk from the Métro, a grocery store, and several restaurants and cafés. Overall, a great stay.","10"

"Our stay at Monica's and Edi's place was very nice. The apartment is located between two major streets which was great for shopping and good places to eat. Public transit also close by. The apartment itself is a good size, perfect for three people, clean and bed was very comfortable. We planned on cooking some of our meals but realized the oven was not working so only stove top meals would work. The other appliances are very outdated but for the most part, functional. Bathroom is also outdated and we were only given two bath towels even though there were 3 guests. Check in and check out was easy and Monica responded immediately to any questions that I had. Overall we had a great time and would recommend this apartment. ","9"

"Great place. Good for 2 people. The person who was supposed to pick us up as recommended by Monica couldn't do so at the last minute anyway Uber to monica's place is about 35 cad. The apartment is fully equipped. You have everything u need there. Recommend to wash before using the kitchen utensils. U can request for a laundry card to do n your laundry but will have to top up minimum of 10 dollars that will entitle you to about 2 to 3 washes. Monica responds fast.","9"

"Monica and Edi are great host! Would definitely recommend staying with them. Also they do put two Ferrero Rocher on your towels! Monica responds very fast and is very accommendating.","9"
"Location and communication were superb!!!! They were super accommodating, prompt and kind. Apartment was a bit dirty, and kitchen not very useable ie. no paper towels, limited pots, utensils etc. Pillows were old. Laundry facilities were nice to have but the card will cost you $10 then you load it afterwards. Overall an affordable play to stay with great hosts just a bit dirty, outdated and basic.","9"
"Monica's place is small but perfect with everything you need (kitchen, fridge, AC, bed, & sofa). The location is great! It is secure, right in downtown close to the metro, cafes, Tim Hortons etc. Museums are walking distance as well as bars. It also includes a great view of the city. Monica was very accommodating & always quick to respond if we had any questions or issues. Had a great time in Montreal! Merci!! ","9"
"The place was abit smaller than expected but none the less a great place! Especially enjoyed the view and the pool. Its also in a great location if you travel by metro and couldnt ask for better communication!","9"
"This apartment was great for my friends and I having a weekend in the city. It's a good location within walking distance of plenty of restaurants, cafes, and things  to do during the day. The apartment was small as expected, but we weren't in it much so it served its purpose. We paid to park in the garage which was very tight; it has a 6ft clearance and it was more than tricky to drive through. The apartment smelled like cigarettes when we first arrived and the bathroom smelled like spilled milk which was disquieting to say the least. After turning on the AC unit the cigarette smell eventually went away, but the bathroom couldn't be aired out very much.
Overall a decent stay for the price.","9"

"Great small apartment for sleeping close to restaurants and the city center. They have several apartments in the same building so the one in the listing may not be the same one you get; although they’re pretty similar.","9"
"Great location! Close to shops, restaurants and cafes. Easy to walk around. Apartment had two closets for storage. Parking lot can be very narrow at turns and in spaces, you have to be careful getting in and out. The hosts were very easy to reach and always responded quickly!","9"
"Great, well located. Bed might be a bit tight for 2, but otherwise fine.","9"
"The best thing about this place is the location. Close to the museums, downtown, shopping, and not far from Atwater Market. Very clean and great value for someone who needs a place to crash while visiting Montreal.","9"
"Tiene una excelente ubicación hacia todo lo que debes conocer en Montreal. La calidad del alojamiento es muy buena y Edi está siempre atento a lo que puedas necesitar. Sin duda lo utilizaré cuando vuelva a esa bella ciudad. 
Gracias Edi!","9"

"Fiquei encantada com a hospedagem de Jessica. Apartamento aconchegante e estiloso. Limpo, organizado e acessível. Recomendo.","9"
"This apartment was great for a group of 3 of us. The apartment was very clean and was nicely set up for our arrival with towels toiletries provided. The apartment overlooks the main street which is full of nightlife and restaurants. With the windows open it could be a  bit noisy, but when they are closed it was very quiet so it was not an issue! Having the metro so close made traveling the city very easy. The biggest challenge was parking, if you plan to have a car your only decent overnight options require you to walk quite a bit. Check - in was very easy I would recommend this apartment for friends or couples looking to enjoy the Gay Village and downtown Montreal.","9"
"great place, very comfortable and clean, and looks just like the photos. ","9"
"Great stay! Apartment was perfect.","9"
"Excellent appartement. Très propre, très commode, très central, à 1min de l'arret de métro. Parfait.","9"
"Great location and lovely suite. If you have a car, the best place to park is under the Grand Bibliothèque.","9"
"Lovely condo, looks exactly like the pictures. We had a great stay. The Sonder team are great communicators. Would definitely stay there again.

Keep in mind it is on St. Catherine in The Village, so there is some street noise. Also, the listing doesn't include parking so be sure to make alternate arrangements as the lot Sonder suggested was unattended and difficult to get a hold of.","9"
"Great location! Very spacious and cute decor. Bars and restaurants steps away and central to tourist attractions. Would definitely stay again.","9"
"My family of 5 (3 teenage daughters) stayed here for our August vacation this year (2017). Great apartment located in the middle of the gay village. Very clean and organized with lots of small restaurants around. The metro stop is on the same block and made getting to the rest of the city very easy.  Great windows and lots of light and views of St. Catherine Street which is pedestrian only in the summer.  Lots of fun. 
There are two long sets of stairs up to get to the apartment so pack lightly.  Also the air conditioner had a hard time keeping the front bedroom cool.","9"
"Nice, modern apartment in the heart of the Gay Village. Great amenities and perfect for 2-4 people as the rooms were separated and had everything you need. ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 127 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Good value. The building entrance is a little sketchy but you will be pleasantly surprised with the apartment itself! Sonder was very responsive and addressed all of the (relatively minor) issues we had.","9"

"Super airbnb!","9"
"Had an amazing mid semester break here at sonders! The host was very responsive and helpful with the few issues we had. Other than that I recommend this place! Very close to the night life and local attractions. Food was very close by, including  a 24 hr convince store and liquor store! The sonders was very clean and up to date. The kitchen was fully loaded making cooking fun!","9"

"great location in middle of gay village where there are few hotels. Beaudry subway station one block away but currently closed for renovations until June 2019 (other stops a reasonable 7-8 block walk).  3rd floor unit faces St Catherine St and may be a little noisy for light sleepers (esp on weekends) but not a problem for me.  very roomy kitchen and main area, but bedrooms a little small.","9"

"Place
Wonderful apartment, spacious, clean, fully equipped, comfortable, decorated with taste, bright, quiet, ... And for such a small price. Best value at that price point
Location
Outside center of Montreal, yet close to everything. 5-10min walk to green line subway station, 1min walk to line 107 bus stop, 10min subway to old Montreal, nice walk along the river just next to the apartment, market on street corner, bakery 5min walk away... Perfect for a romantic stay
Hosts
Nice, available yet discrete, helpful.

Thanks Lucia and Emma, this was truly an amazing stay (and thank you for the extra coffee :))

I would 100% recommend this place","10"
"Communicating before arriving in Montreal was very easy and accommodating. I travel to Montreal for school and so coordinating times and keys always gets a little tricky but Lucia and Emma helped for a smooth transition into school life. I grew up in NDG and just love seeing the transformation of Verdun- such a fun place to hang out!","10"

"This apartment is the best experience. It is so clean, excellent beds (and I am very picky), linens, etc. Bathroom remodel was updated in very modern appeal. Kitchen was very well stocked. Had very nice special little touches that shows the detail and care the owners put into it. From the bottled water, to the great coffee, the organic teas, and teapot. Just a wonderful, comfortable, warm feeling to the place. Updated bathroom, kitchen, washer dryer, wi-fi, mixed with a taste of refinished hardwood floors, and EXCELLENT firm beds. I highly recommend this to be your 1st choice. Thank You Lucia & Emma for making us feel at home. ","10"
"The space was equipped with everything you need for a great stay in Ottawa. Its location allowed us to explore the sights and experience multiple parts of Ottawa.","10"

"The apartment was very clean and cozy. It's well connected (we didn't mind walking 10 min from the metro station). The area is quite and there are shops nearby. There is everything needed in the apartment. All in all it was a great stay and it probably would be even more valuable for 2 couples.","10"

"Lucia & Emma's place is absolutely lovely! And I cannot believe what a good deal it is! Everything has been recently updated and was designed very tastefully. The kitchen is fully furnished if you want to cook there (although during our stay the oven wasn't working, but the stovetop was), coffee is provided, there's a washer and dryer in the unit (with detergents provided!), the living room was lovely although the tv didn't have a DVD player. The bedrooms were wonderful - comfy beds and full size mirrors and hanging racks in both. Even a clothes steamer. The bathroom was lovely too - best shower we've had all trip! Amazing water pressure and soft towels. Basically, lots of attention to details made this stay just perfect! And the host was very kind and easy to work with. Communication was easy, although not excessive, and she made sure we had everything we needed. Isn't the ideal location in the city if you want to walk to attractions, but you could tell that by a map. We knew that going in, but it was such a good deal and cozy stay it was worth it for sure!","10"

Their flat is incredibly clean, spacious and well organized and has all the necessary kitchen, bathroom, laundry, and bathroom amenities.  It is also very well-situated, within easy walking distance of the St. Lawrence River and with very easy public transit access by bus or metro to downtown and points north, south, and east.  An incredible value!  Lucia and Emma are very welcoming, communicative, and accommodating hosts. Will certainly stay with Lucia and Emma the next time I visit Montreal.","10"

All the touches are there to make for a lovely stay- comfortable, quiet bedrooms, kitchen equipped for a brewed coffee or cooking up a storm, clean sleek bathroom.

"Lovely, clean and comfortable 2nd floor townhouse flat.  Need to be able to climb the winding external stairs (very common in this neighborhood).  Enjoyed the full kitchen for morning coffee and DIY breakfast before heading out for the day.  Great location - just ""outside the city"" enough to enjoy quiet evenings, but a few steps from the bus stop to the metro for ease of access anywhere else.  Bank for ATM just down the street, along with lots of restaurants, and a fresh fruit vendor on the corner.  Get yourself a transport pass and enjoy Montreal!","10"

Un petit balcon permet de profiter de l'extérieur. L'appartement est bien équipé et propre. Le bruit des travaux dans la rue d'à côté nous ont obligés à nous lever tôt ! L'avantage est que nous avons profité à fond de nos 3 journées à Montréal. Nous recommandons ce logement.","10"
"Großartiges Appartment, mit super Küche, genialem Balkon. WLAN 1a. Ruhige Lage, super Einkaufsmöglichkeiten um die Ecke. Montreal ist gut mit dem Auto zu erreichen. Netter Spielplatz 2 Minuten zu Fuß und von dort auch Spazier- und Radweg am Fluß entlang. Wir würden dort immer wieder absteigen.","10"
"This apartment was quiet and convenient to the Metro station. We enjoyed the fluffy towels and pristine bed linen. We need to return to Montreal to finish exploring after having down day because of sickness.

Emma even came up to shovel snow off the balcony for us. Overall a wonderful stay. Thank you girls!","10"
"It's a beautiful place, the neighborhood is nice. There's a little gourmet market only a few meters from house that is amazing to have a high quality of supplies for dinner and something to drink. The transportation is good and easy to get in daily hours. We can really recommend the place to enjoy Montreal.","10"
"깨끗하고 쓸모있게 관리되는 숙소임. 
그릇이나 요리에 필요한 도구도 기본적으로 충분히 갖춰져 있고 세탁실또한 잘 관리되어 지내는 동안 충분히 편리했고 침구도 깨끗하고 숙소 상태에 비해 가격도 비싸지 않았음. 다음번에 이지역으로 여행을 온다면 숙소로 충분히 고려해 볼만해요. 또한 호스트들도 충분히 친절했으며 폭설이 오는 날씨에도 빠르게 출입구와 계단의 눈을 치워주어서 편안하게 생활했어요. 다음번에 또 간다면 이용하고 싶은 숙소입니다.","10"

"This is the second time I stayed at Emma's place, and it was again a wonderful experience.  Emma is a very warm and generous host, is very responsive, and communicates very well.  The flat is very spacious (2 bedrooms) and well-organized, very clean, and very much as advertised (""bright, cozy, quiet"").  The location, with easy access to public transit (both bus and metro) to get downtown or around southwest Montreal and also being a short walk from the St. Lawrence River and its walk/bike pathway, can't be beat.  Given all of these positives, it is also a great value.  I will always stay here when visiting Montreal if Emma's flat is available.","10"
"Spacious, clean, cozy apartment. Enjoyed it very much. Good base to see the city from, either by car (there is parking in front) or subway (walking distance from station). Quiet residential neighbourhood. The only thing worth noting if someone has accessibility needs is that there is a bit a steep staircase to reach the apartment. It worked out well for us and would stay here again. ","10"

"Ce logement est bien aménagé et équipé, très clair et agréable à vivre. La terrasse est particulièrement sympathique. Le lit est confortable ainsi que le canapé.
Les bords du Saint Laurent sont très proches et apaisants, le métro Verdun est à 15 mn à pied mais un bus le rejoint. Une épicerie pleine de produits tentants est au coin de la rue.
Emma a su répondre aux petits problèmes rencontrés avec rapidité et efficacité. Il est très facile de la joindre et d'échanger avec elle.","10"
"L’appartement est lumineux spacieux, très propre situé dans un quartier très calme et à proximité de toutes commodités (bus, métro, commerces, station service...)

"Our stay in Emma’s apartment was nice. Spacious, cosy! I fell in love with her coach:). It would have been 200% top experience if the housemaid had cleaned the appartement properly before we arrived. My mother-in-law is very sensitive to cleanliness .We contacted Emma and she reacted quickly and fixed this issue the day after . Emma is easy to contact, even if she lives in the apartment downstairs she is very discrete. She is easygoing and have good advices on what to do in Montreal. Anyway for the rest we really enjoy our stay and felt comfortable. I recommend this place. Perfect for couples or small families.","10"
"This apartment is spacious, bright, modern and clean.  The fans were very helpful to keep us cool at night.  Laundry was also a convenient addition, and there is even a steamer for any formal wear.  The kitchen is well stocked with everything you'd need to make a few meals, and there is a little produce market on the corner.  A nice walk to Verdun Metro station although wouldn't do this alone at night.  The neighbors were very friendly.  Loved the iconic outdoor spiral staircase, although I imagine this is tough in winter.  Will be recommending this place to friends.  Its quite a bargain for exploring the neighborhoods of Montreal.  ","10"
"Emma is a great host! Her apparment is nice, cosy, clean and located in a nice neighbourhood. There is a great small grocery store at the next corner and a very nice breakfast place two blocks away. There are also a lot playgrounds 10 min away (walking distance) right next to the water, what we really appreciated. We traveled with our two kids (4 and 2) and even they got up very early (jetlag) there where no complaints. Thanks for that and sorry again! We enjoyed our stay very much! ","10"

Emma's communications were quick and warm.  Shovelling the snow off of the outside staircase and salting the steps was greatly appreciated. My next trip to Montreal I hope the space is available.","10"

"We enjoy our stay in Nicole' s apartment I outermost.  Very nice neighborhood.  Convenient for us, as close to where our son with family lives.  Apartment is nice, well equipped, a bit funky but comfortable.  Our hostess was most gracious and accommodating.  A couple of drawbacks for some people. We had hoped to  have  a queen size bed, which did not happen. And if you have trouble walking up 32 steps, it may not be for you.  All in all, a nice place to stay.

"Nous avons beaucoup aimé rester un mois dans ce bel appartement avec un jardin. Nous étions deux, très à l'aise dans ce grand espace, avec une belle cuisine, un salon confortable,  deux grandes chambres et une super salle de bain. L'appartement a été rénové et est tout neuf. Il est très bien situé, à côté des bons commerces de nourriture et un bon café. Il est très calme, avec le jardin qui donne dans une ruelle verte. Martine est très à l'écoute et nous avons été contents de la rencontrer.","9"

"Dan was a great host and did everything possible to make my check-in and stay as smooth as possible. The room was exactly as pictured. It's only a few steps from the Metro which is a real convenience when it's cold and snowy. It was my first experience with Airbnb, and it was a good one.","9"
"Infelizmente não foi boa minha estadia no apartamento do Daniel. Apesar da localização ser excelente o apartamento não acomoda 3 pessoas apenas casal . Fomos eu , meu marido e minha filha de 15 anos e o apartamento apresenta apenas 1 cama de casal e a terceira acomodação era um colchão de inflar que estava furado. Imediatamente comunicamos o Daniel sobre o ocorrido e ele demorou 12 horas para nós responder e exigiu foto do colchão furado para verificar a veracidade da informação. Como era véspera de feriado de Natal nos informou que não poderia comprar um novo nem emprestar um outro colchão e que tínhamos má sorte . Ficamos lá por mais três dias nos revezando eu e minha filha num sofá de 2 lugares para não dormirmos no chão em pleno inverno canadense. Além disso não havia lavadora nem secadora de roupas como no anúncio. Recomendo o lugar apenas para casais não serve para família e Daniel não é um anfitrião confiável. ","9"

"Daniel was a great host. Very easy to communicate with and the apartment was spectacular. Everything looks exactly as seen in the pictures. Location is a close walk downtown and our stay was pleasant. 

Thanks for everything!","9"
"The apartment is cute and comfortable and perfectly located and Daniel and his team were exceptionally responsive whenever we had a question, so we were happy with our stay. It's very small, though, so I'm not sure I would recommend it for longterm stays for more than one person, it started feeling a bit cramped a few days into our stay. But for short visits to the city I would definitely recommend it!   ","9"
"Great place and awesome location!","9"
"Everything is good except washroom is too small.","9"
"Great location steps from the metro and St Catherine's shopping and restaurants!","9"
"Very cute place, within steps of the metro station, shopping and restaurants.  It's smaller then it looks in the photos so I think it's best for one or two travelers.  We had 3 and it was a little tight.  Very clean and neat.  Daniel and Diana were very quick with any questions we had.  I had problems using the Kevo app but found, that if you touch the lock, before you try to open/close it, it worked much faster. Would definitely recommend for a couple or single traveler. Thanks again! ","9"
"Great place to stay for two people","9"
"This apartment is in a great location - extremely central and with easy access to  stores, restaurants and public transport. The room was very clean and tidy with no unnecessary clutter of any sort. It's small, cozy and perfect for a lone traveller or a couple/friends who are comfortable sharing a bed, however 3 people would be a tight fit. Daniel was very easy to reach and a great communicator even though we didn't get a chance to meet him in person. He answered all questions and made sure we were comfortable with the check in process. All in all we had a great stay at this apartment - great value in a perfect Montreal location.","9"

"We enjoyed our stay in #203. It was small, but good for a short stay for 2 people. 
Check in was easy and Daniel was easy to reach by email, if needed. 
It was in a great location near lots of restaurants and only a 12 minute walk to the Bell Centre for concerts and sports. The building was noisy at times and we did hear our neighbours and street noise, but overall it was a good price and good location.  ","9"
"Very unique place within a good walking distance to most amenities. The place is fairly small but you won't be spending most of your time indoors so it shouldn't be a big deal. Adding things like a plunger for each bathroom would definitely improve some people's experience because you never know. Also, we had issues with the wifi. It would either not connect or when it was connected, it was fairly sluggish. 

Overall we had a good experience and saved some money in comparison to standard hotel prices in the same area. ","9"

"Ein wirklich sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt!
Alles war wie vorher beschrieben, der Checkin und Checkout funktionierten einwandfrei, sodass man direkt in das Abenteuer starten konnte.
Die Dämmung der Fensterfront ist ist etwas ungünstig bei sehr kalten Temperaturen, wenn man jedoch die Vorhänge benutzt und die Unterseite abdeckt ist es auch bei -15°C eine tolle Wohnung. Die Kommunikation mit Daniel funktionierte sehr gut, auch wenn nicht immer alle Fragen komplett beantwortet wurden. (Was für mich aber definitiv kein Negativpunkt ist ;)  )

Die Lage ist ein perfekter Ausgangspunkt für alle Erkundungen in Downtown!
Für dieses Preis/Leistungsverhältnis eine sehr tolle Wahl und empfehlenswert.

Jederzeit gerne wieder, vielen Dank und alles Gute!","9"

"Daniel’s place is beautiful and a great location as it is close to the subway. The  facility was well maintained and Daniel ensured that we were doing well throughout our trip; he is very responsive. 

The only con I have is that the place is a bit dusty and a tight squeeze for two people especially when doing multiple tasks together. 

Other than that, it is a lovely place to stay and Daniel was an amazing host.","9"

"Good place","9"
"A well-placed, but smallish studio apartment, the location was super convenient being close to the Guy-Concordia train line and meant travel around the city was accessible and easy. With a view to Mont Royal, the not-too-taxing climb from the front door will soon reward you with an exceptional view of the city. The aircon was really welcome on the hot and humid summer nights.","9"

"Daniel was a great host for our weekend stay in Montreal. He was always very quick to reply with help on any questions we had regarding the area, such as finding suitable parking as it can be difficult at times. Daniel was kind to also check up on us mid way of our stay.
The loft itself is a great space for a single traveler or a couple. The area was close to many amazing local attractions and eats of downtown Montreal. We loved that many of these places were within walking distance for the added convenience. Thank you Daniel for hosting!","9"

"I don’t recommend this place. I had a terrible experience","9"
"The host kept in contact and answered all my questions. The self check in was smooth& efficient. The studio was very clean, cozy, had all the necessities, it does have a small bathroom that cannot fit 2 people at the same time but this wasn't a problem for us. The studio is across from a fire station so if you're a light sleeper it may not be the place for you. I do suggest to place a mat to keep all the salt/rocks during the winter seasons! However it was a very good stay!","9"
"Good place,
Great location","9"
"Me and my mother stayed here for 4 days to see a concert at the bell centre. Location is amazing. Perfect place for a weekend away, especially a downtown Montreal shopping trip!","9"
"This was my first time using Airbnb and had a great experience, will definitely use again!  Patrick was a great host, very professional, friendly, and overall a great guy.  The bedroom in which I stayed was very comfortable, there were fresh bed linens and towels ready for my arrival and the host made me feel welcomed. Patrick has a very spacious, nicely decorated apartment, that is in a great neighborhood close to the metro.  The directions on how to arrive to apartment using public transportation was fantastic.  Patrick has a busy work schedule but I was able to enjoy a chat with him and having something to eat together.  Would definitely recommend Patrick as a host to travelers going to Montreal.   ","9"
"Spotlessly clean, cool and very comfortable apartment that is in a nice neighborhood. We felt very lucky to have found such a great place at short notice and Patrick was the perfect host. Easily the best airbnb experience we've had and would highly recommend Patrick and his place to anyone planning a trip to Montreal ","9"
"Patrick and his place were awesome. Great location near a trendy area and very cool, clean and tidy apartment. Very well equipped kitchen. We had fun chilling and chatting with Pat in the evenings - he suggested some awesome things for us to see which really made our time in Montreal! Highly recommended, you da man Pat. ","9"
"It was a lovely apartment in a quiet but lively neighborhood. The room itself is neat and artistic! Patrick is a very nice and considerate landlord.","9"
"We had to cancel our reservation a few days before arrival, which must have been an annoyance to Patrick. However he wished us a great trip, and was very kind about it. ","9"
"Great experience, would totally recommend it to anyone! Patrick is a very friendly and attentive host. He's always willing to give a recommendation about anything Montreal! His stylish apartment is always clean and quiet and close to public transit. His dog is very friendly dog and respectful. Definitely a good experience! ","9"
"J'ai passé un très agréable séjour chez Patrick. Il est une personne ouverte à la discussion et qui est de  bon conseil concernant la ville Montréal et le Québec en général. Son appartement est très  bien situé et très propre. N'hésitez pas à passer un séjour chez lui, vous vous y sentirez comme chez vous.","9"
"Un très bon accueil de Patrick dans une chambre et un appartement très agréables. Merci Patrick et à bientôt!","9"
"Very nice place to stay, I definitively recommend it. The neighborhood is very quiet, easy to park your car in front. Downtown is a bit far by walk (1h at least, Montreal is huge!), but there is a subway station 5mn away and it will take you downtown in 20mn.","9"
"Great host, clean room. Beautiful apartment. Not very central but easy to get places by metro. ","9"
"Gorgeous old apartment with plenty of character in a beautiful neighbourhood, 5 minute walk from metro station. Its a little ways from Downtown Montreal but there are plenty of shops and restaurants around the corner. Patrick is a great host, the bed was very comfy and the apartment was easy to find. Looks exactly like the pictures. Very quiet at night, the dog doesn't make any noise and is very calm.

I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you appreciate heritage homes and woody neighbourhoods. ","9"
"Patrick was a great host! Very helpful in finding things to do in the city, the apartment was very close to the metro and it was easy navigating. The apartment was lovely with a sweet little balcony to enjoy snacks and drinks.  I would absolutely consider returning to Patrick's welcoming home if we should return to Montreal. ","9"
"Patrick was an excellent host, and it couldn't have been a better first experience with airbnb. The house and the room was very clean and the dog was very tame. Also, the location was ideal to arrive with car, because you have the possibility to park in the street and walk to the metro.","9"
"Very enjoyable stay with Patrick! Super relaxed, and easy going. Friendly and helpful.  Beautiful room with a wonderful view of the sunset. Thank you for such a memorable first stay in Montreal! ","9"
"I had a comfortable stay at Patrick's house . He gave me good advice where to look around . His place is spacious , tidy and the location is great for those who are foodie since the famous market Jean- Talon is walking distance from the house I cant help going back for more oysters and cheeses . If you feel like cooking on your own you can get the freshest produce in Jean-Talon . And it is 3 minutes walking to subway takes just 20 minutes to get to downtown . Patrick's dog Jarva is super cute and friendly very easy to get along with him .","9"
"Très bon séjour dans l'adorable appartement de Pat. Chambre spacieuse et lumineuse, salon et cuisine confortables et bien équipés le tout à moins de 10 min du métro et des bus. Vraiment un place de choix pour un séjour à Montréal! Pat est accueillant et super arrangeant, on se sent comme à la maison! Je conseille.","9"
"Logement un peu excentré mais proche du métro pour se rendre dans le centre. Quelques bonnes adresses à proximité (cinéma, restaurants, supermarchés). L'appartement est grand. Le lit, un peu petit pour 2 personnes. Bref, bien pour quelques jours si vous souhaitez découvrir la ville. Et n'hésitez pas à demander à Patrick, il saura vous conseiller.","9"
"Pat's place was great. I was a long term guest and I found it very comfortable and convenient. The animals were both sweet and it was a very nice place to stay. The metro was very convenient and parking was easy to find. I'd highly recommend staying here!","9"
"Patrick was a welcoming and accommodating host. His place has a very relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. Everything was as I expected; all facilities very adequate and efficient.  The bed was super comfortable, I slept well.  I agree its the best spot in town!!!","9"
"Patrick was great, room was great, location was great. His dog was friendly and never barked when we snuck in late. We would have hung out with him more but our schedules didn't line up. All of his suggestions were on point, if we return to Montreal we will definitely try to stay with him again","9"
"I had booked another room but since there was a problem with that listing, I went to Patrick’s place. So it was a very last minute booking but he kindly accommodated me. He was very fast in answering the messages. Patrick and his girlfriend recommended me very interesting restaurants, so ask them for that! ;)
The room was very clean with a comfortable bed. Also Patrick provided me some towels. The dog, was very friendly, quiet and respectful. The place was close to metro (5mins) so you can reach the down town in 25 mins. ","9"

"Venant pour la première fois à Montréal , j'ai été agréablement surpris par l'accueil chaleureux et la gentillesse de Patrick et de sa compagne Édith . Ils sont aussi très attentifs à ce que leurs hôtes se sentent à l'aise et ils n'hésitent pas à donner de précieux conseils pour visiter Montréal .
Leur appartement , décoré avec beaucoup de gout , est très spacieux , propre et très bien tenu . Le quartier est calme et sympathique , avec le métro et toutes sortes de commerces tout proche. Bref , une autre bonne raison pour moi de revenir à Montréal , est d'aller redonner un petit bonjour à Patrick et Édith .","9"
"We had a terrific stay at Patrick's place. The neighbourhood was quiet and very lovely. The subway is just a five minute walk, making the Jean Talon Market among many other sites and attractions easily accessible. The apartment itself was just as advertised, but with even more charm and was very clean. Patrick himself is very kind, and responsive. I highly recommend staying with Pat and his cute dog (who is totally gentle and calm).  ","9"
"Merci encore Patrick et Edith pour cet accueil chaleureux ! Au plaisir de vous recroiser à Montréal !","9"
"J'ai choisi cet appart car il a l'air vraiment chic et ça m'a absolument pas déçu. Toutes les pièces sont bien meublées (un divan et plusieurs chaises très confortables). La cuisine est tout équipée. Les animaux du appart étaient trop adorable et extrêmement calme. Juste une marche de 5 minutes du Métro. Patrick et sa copine étaient très arrangeants et réspecteux. Je me suis senti comme chez moi. Vraiment un excellent choix pour un séjour à Montréal.","9"
"We throughly enjoyed our stay with Patrick and his lovely girlfriend. Their apartment was beautiful and conveniently located to public transportation. There is also a street just two blocks south with plenty of delicious restaurants and a lush park as well; the neighborhood is perfect and gave us a real sense of authentic Montreal while avoiding the overrun tourist areas. Their dog Java was a sweet heart and always the first to welcome us in. The hosts were a great resource and gave us many recommendations of things to do and places to visit during our stay. Overall we had a terrific stay in Montreal and would love to return soon!","9"
"This place is not only exactly as pictured, it is also super close to the metro. The Jean-Talon market is close, walkable, and there are a couple of great parks close by. I would recommend BOTH he space and the host.","9"

"The place is 5 min walk to the metro and close bus stop. Pat and his girlfriend Edith have been friendly host. Edith recommended places to eat around as I was new to Montreal. Great stay","9"
"What a lovely and kind couple. I felt comfortable and at ease with them and they were both so good at recommending local spots and good places to go in town. I really appreciated that. The flat is lovely and light and only about 5 mins walk from a metro station, as well as a park and the many cafes and shops on Beaubien. Highly recommend.","9"
"A very polite and friendly couple, close to the subway station with market on the side. Very cozy and beautiful house besides very clean.","9"
"Patrick’s place was perfect and its great location made it super convenient to get around! The apartment is just as amazing as it looks in the photos and everything is kept in great condition. Being five minutes away from the Iberville metro station made it super easy for us to get from place to place and really make the most out of our stay! Would 100% recommend staying here to anybody and would gladly come back the next time I’m in the city.","9"
"This is by far my best Airbnb experience! 
Patrick and Edith are not just a lovely couple but wonderful human beings.  They were very amicable and were always available for any help or guidance.  About the place, it is designed and decorated with artsy touch, minimal yet deep, and very clean too. It has a pretty tranquil vibe to it and their dog and cat would be very nice company. For me, the balcony was the cherry on the top.  Metro is 5mins walk away and grocery store is steps away - which is awesome.  And yeah, they have some pretty amazing recommendations so don't forget to ask them. :)

Will definitely visit again, highly recommended!","9"

She was also very helpful, understanding and accommodating.  I would definitely recommend her to anyone wanting to visit Montréal. I will definitely come again!!!","9"
"Did not love this place, though the pictures on the profile looked super nice! It was dirty and hardly anything in the kitchen. A few plates and glasses, a small pot and pan - not for making any dinners at home. I even had to get my own coffee cup! Also to me, a very hard bed but others might like that. 
I will not visit here again. ","9"
"First time visiting Montreal and we couldn't have picked better place. The condo was walking distance to everything.  Restaurants, shopping, transit it's near to everything.  Place was spotless when we arrived.  Sophia communicated everything in a timely manner.  We can't wait to come back here to stay at her place again. ","9"
"It was downtown.  Everything was close by.  The spot was clean. Loved it.","9"

It's in walking distance of everything, so there is no shortage of options after you check in. She was also a great host who checked in with us to make sure everything was alright and if we were enjoying ourselves, and was open to communicate with whenever, and gave quick, helpful responses, when contacted. I highly recommend this place to all wanting to stay in Montreal, and it's for a reasonable price which is always great!","9"

"Will list a few key things to help other travelers out:

- Loft is wonderful and perfect for a couple and / or family of 3-4. Bed is a double which makes it a tight fit with two grown adults but it does the job.
- The location is definitely A+ and you will be extremely happy. It is walking distance to a plethora of restaurants, shopping as well as misc. stores (Shoppers Drugmart, Convinience, etc).
- Bixi bikes are within 20 ft of the entrance / exit making it that much more enjoyable to ride a bike throughout Montreal
- Uber to and from this space is extremely accessible and I didn't spend more than $20 to get from the bnb to the casino, schwartz deli, old montreal, etc.
- Host provided us with towels, cleaning supplies, soap, etc. for our stay although we did use our own
- Pictures in the listing are 100% accurate and you won't see any surprises
- Wifi is also available at this location as well for those who rack up data usage.

Overall, I give this space a 5/5. This was my first airbnb stay as well as first time in Montreal and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Will be booking this space in the future if I do come back to Montreal soon.

THANK YOU!","9"

Unal has created a very welcoming living space for guests and the fast internet connection and Netflix were a big bonus. The location was also great for exploring the city both on foot and by public transport. Communication with Unal was very clear and easy. He's a very friendly and welcoming guy so we felt at home right away, and if we had questions or needed anything he responded very quickly. We would definitely stay again and can recommend Unal's place to anyone visiting Montreal.","10"
"L'appartement d'Elise et Bernard est très bien placé, dans une rue calme et agréable. Il y a le marché Jean Talon pas très loin ainsi qu'une station de métro à quelques minutes. 
L'appartement est clair, propre et très bien équipé. La literie est fabuleuse. 
Elise et Bernard nous ont très bien accueilli et ils ont toujours été très disponibles. Je recommande ce logement sans hésitation.   ","10"

"Très bon emplacement ds quartier très agréable. Appt spacieux et parfaitement équipé. Très bon accueil chaleureux. Stationnement privé, un plus à Mtrl.
Une adresse à recommander.","10"
"The value of this booking was incredible. A lovely LARGE one-bedroom (by NYC standards!) walking distance from Metro and bike-share. Bernard the neighbor was extremely thoughtful and helpful as Elise was out of town and we couldn’t have asked for more!","10"
"I was their first guest and I had a great time. Collin and Sandy are very welcoming and happy to help you to get around the city.
The room is more than what you need. The bed is big enough for two persons and you have space in the room to put all your luggage. Even although they say the room is in progress I think it is more than what you need for a few days.
The apartment is very clean and they allow you to use the kitchen to cook.
They both speak English and French,Collin is German and Sandy is really good in Spanish so the language should not be a problem.
The location is great, so overall it is a great place to spend a few days getting around Montreal","9"

"My daughter and I had two great nights with Collin and Sandy. Their apartment is immaculate, bright and a perfectly located. So close to the subway and plenty of shops and parks right in the neighbourhood. The best part, though, was morning deliciousness at Kouing Amman.  Sandy and Collin were very good hosts. Welcome to Canada!","9"
"Me and my brother went to Montreal for three nights and stayed with Sandy and Collin and we enyojed out stay a lot! Their apartment is perfectly located, clean, beautiful, bright and cozy.

"Collin and Sandy are the perfect hosts! I can't stress enough how perfect the location really is. The place is clean, tidy, and comfortable. Above all — it's refreshing meeting smart, like-minded folks :) would love to stay at Collin & Sandy's next time I visit Montreal.","9"

"I had a great first experience of montreal thanks to Collin and Sandy. I booked the room last minute and they were very understanding. Their apartment is really cute, big, cosy and the room is super comfortable. They live in a great lively neighborhood, close to a convenient train station and tons of cool bars, restaurants, shops and cafés. They provide plenty of good advices and make you feel at home right away. If you're looking for an easy affordable and comfortable stay, look no more. This is the spot.","9"

The location could not be better-we were able to easily access everywhere we wanted to go. Most things were in walking distance. Colin and Sandy were great hosts as well, making us feel comfortable and welcome in there home, and giving us great advice on places to go to in the city. Thanks Colin and Sandy!  ","9"

"Really enjoyable weekend in Montreal. The apartment is in a fantastic location- on the doorstep of several good restaurants/ Mont Royal. Colin & Sandy were very friendly and gave some great restaurant/ brunch suggestions. Would definitely recommend to others.","9"
"L'appartement est confortable, de même que la chambre. Hôte agréable et disponible.","9"
"Nous avons séjourné chez Colin et Sandy fin avril et nous avons passé un super moment.
Nous n'avons eu l'occasion de rencontrer que Colin car Sandy était en voyage.
Colin est une personne ouverte, accueillante, gentille (et bricoleur ;) ) et avec qui il est très sympathique de discuter et passer du temps.
L'appartement est très bien situé, joliment décoré, et la chambre très agréable. 
Métro, parc Montroyal, petits restaurants, magasins et super boulangerie !! à proximité. 
Nous recommandons vivement un séjour chez eux et nous reviendrons sans hésiter.","9"
"We had a great stay in Montreal and at Colin & Sandy's place. The flat is well located, close to Subway and Bixi stations, and also to market places. 
We were also good welcome by Colin, and we felt like home for the 5 days we spent at his place. 
","9"
"Nous avons séjourné trois nuits chez Colin et Sandy, ce sont des hôtes très sympathiques, ils nous ont donné de nombreux conseils pour la visite de Montréal.
Notre séjour à été parfait, nous les remercions encore pour leur accueil.  ","9"
"The apartment is very conveniently located, just steps from the metro station and right in the center of the Plateau district. The place is very cute and clean. Sandy & Colin are very helpful and friendly but also great about respecting their guests' personal space. ","9"
"Colin and Sandy's place was clean and had everything we needed. The location was incredibly convenient. There are a lot of great places to eat within steps of the apartment and they are about a 15 minute walk of two great parks. The metro station was really close, as well. 
","9"
"The place was just as described. Great location. Very good communication. Helpful restaurant recommendations. We enjoyed our stay very much.","9"
"Even though Colin & Sandy had different schedules than mine, they were super nice! The bedroom is really good and the neighborhood is the best. I couldn't think of a better place to stay, couple of blocks from the Mont-Royal Metro station, a block away from Bixi stations, really good restaurants and amazing croissants at Au Kouign-Amann.","9"
"Sandy and Collin's flat is located in central Montréal, few hundred meters away from station Mont Royal. The block is nice, a park is not far away as well as supermarket.
Flat description matches with pictures on airbnb, it is just bright, clean and cool.
Great places to get a beer or to eat will be adviced by Collin who has maybe thousands of good addresses for food (thanks again for Trip de Bouffe !).
We travelled with our little 14 months boy who faced jetlag and woke up every day at 5 AM. Nevertheless, Sandy and Collin remained very patient and we are very grateful for that.
To sum up: a good place to stay to visit Montréal.","9"
"A perfect spot to launch our Montreal exploration!  We parked the car at the neighboring pay lot, and didn't drive during our entire stay.  Colin is a very nice, quiet & accommodating host.  The room was lovely, a little warm on a couple of the hot nights, but otherwise very comfortable.  The neighborhood is very active, but the apartment is nicely located down a quiet side street.  

Note the apartment is on the second floor, which might be an issue for those with disabilities.

We look forward to returning!","9"
"Colin a été un super hôte: il nous attendait à notre arrivée, nous a fait visiter l'appartement et nous avait préparé des guides pour notre séjour à Montréal. L'appartement de Colin est situé dans un quartier au top, le plateau. A quelques minutes à pieds du Mont Réal et de la station de métro Mont Réal. Quartier branché et dynamique: restaurants, bars, boutiques...","9"
"This place is in an absolutely great location, and is a bright, airy room.  Colin was great, although we kept different schedules and rarely saw each other.  The room was clean and simple. ","9"
"Colin was very accommodating  and responsive to our day-of request (we were on a long road trip, had a last minute change of plans, and ended up in Montreal).  After driving 13 hours we got in way late and arrived finding the room exactly as pictured, and everything fresh, tidy and clean. We awoke to find ourselves in the heart of Montreal, a half block to Mont Royal and a short walk to this lovely park.  We just stayed the day and another night, and didn't even really get a chance to meet Colin, but it was a perfect place for our short  stay.  The brochures and maps of Montreal in our bedroom was a nice touch!","9"
"The Collin Experience…. That’s how I describe my trip to Montreal. Collin made my friend and I feel like we were visiting a friend rather than staying with a stranger. He was very warm, welcoming and accommodating. The listing was more than described the view from the terrace made for a perfect place to just relax with a couple of the local IPAs from the area. The backyard has a quant little seating area where you can enjoy a private conversation in the morning with a cup of Espresso. Collin directed us in all the right directions for AMAZING food and places off the touristy path. Best trip to Montreal I’ve had and I think it will be returning once a year around the time same :) Thanks Collin for making me and my friend feel right at home in a new place. ","9"
"It was my first experience with airbnb and it was a great one.
Sandy (who I met briefly) and Collin were very welcoming, and I felt like at some friend's place. Their appartment is no more no less as displayed on the pictures. 
While the flat is very close to a lively  avenue, I can confirm what i had read in a previous comment (I think ?) : it's very livable. You don't hear much noise. so the location is great too, in addition of being convenient for public transportation.
You can really have confidence in Collin's advices for places to eat : He knows ! 
The French bakery he would recommend you has delicious croissants (and the compliment comes from a Frenchman). Also I had my best dinner in Canada (meal and wines from Québec)  in a bistro he suggested to me, at the corner, 100m from  their place.
to conclude, I was very satisfied with my 4-day stay at their place. ","9"
"Colin's place is awesome and the neighborhood fantastic. He's a cool guy and we had fun staying at his place. I can definitely recommend him as a perfect host.","9"
"The location is AMAZING! Not only because there's the best boulangerie in town but also because you are right in the heart of the Plateau, in the middle between the Mile End and Center/Vieux Montreal Neighborhoods. Colin was so nice, wanting to connect with us and get our feedback about the city and giving us some good tips. We felt like we were staying at a friend's house. He really makes you feel comfortable to you stay at his home.","9"
"I stayed at Collin's place for over two weeks during Quebec's glorious fall season, while on a sabbatical visit at Concordia University, and much enjoyed it - it's spacious and functional and in a very vibrant area full of quirky eateries, cafes and shops, and within walking distance of Mont Royal where i did some wonderful hikes amidst the turning foliage. Considering the night life in the neighbourhood, it's not a completely tranquil place - the bedroom faces a small residential street near the corner of one of the main drags (Avenue Mont-Royal) but you can still get a good night's rest if you're not hypersensitive to occasional outdoor acoustics. Both Collin and i had busy schedules, so we didn't coincide on a daily basis, but one night we shared a fantastic meal whose ingredients had been grown organically on urban rooftops in Montreal. Highly delicious + recommended!","9"
"Our host was very helpful and he answered my queries promptly.   We only met once and he was very friendly and made us feel welcome.
The room we had was as described and very clean as was the bathroom.
The apartment was a bit smaller than we had hoped but we made do as we weren't there very much ourselves.
The location is the most attractive feature being only 1 block from several main streets with loads of restaurants, bars and entertainment.

","9"
"Colin est un hôte fort sympathique, ses conseils nous ont été utiles pour visiter MONTRÉAL en 3 jours et pour apprécier les bonnes tables.  La rue est calme, néanmoins proche d’un quartier animé, restaurants, bars, boutiques (dont la meilleure pâtisserie du pays) et  proche de la station de métro Mont Royal. 
On se sent comme à la maison, l’équipement est complet, le café pour le petit déjeuner est prévu . Chambre agréable, le parquet craque, c’est un peu gênant pour les déplacements nocturnes dans l’appartement mais il parait que c’est de coutume à Montréal.  
Notre séjour à été parfait, nous le remercions encore pour son accueil.

"Nous avons eu un problème lors de la réservation et Collin a été très compréhensif et nous a donné des solutions qui nous ont satisfaites. L'appartement est très bien localisé, à quelque pas de Av mont-royal! Stationnement pour 10$ la nuit à 2 min de l'appartement. Nous avons adoré notre séjours à MTL. Merci pour tout.

"My stay with Collin was very pleasant - he was home to greet me upon my arrival to the flat (which is beautiful) and was very accommodating when a third joined our party on short notice. The room was clean, comfortable, and warm - I would definitely stay here again in the future!","9"
"si vous voulez être hébergé par un célibataire décontracté, qui réussit à être disponible sans être trop présent, alors allez chez Colin !

confort assuré, malgré les -40°C de février
tres bon séjour en ce qui nous concerne","9"

"Colin was an amazing, friendly host! He really did the best to make me feel welcome in Montreal, and truly embodies what AirBnB is about—meeting cool, friendly people from all around the world. :) Be sure to check out the recommendations for food and drink in his guidebook as well, all of which were delicious and very reasonably priced.

The room was just as pictured, and very bright and nice during the day. The location is also wonderful. The apartment is right in the centre of Le Plateau, and only a couple of minutes away from the nearest subway station.","9"
"Colin was a great host and we really felt welcomed to stay at his place. The appartment and the neighbourhood are lovely. There are plenty of small cafes and reasonable priced restaurants near Colin's place. We stayed only couple of days during a weekend but a good location made it easy to see all the places we had planned to see.","9"
"Colin est un hôte très attentioné. Il a pris soin de s'assurer que mon séjour se passait bien. il prend également plaisir à échanger avec ses visteurs autour d'un repas. La literie était propre et les lieux communs également. La localisation est parfaite, à 3 min à pied du métro Mont-Royal.","9"
"The apartment was clean and Collin provided towels, guide books/maps and our own shelf in the refrigerator.  We hardly used the fridge space cause we were out and about the whole trip.  For that same reason, we didn't talk to Collin much although he seemed like a great guy and gentleman. Reach for the stars!  Thanks Collin our experience was excellent!","9"
"Collin et sa copine ont été très accueillant et agréable. L'appartement est très sympathique avec une décoration agréable et des aménagements prévus pour les visiteurs très pratiques. Idéalement placé, juste à côté d'une grande avenue avec beaucoup de commerces et à 3 min à pied du métro. Nous ne sommes pas resté longtemps à Montréal mais nous avons grandement apprécié notre séjour.","9"

"Colin was a wonderful host, he really know what he's doing! Everything is his house is guest-proof! We didn't see each other much he made sure we had everything we needed.
The area is really great, very alive in the evening but not noisy at all. 
Great place to go to!","9"
"The apartment is very well located. It is right at the center of the vibrant Plateau Mont-Royal. It is well kept and clean. Although we did not see much Colin during our two nights stay, he was always responsive to our questions and our arrival went very well. ","9"
"The location is just perfect. Take a couple steps out of Colin's apt and you will find yourself in the best, happening, fun neighborhood of Montreal. Endless brunch spots, bars, used book stores, people watching. But... that's not everything. You've got to chat with this guy! He's awesome, easy going, and he will make you feel at home. I wish I was staying longer so we could hang out more. I will definitely visit again!!","9"
"We had an amazing time staying at Collin's apartment. The location can't be beat, it's a clean spacious place and he was very hospitable. His guide for the neighborhood was amazing too, it made our couple of days so easy, everything he suggested was fantastic.","9"

"We visited Montreal for Jazz festival and stayed in Collin's apartment for three  nights. Collin's apartment in perfect location! We walked almost everywhere. There is a Bixi bike station very close to his apartment and you can find these stations in every two blocks. We felt very comfortable in his apartment, and spent great time in the neighborhood!

"Collin is a great host! Staying with him is a lot of fun, he can show you a lot of interesting places, he takes care of you and is always trying to make you feel as comfortable as possible.

"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt in Collin's Wohnung (die wirklich perfekt im Ausgeh- und Szeneviertel liegt) und er hat uns viele gute Tipps zum Einkaufen und zu Restaurants in Montreal gegeben. Vielen Dank!","9"
"The place was great, and it was close to some really sweet bars and restaurants. Colin was really helpful providing us with excellent places to eat and go out. We didn't have much of a plan coming to Montreal and he was quick to fill us with ideas! His place is cozy so it can feel a little cramped with more than 3 people. The only area to hangout is the kitchen or the bedroom but if you plan on just using the  apartment as a place to crash then its great! Overall Colin made the experience very nice and I  recommend others booking their stay here as long as they are cat friendly!","9"
"Thanks to Collin's advices the trip to Montreal was amazing.

His appartement is right next to some bars and restaurants, so you can go everywhere by foot.

I would definitely go there again!

Thank you again for hosting!","9"

"I've had a great time at Colin's apartment. The place is close to so many restaurants, bars and 24/h quick markets, so you basically can do everything by foot, also, there's a subway station a few blocks away from it, so it's easy to get there and move around town. The bedroom is exactly the way pictured. Also, Colin's girlfriend was very friendly and welcoming and she gave me precious tips on where to go eat and have some fun around Montreal! I recommend staying there! :)","9"
"Colin and Melissandre were very kind guests. The arrival process was extremely easy, even though I got there when they weren't home. They were both super welcoming and able to chat restaurant recommendations as well as tour guide tips. They are fun if you like video games, Netflix or comic books and I feel anyone would feel at home in their place.","9"
"My friends and I visited Montreal for a weekend and stayed at Colin's apartment. We arrived slightly early and he was very accommodating and kind to us. Though there may be a larger age gap between us, Colin is young at heart and knows how to have a good time. He made some nice recommendations for bars that my friends and I visited. 
He also has a cat and we would have played with her all day! If you're privileged to have the room pictured on the listing, you will have the pleasure of being able to play with her every time you open your door :). The apartment was as beautiful as expected, and I couldn't have enjoyed it any more. ","9"
"Fue una muy buena y agradable experiencia. El departamento es totalmente igual al de las fotos, muy acogedor y cómodo. Colín y Melissandre excelentes anfitriones, nos dieron excelentes consejos de buenos lugares para comer, nos guiaron sobre la red del Metro y sobre todo de los mejores lugares para la compra de ropa de invierno! El departamento está Muy bien ubicado, el barrio tranquilo y seguro, el Metro se encuentra a unas cuantas cuadras del departamento así como el autobús, su ubicación es muy accesible. Muy recomendable la guía que hizo Colín para conocer los mejores lugares! ","9"
"I really appreciate Mel and Colin's openness with me. The food and kitchen were lovely and delicious. Their apartment's location was awesome, surrounding by the best bakery, cheese cakes and other cuisine. They are truly open minded and brilliant people who know how to enjoy life. Definitely recommended! You will gain more than just one tour. I thought I dislike Montreal but then I'm loving it. :D","9"

The room is also very nice : super lighty, lovely decorated, calm.
Bref, I feel very good at  their place :-)

Totally recommended :-)","9"
"Awesome location. Hosts were ready and willing to help with any advice. As is typical in Canada, there's no a/c but hosts were ready with fan. I would stay here again.","9"
"Si vous êtes accueillis par Colin, chance vous sera offerte de rencontrer un couple très sympathique et ouvert à l'échange. La chambre est telle que le suggère la photographie proposée, agréable et confortable. L'emplacement est idoine pour vivre le dynamisme d'une ville de Montréal où il fait bon vivre. Situés à quelques minutes à pieds de la station ""Mont-Royal"", elle-même positionnée à une station de ""Berri-UQAM"", centre synergique de la ville, vous serez à même de rapidement vous déplacer. En finalité, le logement comme la ville, devrait vous ravir.","9"
"Collin and Mel were such friendly And attentive hosts!!
Before my arrival he texted me to explain how to get the keys but when I arrived Mel was there and gave me some nice tips about the area.
Despite the short time In Montreal, I had a great time In their room! It was clean as well as the washroom and It has the best location!! I highly recommend their room!!
Thank you guys for receiving me!!
I hope to see you soon!!
Best wishes,

"I had an excellent stay in this flat: a cosy room, clean, fast WIFI and everything else that you need when travelling. Last but not least: the neighbourhood offers cool coffeshops, restaurants, metro and a beautiful area for running  (Montroyal is close).","9"
"Colin's place was fantastic, he and Mel were great hosts, super polite and fun to talk to, had great tips on where to go and how to navigate. Place was accesible and clean, the apartment is in a great location, lots of cool places on a walkable distance, and only 15 minutes by tube to Montreal's downtown. 100% would recommend.","9"
"Très bon séjour chez Colin et Mélissandre ! Très bel appartement et très propre ! Proche de toutes commodités à Montréal, très bon emplacement. 
Merci pour tout !!","9"
"This place was amazing. Hosts were friends and full of advice and information.

The guidebook Colin provided was absolutely perfect, it helped us decide on all our meals.

The location as prime, walking distance to the metro and right in the heart of downtown. A person really doesn't need a car.","9"
"As a ""virgin"" Airbnb-er this trip and experience has made me a believer in the whole process! Colin and Mel were beyond amazing and accommodating. I felt like I was staying with friends rather than strangers. They are both beyond friendly and helpful in making your way around the city :) The flat is in a beautiful area of the city, surrounded by cafes and boutiques. All the rest of the hustle and bustle is within walking distance or biking distance, as I opted for. There is a bixi bike stand just around the corner from Colin's place and this made it super convenient to come and go. The room and bathroom were clean!! This was a huge test for me...and I was grateful for the cleanliness factor. The apartment was hot while I was there (outside temp of +37 with the humidity) but there is a fan in the room which allowed me to sleep well at night.  I suggest ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, I go everywhere with mine, but I know I would have struggled with the outdoor traffic and creeky floors if I didn't have them :)

I couldn't have asked for a better experience, thanks you guys! ","9"
"It was a great experience to stay with Colin and Mel.
Everything went smoothly and everything was very relaxed.
Colin and Mel were always very friendly and helpful, though unfortunately I did not have the chance to get to know them properly, since I was always busy myself and spend most of the time outside the apartment.
Furthermore, I have to point out that the location of the apartment is very nice. The next Metro station is less than 5 minutes walking distance and you can reach virtually any place in the city within less than 30 minutes.
I would recommend this place to anyone, who wants to stay in Montreal.","9"
"Colin and Mel were excellent hosts and the this place was a really great value! The location is perfect and close to many shops and eateries as well as centrally located for many Montreal attractions. The flat is exactly how it is described in the post and their cat, Chipie is adorable and very friendly. When we arrived, Colin drew us a map of some great local spots to check out in the area and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely recommend staying here.","9"
"The stay at Colon's apartment was wonderful. He was always very quick to answer my questions and provided all the info that we need for our arrival. We stayed there for 3 nights and felt very comfortable there. The place itself is beautiful, lots of light and very nicely decorated. The bed was very comfy and the room more than big enough for two. The bathroom was very big and with a window. The apartment's location is great. Just off Mont Royal with lots of places to eat and shop and the metro is just a few blocks down. 
Colin and his girlfriend were extremely welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. They provided us with an extra duvet on very short notice and even though we didn't see them a lot due to their busy schedule they were always open to a little chat and asked how our day way and if there was anything we needed.
This place is really awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone who visits Montreal.","9"
"В целом, всё хорошо. Очень доброжелательные ребята, всегда готовы что-то подсказать, помочь. Дали прекрасные рекомендации мест, где можно поесть.","9"

"I was so lucky that as a foreinger moving to Montreal I came to Collin andMel´s home. Not only is a beautiful place, located in one of the most beautiful neightbouthoods in Montreal, but really, both of them were like angels to me. They helped me with everithing I needed and even introduced their friends too me. You can trust them 100 %, i defitily recomend this airbnb place. Thanks Mel and Collin.","9"
"Colin was a great host! He was easy to reach and gave us useful parking tips and dining suggestions. The apartment is very clean, quiet, and perfect for couples.  The location is great as well - we were steps away from bars and restaurants. Highly recommend!","9"
"Amazing location, friendly hosts, cute kitty :)","9"
"Colin and Mel were very nice. They were great at offering suggestions for things to do and places to eat/drink, and really friendly people! The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a great neighborhood that Colin accurately described as the ""Brooklyn of Montreal."" Lots of great food and drinks and close to the Metro for a quick trip to other neighborhoods. I would definitely stay here again! ","9"
"Colin, Mel and their sweet cat Chipie (probably didn't spell that right) were great hosts, very friendly and hospitable. The flat is exactly as described ""The Heart of Le Plateau"". It is within steps of cafes and restaurants and a few blocks from the Metro, making it extremely easy to get around Montreal. The neighborhood is awesome and I felt safe at all times. I would definitely recommend staying with this awesome couple.

"My dad and I had a great stay at Colin and Mel's place. The appartment is bright and welcoming, and the room is more than big enough! The apartment itself is ideally located in a lively neighbourhood and only a couple blocks from the subway. Getting to and from the Grand Prix couldn't have been easier. Communication with Colin and Mel was great, though we only saw Colin briefly on our first night. They have also created a really helpful guide of the area on Airbnb, which you should definitely consult. Would recommend!","9"
"Colin's place was very walkable, cozy. Colin couldn't have been a nicer host, I would recommend his place to anyone looking for a nice weekend in Montreal.","9"
"Eine Wohnung an perfekter Lage! Sehr nahe bei der Metro und viele tolle Kaffees und Läden in der Nachbarschaft. Mel und Collin sind sehr nett. Möchte man etwas anschauen oder Essen gehen haben sie immer einen Tipp. Die Katze ist einfach nur zuckersüss :)","9"
"We stayed here for 4 nights and we really enjoyed it! Cozy, bright room. Great fan in the room. Very homey. 2 blocks from a metro stop that takes you directly to old Montreal. 15 minute walk to Mt. Royal and Le Plateau. PERFECT location. Tons of yummy restaurants and coffee within blocks. Very kind and friendly hosts, extremely gracious. And Chipie is the best cat ever! So fluffy and friendly and loved to be pet :)","9"
"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour à Montréal. L'appartement est très bien situé dans un quartier animé, parfait pour découvrir la ville!
La chambre est conforme aux photos, confortable. Collin a été très accueillant et nous a donné plein de bons plans pour découvrir la ville! Je conseille ce logement!!","9"

"Muy bello lugar, céntrico de metro, restaurantes y bares, el vecindario muy acogedor para caminar... coincide el lugar con las fotos, Colin y Mel buenas personas.","9"
"My stay at Collin and Mels apartment was more than great. They were always very nice to me and we’re always there to help or to just have a pleasant conversation. I felt very comfortable living there and it is perfectly located especially to get the real plateau vibe but also to move quickly to other places in the city. 
I will definitely come back and I can only recommend this place to others.","9"
"Very nice place. Highly recommend who will come to Montreal!","9"
"Collin and Mel's place is located close to a lot of great food spots and cute stores in the Mont Royal neighborhood. They were very quick to respond to my questions and they're very friendly! Their space is a short walk from the Mont Royal metro station, making it easy to get places in Montreal. Thank you very much for a wonderful stay (wish it was longer)!","9"
"This was our first time using airbnb - and Collin and Mel ensured that it will be the first of many! Collin was very prompt with messages even before we booked. When we got in, both him and lovely Mel was there to check us in. They are such warm and wonderful people - they helped us with our bags (even though they didn't have to!), gave us so many incredible local tips (Collin is a chef, both he and Mel love cooking, so these guys know the real deal when it comes to food) and let us use their kitchen to make chai and generously told us we could use their Nespresso coffees and teas. The photos of the room and space on airbnb are accurate - it's nice and cozy, faces a relatively quiet street so you have peace at night, but best of all, it's in a fantastic neighborhood. We loved that it's close to the metro, steps away from one of the best bakeries and excellent restaurants...just a fabulous way to soak Montreal in.

This being our first time, my husband was super nervous about ""staying in someone's home."" But it really felt so much more personal than being in a hotel, especially with their gorgeous ""cloud-like"" cat Chippie! We walked away making friends, these are people we'd love to spend time with over drinks (and we did!). Couldn't have asked for more. Thank you Mel and Collin, you guys made our stay in Montreal super special.","9"
"Really great location close to lots of shops and restaurants, but the apartment is still quiet so you can get a good rest. Mel was a wonderful host who offered helpful tips for getting around. I recommend staying here if you're looking to experience the best of the hip side of Montreal!","9"
"The space is very close to everything, the neighbourhood is fantastic with an incredible bakery little minutes away. Metro is only 5 minutes away so definitely a great location. Collin and Mel were very nice. The only downside is probably just the fact that the walls are very thin. My friend end up feeling really sick from something she had so the walls were thin that the whole apartment could hear that she was unwell. But other than that, the space was incredible and the location was great. A really solid choice for discovering the real Montreal.","9"
"Ce logement est parfait pour visiter Montréal ! L'accueil a été adorable, l'appartement et la chambre sont propres et jolis en plus d'être très bien situé. J'ai adoré mon séjour, je m'y suis sentie comme à la maison ! ","9"

"J'ai passé un très bon séjour chez Collin et Mélissandre! Ce sont des hôtes très accueillants, toujours prêts à vous mettre à l'aise et à partager leur connaissance de Montréal, notamment via des recommandations qui sont très utiles quand on arrive à Montréal sans connaitre la ville! 
La chambre est très agréable et fidèle à la description. La localisation de l'appartement est vraiment idéale : à deux pas du boul. St Laurent et de la rue St Denis et du métro Mont Royal. Il y a pleins de petits commerces de proximité  à côté de l'appartement : supermarché, boulangerie, pharmacie... 
En définitive, je ne saurais que vous recommander de séjourner chez eux, vous serez très bien accueillis !!","9"
"Collin’s place is in an amazing location! The neighborhood is fantastic with plenty of amazing bars and restaurants. They are just a few blocks away from the Metro station which allowed us to get everywhere we wanted to go in the city easily.

Un petit bémol pour la cuisine sombre et sans fenêtre, surtout que j'aime passer du temps en cuisine.

"Great place with a spectacular view of Montreal! Definitely reccomend!","9"
"I can't review the property because this host cancelled my reservation just before my visit. She magically had another property available at twice the price. This was during the F1 race so basically I was stuck as the city was basically no vacancy given the 10 day notice. This is my first host failure with airbandb. I was also disappointed airbandb provided no resolution for this issue. So I am not sure what to others renting from this host. Possibly there was a real issue with the apartment that was identified 10 days before my visit but could not be fixed by my arrival or they realized they rented it to me at too cheap a price and canceled the reservation knowing I would be stuck.","9"
"Stay perfectly on 26th floor in Montreal!

The condo is directly in downtown perfectly located. The condo is brand new and equipt with everything you need for your stay. The check in was easy and perfectly organized. 5+Star-Rating!
Enjoy your stay. 
Thanks Noussa","9"

"Great place","9"
"This was my first Airbnb experience and Noussa was very helpful. Not only was checking in easy, she was willing to work with our schedule as we were driving in and had unexpected delays. When we checked in, she gave us a thorough walkthrough of everything from parking to checking out at the end of our stay. Additionally, she gave us suggestions on things to check out in Montreal. She was also very easy to contact, and was always willing to help out, as the case when we came back one day to find out someone had mistakenly taken our parking spot. She was very quick in finding a solution and we didn't have to worry about parking anywhere else since parking downtown can be expensive. 

Overall a very good experience.","9"
"Great location. Everything within walking distance. We parked the car all 4 days and walked or used the Metro. Communication was excellent with Noussa. We had 4 adults in the condo, a little tight with only one bathroom. Condo was great, gym was excellent and outdoor common space was nice.","9"
"SUPERBE APPARTEMENT!! L'hôte est vraiment gentille. L'appartement est luxueux et entièrement équipé. Je le recommande à tous. Le bâtiment est magnifique.","9"
"Had a fantastic time in Montreal! The location is perfect in the centre of everything. We just parked our car and walked everywhere. It was great to have access to the pool and relax after so much walking. Noussa was a great host, easy to communicate with and really accommodating! The place was really clean and that's saying a lot coming from me since I'm a clean freak. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal. ","9"
"Great location, close to shops, restaurants and metro.  Apartment was clean, spacious and being on the 26th floor had good views over the city.  2nd bed was a pull-down bed and curtained off rather than being in a separate room but worked OK for us.  Great amenities in the building although the spa was closed during our visit but we enjoyed the outdoor pool and would have used the BBQ had we stayed longer!","9"
"Great location with walking distances to travelers spots. Noussa is very helpful with the check in. The unit is nice and clean, with all the fancy facilities in the condo building. ","9"
"The apartment is very centrally located, and convenient. The host was very friendly and easy to communicate. However, the unit is smaller than the photos depicted and not exactly 2 BR as advertised. Also the master BR had only sheer curtains to block any day light after 6 am. ","9"
"Never felt so welcome before , this airbnb was amazing, i stayed 3 days it was very spacious and really awesome location had a great time! I ever lost one of the house keys in the elevator and panicked but Noussa saved me with a spare at the right time! Communication was great she would reply instantly and make sure i had everything i need ! She went above and beyond! Cleanliness 100% dust free it looks like it was never lived in before and also HUGE balcony and awesome view! Thanks Noussa! Looking forward to coming back soon","9"

"Sehr netter Kontakt- die Lage ist ausserordentlich- wir waren inmitten des Geschehens- die Jugendlichen genossen den Kraftraum und wir Chilene bei Steak und wunderbarer Aussicht. Wer kann schon sein Steak im 10 Stock mit einer Aussicht über die Stadt zubereiten.
Die Altstadt ist mit der Metro, Station unter dem Haus, sehr gut zu erreichen. Wir werden sicher wiederkommen.","9"
"The location of the condo was amazing! The condo itself was also beautiful. However, we were a bit disappointed when it said it came with three beds and only two were available on arrival. Thankfully, she kindly brought the other one but we spent some time looking for it! Also, there was unfortunately not enough toilet paper to last out three day stay! There was also some confusion with the parking, there is no free parking available which was disappointing. Despite all this, would still recommend a stay here.","9"
"Noussa nous a efficacement accueillis, s'est montrée arrangeante ( notamment pour l'horaire de notre départ, le parking...) et reste discrète .
Nous avons apprécié l'appartement , qui est neuf, même si une des 2 chambres n'est fermée que par un rideau, la Tour avec ses installations communes (nous avons profité de la piscine , des barbecues sur la terrasse, du gym...), de son emplacement près du centre-ville , des commerces, des restaurants, du musée des beaux-arts ...
Nous avons fait un excellent séjour et nous sommes beaucoup plus.

"We were visiting Montreal for a couple of days and decided to try air bnb for the first time. We lucked out with such a great apartment and host. The apartment is just as pictured and described, it's very clean and modern. The view is incredible. It is centrally located and easy to get to restaurants, shops, and the subway. The building is very luxurious, modern and has a lot of amenities. The parking lot is clean and well spaced, we left our car there and were able to explore the city by foot and public transit. Noussa met us to show us to our parking space, guided us in and then showed us around the apartment. She was very responsive and texted us all the info as well.

"This apartment is really convenient and nice. I was attending a conference at Concordia and I was able to walk. I also had my baby and mother-in-law, and we all had space and a good experience. The beds are very comfortable and our travel crib fit in the main bedroom. It was also convenient to have the parking (which I think Noussa is very clear in the ad that it's 25$ per day), because parking downtown overnight for five days is not easy. The building is very modern and new and there is a grocery store right next door.  Noussa is a great host!","9"

"Noussa’s place is clean and tidy. The location is great (close to downtown and metro). Although the apartment is small (like 1 BR), it’s very well designed to host three of us without a feeling of crowdedness. 

Noussa is very responsive and considerate. She welcomed us in person and replied to our questions in no time. She offered us another parking space because of the size of our car.","9"
"Great location and a modern apartment with stylish ammentaties","9"

"A great location. Very communicative host. The bathroom is small with limited space for toiletries and towels. Space is adequate for 2 bedroom users but cramped for 3. Cute, small pool with 4 poster sun beds. Felt uncomfortable given it’s not an official Airbnb site.","9"

"Wouldn’t suggest this space due to inaccurate description of listing .","9"
"Their descriptions and photos don't do them justice! What they don't say in the description is that this isn't just a place to stay, but by far an amazing overall experience! Thomas (Nicky's assistant) was available at all times and gave us a lot of recommendations for places to go. But, that's not all... They are the managers at Thursday's and suggested we should go there for dinner, drinks, and dancing. Little did we know that free shots were included (and really good ones, actually)! And Thomas is so energetic and nice that he made us feel super comfortable with our stay and definitely made an impression of how awesome Montreal and it's people are. The apartment was spotless and gorgeous, although we didn't spend much time in the apartment because we were too busy exploring Montreal because of the apartments fantastic location. It is about 15 minutes walking distance to all the restaurants, bars and shops, and the subway is about 5 minutes walking distance as well. When I go back to Montreal, I am definitely staying here again. I definitely recommend this place.","10"

"Nicky's place is a fantastic place to stay in Montréal. It is clean, spacious and makes you feel like you are in a home. 

The location is fantastic with resturants, bars and clubs minutes away but secluded from the downtown area. 

Nicky is a great host and had open communication throughout the weekend and provided info on the local entertainment in the neighbourhood.

I will recommend this place to my friends if they are going to Montréal.","10"
"Nicky is a cordial and accommodating host.  Everything was terrific.  The location is accessible to many different neighborhoods, all quite walkable.  No hassles, we would stay there again.","10"

"Beautiful apartment in central location near metro, grocery shopping, bars, and restaurants. Large comfortable King bed and double size futon in second room. large well-equipped kitchen. Thank you for a great stay!","10"
"This home has everything you need for your stay. We made breakfast every day, including coffee with fresh-ground beans. The beds were comfortable and the desk in the smaller bedroom was great for my computer and the work I needed to do after each day out. There is a bus-stop right outside the front door. A parking space is included. It is about a 15 minute walk to the Sheraton Centre (less to the Bell Centre) and less than 30 minutes to most of the sites in Montreal's downtown.

Nicky is a great host and responded quickly to any questions we had. I would happily stay there again.","10"

Wir haben sehr gut darin geschlafen. Alles ist gut zu Fuss erreichbar. Es hat einige Restaurants in naher Umgebung. Die Kommunikation mit Nicky war absolut problemlos. Ein sehr guter Gastgeber. Wir würden die Wohnung jederzeit weiterempfehlen.","10"
"Condo was really nice and showed like the pictures.   Nicky was an amazing host, especially on check-in (again, sorry for being late!) and very helpful on local bars and restaurants.   Location was a bit of a walk to the downtown and Port areas but it was summer and made for a nice walk around the city.   Overall, it was a great stay in Montreal and would come back if ever in town again.","10"
"Nicky is a great host, and the condo is so close to everything. We visited Montreal for a conference and the location is so convenient that we even managed to do some sight seeing in between.","10"
"Big place, close to everything.","10"
"What I loved: 
- Nicky and his friend Mike are trustworthy, helpful, and reliable
- The size was fantastic as well as the layout. 
- The kitchen amenities and cooking utensils available were more than expected. 
- The Metro (grocery store) was only 5 minutes away (by walking) and had so many great food items for cooking or ready-made meals, and the prices were reasonable. 
- The shower had great water-pressure. 
- The tap-water was safe to drink and use for anything 
- The neighbours were quiet and polite, and the neighborhood was safe with plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. 
- Netflix was a huge bonus! 

Good to know: 
- The bedrooms have all you need, but don't have clocks, so use your cellphone or whatever as an alarm clock 
- The air-conditioning unit is hooked up in the living room. So, if you want your bedroom cool, use the 2 fans that Nicky provides. 
- It's better to park your car and leave it at Nicky's to roam the city by foot or transit. The traffic is pretty heavy and it's hard to find parking in Montreal. You'll actually be faster and less stressed on foot or transit.","10"
"Great location. Easy parking. Check in was simple as well as check out. As a single female I felt totally safe. The bed was comfortable and it was nice having toiltries provided in the bathroom. I'd stay at Nicky's place again.","10"
"Nicky's condo is terrific. Having a dedicated parking space is a big deal even though we didn't move the car for the three days we stayed. The Montreal Metro is a short walk away that gets you to anywhere. There is a good supermarket and a gourmet grocery store within a five minute walk. After each busy day touring in Montreal with our grandson the apartment was a great place to settle in. We cooked a couple of nights and the kitchen is really well equipped.  Highly recommended.
Dennis and Kate","10"
"Ma mère et moi avons passé un mois merveilleux ! 
L'appartement est full équipé, confortable, propre et l'immeuble est très calme. 
Le quartier est très agréable, avec de nombreux restaurants et bars sur la rue notre dame. 
Le centre ville est tout près, à pied cela se fait parfaitement. 
Nicky est une personne très agréable. 
Nous nous sommes senti comme chez nous, et nous y retournerons sans hésiter !","10"
"This is a great place to stay while you’re in Montreal. The host, Nicky, was very responsive, very helpful and has set up beautiful apartment. 

Having a parking space is a huge plus. Being four blocks from Saint Catherine Street, and three blocks from Grey Nuns, which is where my son has his dorm while he is at Concordia was perfect. The kitchen is really quite handsome and everything was sparkling clean. 

The master bed was much more comfortable than I was expecting. We didn’t use the second room so I can’t say how that bed is but if it’s anything like the first one, you’ll be happy. The bathroom is spacious and refined. 

We will definitely be staying here the next time we come up to visit our son, so you better book early :-)","10"

"Nicky is probably one of the most responsive hosts I've ever had. The kitchen is by far the best equipped I've ever seen (and clean!). The location is perfect.

"Nicky's place was ideal for the back-end of our week-long stay in wonderful Montreal. It was the perfect location -- a nice stroll to Old Montreal, to the heart of the downtown area and to the Bell Centre where we took in a concert. The walk to the Bell Centre is no more than 10-minutes -- perfectly conveninent for our needs. Nicky's place is great. Communication and check-in was an excellent experience -- easy and fast. The apartment was spotless and the kitchen well-appointed with everything one requires to prepare meals. The air conditioning was a blessing, particularly the one in the bedroom, which made for comfortable sleeping. The patio was also a nice feature. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at Nicky's place and would certainly stay there again! Thanks, Nicky!","10"

"My friends and I (3 total) stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days. The location is really great - a block away from the metro and near some really great restaurants, pharmacies,  coffee shops, and shopping districts. We arrived 10-ish minutes early while the place was still being cleaned out, but we were able to meet YJ who is really very sweet. There was some confusion about parking and I would ask for clearer directions to the garage. YJ did have to return to show us the exact garage, but I am so grateful for her willingness to help her guests. The apartment itself was small, cozy, and clean. It's identical to what you see in the photos. Free Netflix, internet access, toiletries, all the amenities you'd really need on a short vacation. Overall, I'd love to stay at YJ's place if we are to visit Montreal again.","9"

"It is a simple, no frills accommodation in a good location. Free easy parking is a plus, very close to public transportation. Fast wifi. Bathroom needs renovation and a few hooks to hang towels on. Kitchen is well equipped, did not find the cutting board though. I would say it is a decent accommodation for those who travel on budget by car. Do not expect local, home-like experience: its rent-only apartment and we never met the host. However, all our requests were met and response was fast and informative. Thank you Yj and Sebastien!","9"

"The location is good and close to restaurants, shops  and stuff. There is a college near by so it's a lively area but we didn't have any issues trying to sleep at night or anything. The garage parking is a plus (in-out privileges)  if you drive or have a rental. Check-in and check-out was easy and pretty straight forward. Had a little trouble getting the master lock open but eventually got it. Sebastian was very responsive, nice and helpful with any issues or questions. Didn't have to wait long for him to respond at all. If anything, the bathroom could have been a little more cleaner but overall the place is just like it is described in the posting and pictures. I would recommend staying here.   ","9"
"We stayed at Sebastian/Yj's place for 3 nights and it was great.  He was very responsive and had some great suggestions for things to do in town.  We ate at Kampai ( shrimp tacos to die for) and spent most of our time in the Old Towne and at the Just For Laughs festival.

Location is great; Bixi bikes abound, and everything is in walking distance.  CRV DOES fit in the garage, but I wouldn't go any bigger than that! :)

The flat is nice and clean and well equipped.  Bathroom a little dated, but who cares when you are out and about!!  I would stay again if we head back that way.","9"
"Great location , a stroll away from the Bell Centre. Parking is a little tight but doable.","9"
"Clean. Parking and wifi is a plus. In a sort of financial district. 25 min walk to closest historical sites and 10 min uber ride.","9"
"It was really convenient being able to park our car in the garage. We are like that the apartment had a lot of light and who is simple. It was situated  Close enough to downtown that we could walk everywhere. Is it convenient Superette right downstairs to get milk and coffee etc. 

For our part we  didn't mind not having any contact with Sebastian during our stay. We came and went as we please. We didn't need to call him for anything. We found most of what we needed in the apartment with the exception of the bathmat, a cutting board.

 The only thing I wouldn't really make note is the state of the bathroom. While it was impeccably clean and painted white, it was very much Dated. The grouting was mouldy and the wall was peeling from humidity. There was no working vent in the bathroom. The sink drain stopped up systematically, several minutes to drain after brushing teeth.  The water pressure in the shower was OK, but again I Only used the hot water. I thought that it was warm, comfortable. 

The mattress was extremely firm. The pillows very high. That's all personal taste. The couch however I was very uncomfortable even The mattress was extremely firm. The pillows very high. That's all personal taste. The couch however I was very uncomfortable even for tonight to sit on. 

Still we're very happy we stayed there and would go back again because it was very clean and well located with a parking garage.

 Not Sebastian's mom died soon as you get off the elevator on the fifth floor you overcome by the smell of cigarettes. A neighbor no doubt.","9"
"Very clean place and host was very helpful. Had a great experience !","9"
"Great location! Right by the subway and near all the restaurants. The building is an older building and so it had a bit of a stench throughout the halls and into the room. Thankfully there was an air purifier/AC in the bedroom that cleared it up. The bathroom was decent but definitely rough around the edges. Was pleased that Sebastien had very clear and easy instructions on how to check in and check out. The wifi wasn't working during our trip but we weren't home enough to really be concerned. Underground parking is a great add to this place. Just be aware that the parking lot is a bit dirty. Overall, great place for a great price!","9"
"This was my first Airbnb experience and I can say it with confidence that this is the best place to stay at when visiting Montreal. The place was very clean, as shown in pictures. Rather it looks more beautiful and clean in reality than pictures. The check in was very easy, just had to follow the instructions. Since I drove to this place so the best part was the place had a parking too, which otherwise is very difficult to find in Montreal downtown area. The place is only a few steps away from Metro station and from Saint Catherine street (very lively in night, especially over the weekend). The Mont royal park is very near by too, so no need for driving to it. Fine arts museum is close by too.
Overall, I would say we had an ultimate experience and our stay was very smooth and relaxing.
We would definitely stay at this place only, whenever we plan to re-visit the city in future.
Also, our host Sebastian was very helpful in promptly replying to our queries and helping out with suggestions to see places in the city.","9"
"Great location close to restaurants. Clean and is exactly as presented. Instructions were clear and concise and host was attentive and responsive.","9"
"Great Location, walking distance to downtown core, quick uber service to address","9"
"This place is very convenient to stay at. The host provided very good, thorough instructions on how to check-in and out. In addition, it is located downtown. The garage was very useful, although it was small and an SUV bigger than a CR-V won't fit. Overall a pretty good stay, and the host was helpful.","9"
"Everything you will need! It is clean, wifi was fast, towels were provided, and parking spot was a plus! The bathroom could be updated, but I been in worst. Sebastian is quick to respond and very thorough with his instructions!","9"
"Lovely clean place. Great location. Check in was as easy as checking into a hotel, very professional.","9"
"Clean place, good price, and downtown. Would stay here again if I were visiting in Montreal.","9"
"Sebastian was a great host and we had a lovely time during our stay in Montreal. He was very clear with his check in and check out instructions prior to our trip. The apartment also came with Netflix, which was great during a rainy day. Overall, the place was clean, and the bedroom was especially neat. The bathroom could use some renovations and upkeep, as it was a bit old/well worn. The building itself is older and near a lot of universities, so it could get loud/rowdy at night. Thank you once again for hosting us! We hope to be back in Montreal again.","9"
"Beautiful apartment in an excellent location for exploring Montreal. Obviously recently renovated, very clean and modern. Only real downside is the bathroom which is quite dated in decor (plus the shower isn't the best). Considering value for money, however, the apartment was excellent and we would happily stay again.","9"
"We had a great stay in this apartment. It's in a good location close to the metro, supermarket, pharmacy and many restaurants and check in and out was easy. We ended up with a large car rental which was a squeeze to get into the garage but we managed with patience!","9"
"Sebastian and YJ's home is great! Central location and very convenient to have a designated parking space. Check in was very easy, the apartment is clean, and the bed is comfy. All our basic necessities were covered. Our first trip to Montreal and we are in love! ❤️","9"
"This place is the perfect spot for those looking to have a nice, comfortable place to call home while in Montreal. It’s right in the thick of the action while still being quiet for a restful night’s sleep. The hosts make the check in/out process seamless.","9"
"The host was very nice person , but you can't really see in the pictures that the bathroom is pretty old the the walls are feeling off. The window in the bedroom can't be closed until the end so you can hear noises or feel the cold. The bed was broken too. But the host was very helpful and brought us air mattress . Netflix was amazing ","9"
"Host was quick to respond, helpful, and patient. 

The place looks just like the photos and was exceptionally clean. Parking in the building is really convenient.

Bare bones on amenities and A/C only in the bedroom.

Not the best neighbourhood. ( loud party goers walking home at 3 am etc )

All in all a positive experience.","9"
"Overall, it was a great stay. When we first arrived we were greeted by a homeless man sleeping under the call box, which didn't make the best first impression. However, the apartment was nice and close to downtown and you can't beat the price given a parking spot is included. Sebastian was super helpful during check-in allowing us to check-in after 11pm. The apartment was clean and had all amenities you could need. At night the bedroom was a little noisy (neighbors, outside noises, etc.) but with its proximity to Downtown, some of that is to be expected.  Definitely worth the stay if you're visiting Montreal.","9"
"Great place ! :)","9"
"Clean appartment, renovated for the most part but the bathroom is in severe need of renovation. Be patient if you want to have hot water, it takes 10 minutes to get it.","9"
"The place was clean and perfect for two people. It is right beside many restaurants as well as public transportation. 

Would definetely recommend to anyone!","9"
"Very good place, centrally located.
One thing is certain: My next trip to Montreal will be spent at Sebastien's place.","9"

"Clean, convenient, nice and cozy place! Located in central downtown and very near to subway too. Great stay!","9"
"This apartment was very lovely and close to many places you'd want to visit in downtown Montreal and old Montreal. The building felt safe and the apartment was very spacious. Sebastien was very easy to communicate with and very responsive! The only thing I'd suggest an improvement on is updating the bathroom. I especially appreciated how clean the apartment was and the parking that was included!","9"
"Super easy check in and check out and Sebastian was prompt when I️ had an issue with the WiFi passcode.","9"

"Yj’s place is very close to great cocktail bars and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay.","9"
"Great location near the University. We were attending a conference near by, so this was perfect for us. Just a short walk from lively neighbourhoods & a quick uber or drive down to interesting restaurants and night life. It’s a super easy check in, and not having to worry about where to park over night was ideal.","9"

"We had a wonderful stay here ! Great location , walking distance to many many shops , restaurants and night life","9"
"This is a very convenient and great place in downtown Montreal near Concordia University. I had to help my daughter move out of her university residence, which was just a few blocks away. The underground parking and the elevator made is very easy to carry things to the apartment. The location is perfect. Pharmacie Jean Coutu, PA Supermarket, banks, restaurants, Dollarama and shops are one or two blocks away. The metro is just one block down the street. The apartment is very welcoming, cozy and has everything that you need. The TV has access to Netflix. I would definitely stay there again.","9"
"The apartment was nicer than i expected. it is close to tons of great restaurants and milk tea shops. you can walk to downtown shopping malls.  but the bathroom was kind of outdated. some plugs did not work, same as air circulation. garage looks sketchy but worked. Overall i would say it's a very good place to stay especially if you do not drive.","9"
"Amazing place to stay! Very close to restaurants and shops! I highly recommend.","9"
"Sunny, quiet, spacious, clean and nicely decorated, great location, good deal compared with a hotel. But the bathroom walls were in poor shape, the plumbing worked but needs maintenance and the sofa was pretty worn out and uncomfortable. Sorry.","9"
"Amazing, homey flat. Very European style, spacious living room and spacious closet space. The apartment was everything I hoped it would be. Highly recommend to stay at this flat. Location is perfect and full of city vibes. Thank you for the hospitality, very much appreciated !","9"
"Yj’s place is clean, roomy, and in a great location in downtown Montreal, near Concordia and McGill Universities, several museums, great restaurants and bars, etc. Check in/out process was easy to follow and very convenient, and responses from the host were in a matter of minutes! Would stay again!","9"
"Highly recommended! YJ’s apartment is very clean and nice, and has a great great location. It’s a really good experience!!","9"
"A great location a block from Guy-Concordia Metro station, two blocks from a bazillion restaurants on Rue Ste-Catherine, four blocks from Musee des Beaux Arts. This is an otherwise unoccupied apartment, so you won’t be climbing around someone else’s stuff. Nice comfortable bed. Two demerits: the living room couch we found to be uncomfortable, and the bathroom needs some serious cosmetic attention. ","9"
"A clean and well kept apartment.","9"
"Very good location. Communication is fast. Check-in process is smooth and clear.","9"
"Solid spot, well maintained, would recommend.","9"
"good place","9"
"Great location in downtown.  It's a block away from many great restaurants, shops, and bars.  However, I wasn't impressed that there was a $50 fee for ""cleaning"" added a few days before the trip (after the point where I could cancel in favor of other options). I expect the listed price to be the final price paid.","9"
"amazing","9"
"Good location, was really nice having an included parking space so we didn't have to worry about the car during our stay. The apartment is clean and neighborhood was safe, we really appreciated access to netflix on the tv and the AC in the bedroom! Thanks!","9"
"This is a great place, great location, clearly someone has put some good thought into it.  It also feels good to be in a place amidst real locals. Great place to lay your head for a night or two in Montreal!","9"
"The place is very clean and spacious. Only the bathroom needed renovation (to match the rest of the apartment) but everything worked well, no problems. Everything essential was provided. It's a nice comfortable space. I only had problems with Parking at the very beginning(check-in). A key fob is needed to enter the parking garage. So you need to find temporary street parking to go upstairs to get the key, so that you can go back downstairs to enter the parking garage. When leaving (checking-out), you also need to use the same key to exit the parking garage. Once you're out, you need to find temporary street parking once again so that you can enter the apartment and place all the keys where you first got them.","9"
"Good location, super close to train and bike share stations, lots of Asian restaurant options around the corner, parking super helpful. Directions for check in were detailed and had no problems. Wifi was fast and had no problems. Consistent with other reviews, the bathroom needs a lot of care and repair, futon in the living room is uncomfortable. We came during the major heat wave so AC Unit in the bedroom (only) was helpful but only so much you can do with 100F heat. Lighter and cotton bedding would be helpful in summer time, otherwise bed is comfortable.  Has the basics, we enjoy making breakfast in so having use of the kitchen was great.","9"
"The place is quite clean, comfortable as shown in photos and centrally located in downtown. 
The check-in process is a bit complicated with lengthy instructions for first retrieving keys and then finding parking. Be prepared to dedicate extra 15-20 minutes for check-in.","9"
"Location was perfect as we come to Montreal annually and enjoying walking throughout the city .  Even though we walk it is located very close to Metro.  Loft was very clean and really appreciated the A/C.  I know it rarely gets hot and humid but it was when we were there so that was a lifesaver!  Everything you need if you decide to eat in and cook.  We eat out a lot however loved that we could make coffee in the am which was provided.  Overall great experience.  Easy check in and parking.  As with most Montreal lofts parking is very tight but my Toyota Rav4 had no issues getting in and out.","9"
"Small but well-located place in Montreal that included (Website hidden by Airbnb) was perfect for our short visit to Montreal.","9"
"The living space at Yj's place is very modern, with tons of natural light coming through the windows! The bathroom/kitchen are a bit less polished, but if you will be eating out more anyway this shouldn't be a concern. The location is undeniably great, being in the heart of downtown Montreal, minutes away by walking from McGill/Concorde, shopping, eating, and across the street from a Metro Station. Very convenient stay for us to explore downtown montreal.","9"
"Great location - lots of problems: inadequate air conditioning, substandard bed, dangerous garage door almost wrecked our car, bath & kitchen dated","9"
"Overall, we had a good stay at this apartment. It was well-equipped with everything we needed, even an A/C unit in the bedroom (very necessary in the summer!) and Netflix on the TV. The host was great with communicating with us, especially giving us a heads up that the parking garage ceilings are quite low (we double-checked the height of our car before leaving to be on the safe side!). The apartment was very clean, although the bathroom is quite old and slightly run-down. ","9"
"Do not let yourself lied to by the ads of this location , you will loose your money and destroy your vacation !","9"
"We loved this apartment as a young couple it was perfect location close to bars and restaurants! The only issue we had was parking our truck but if you’ve a regular car you will have no problem! Overall everything was perfect, the host was very helpful and kind! We’d definitely stay here again. ","9"
"Good value, nice balcony, great location! 
Missing some window blinds, w/ another high-rise apartment building across the street, it makes for a less than private stay. No A/C probably not a problem most of the time, but another story on a hot day. ","9"
"(Website hidden by Airbnb) would say they place is just ok. You’re basically paying for the location near the train. The area was a bit seedy, and there were a multitude of directions to get the keys and where to park. I thought I was on a treasure hunt which sounds fun but after 5 hours of driving, it’s not. (Website hidden by Airbnb) As for the apartment, it is very small and stuffy. The portable air conditioner was basically a fan since it was over 80 degrees in the city and the bathroom was from the 80’s.  Lastly, the garage was a one way, so there was a lot of maneuvering to get in and out. (Website hidden by Airbnb) The main issue we had was they forgot to give us a key to the building so we had to buzz in every time. When we were leaving my partner got stuck in the lobby and had to wait for a person to let him in. When the company that owns these air bnb’s sent me their automated texts reminding me to check out. I messaged back about the key and they “politely reminded me that they had already mentioned that I could just buzz in until 2 am.” They gave us a list of directions to have us check ourselves in without being greeted, the least they could do is provide us with keys.

Also could not access the tv with my netflix account.  Seems it is not connected to the internet and we did not have a laptop, and there are no other options.

Nice touches like tea and coffee and chargers.  Amazing location!","9"

"Let me start by saying the pictures do not do this loft justice!! The loft is huge and was so comfortable for my family and I. The hosts provided my family with THE BEST recommendations, which gave us a local perspective that my family really enjoyed!! The apartment is stunning and was extremely clean. The beds were super comfy and had enough privacy for all of us. The location was simply out of this world - you are legitimately in the heart of Old Montreal and yet the metro stop was steps away which made it super easy to get to the BELL Center for a hockey game! Everything was perfect from start to finish. It has been the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! My family and I thank you Explore MTL!","9"
"Séjour très agréable, à refaire très vite","9"
"The location is perfect. Walking distance to many things especially Old Montreal, and the train is just around the corner if you want to go further. The hosts were also very helpful and responded quickly to any messages. The apartment itself looked just like the images and was perfect to relax in and play some pool before going out. The one flaw for us however was finding parking. There are multiple lots close by, but the attendants were never there so you can only pay for so long in the machine, which required us to wake up at 5am more than once to refill the meter.  ","9"
"We really loved the character of this beautiful big loft, somewhat of a hidden treasure considering the unassuming exterior. Perfect location close to everything, plenty of parking and a metro stop 5 min away! Pros: It has everything needed to cook yourself dinner, awesome pool table, wifi was fast and reliable, bedding and towels were clean, there was coffee and a blowdryer. Cons: no chalk for said awesome pool table, can't control the heat ( it was really hot!) , some utensils/dishes were dirty in drawers when we arrived, hanging your coat requires going to the bathroom, and I swear the upstairs neighbour operates a bowling alley! ","9"
"Visited for one night with two older teens. We loved our hip digs!

The place was spacious and clean. The kids enjoyed shooting some pool during our down time and making coffee with the Bialetti!

Beds and bedding were comfy and cozy. Great water pressure in the shower. We had everything we needed.

Our hosts were very responsive to our feedback and questions and accommodating to our requests.

I would recommend!","9"

"The place was gorgeous with all the amenities you need to feel comfortable. The host was easy to reach and very quick to our messages. Perfect trendy and affordable loft for a Montreal getaway!","9"
"The apartment was great for a guys' trip to Montreal. It is close to everything. Particularly, the Bell Centre is an easy 15-minute walk one way, the old town is an easy 10-minute walk the other way. Very close to metro and large streets for transit to Rue St Catherine and other areas of the city. Note, however, that it is essentially a 2-bed apartment. The couches are not the best for sleeping. The nice modern shapes don't lend themselves to a comfortable sleeping position. ","9"
"Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour dans ce loft incroyable pour une parisienne habituée aux petits espaces. Très confortable, bien équipé, nous n'avons manqué de rien ! La communication avec Matt a été facile que ce soit à notre arrivée ou pour notre départ. Un grand merci. Recommandé sans hésitation !","9"

"The loft was amazing, much bigger than expected and in a great location downtown. The hosts were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend.","9"
"Good location.  At first, it seems a bit outside of the hopping area.  But, the location is a short walk from Old Montreal, Downtown, St. Catherine, and St. Laurent.  The Studio Apartment was spacious and clean... would surely stay there again. ","9"
"The loft was in a great location, right near so many good places to eat and sights to see in Old Montreal. The hosts recommended eating at Olive and Gourmando for breakfast which was a highlight for us. Checking in was very easy, there are parking lots all around the apartment, and it's above a bar if you're looking for that. The loft was clean, decorated nicely, smelled really good, and was comfortable. Thanks Matt and Kaileigh!","9"
"Vaste loft chaleureux bien situé.  Nous avons passé un agréable séjour.  Puisqu'il est situé en plein coeur de Montréal, il faut s'attendre à entendre toute sorte de bruit au cours de la nuit !  Rien de dramatique par contre.  Un endroit où je retournerais sans aucun doute !","9"
"Beautiful loft space!! Looks exactly as pictured,was close to all old Montreal sights. Hosts provided great communication and checked in to ensure we had everything we needed.

"Très bel appartement bien situé. Tout était clair et bien décrit.","9"
"I must say we really loved the space, it was clean and looks exactly like the picture. The kitchen functioned well, we managed to cook 3 great meals there. I would definitely stay here again. It located in a great location close to every where we wanted to go. Thanks for being our host. ","9"
"Excellent location.  Very spacious studio.  Much more fun than a characterless hotel.  My kids loved it!","9"
"We were amazed by how great and beautiful this place was. We felt like it was our home at the moment we entered the apartment. Everything was clean, well located... Everything was on point! I have nothing else to say and I would definitely recommend this place. The instructions were clear and it was easy to communicate with the host. We were happy about our stay there. ","9"
"We had a fantastic time staying here! The place was exactly as pictured and what we expected. Great location for checking out the old port, walking up to Crescent street pubs/clubs and hopping on the subway line to explore more of the city. Decor made for a really cool experience to stay in with a beer and shoot some pool (not a high end table but lots of fun). The double bed was a dream to sleep on, and the queen was towards to firm side (if that's your cup of tea). Fantastic place to make a base for exploring all montreal has to offer! I would recommend.","9"
"We had a really great time here!","9"
"This was our very first family vacation with a 13 week old baby and our stay was absolutely amazing!!! The loft was exactly what we needed and had everything plus more than we expected!!!  The location was great, parking super easy to find and restaurants galore!! Would stay here every single time with and without a kid when traveling to Montreal!","9"
"Place was exactly what I expected. Great location! Love the windows! Great communication with the host and recommend for an active person/group who wants to walk right into the action...","9"
"Such a cool loft! Celebrated a bachelorette downtown, and this was the perfect hang out spot for before going out! Way better than any hotel! ","9"
"J'ai beaucoup apprécié mon séjour! Je suis souvent à Montreal pour le travail et assurément je louerai de nouveau cet appartement","9"
"Fast responding, nice, and great people. Place is very nice and as expected.","9"
"This was close to old montreal as described. It was convienient to take a long walk across the canal and enjoy the old part of the city","9"
"We had a great stay at Explore MTL.  The space was gorgeous and the location was perfect.  The host checked in to make sure everything was covered.  We highly recommend and would certainly stay here again next time we are in Montreal.","9"
"100% recommended","9"
"Great location and Value. Excellent list provided of local restaurants and area attractions although my favourite restaurant in the area, Holder, was mysteriously not on the list. I would definitely go back.","9"
"Place is central and parking really close.

It might be a bit noisy at night as expected by being so central.

The only thing that wasn't 100% during our stay was the cleanliness.  It could have been better.  But nothing that would stopped us from going again.","9"
"The space is located perfectly for exploring all of Montreal especially Old Montreal. Everything was clean and very comfortable for a relaxing stay.
hope to do it again soon.","9"
"Beautiful loft in a beautiful part of the city! Open space made for a very fun stay. I recommend the space to anyone.","9"
"The place was beautiful and clean as advertised. Perfect location for exploring old Montreal! I would recommend this place to anyone if you can manage to snag it.","9"
"The Explore MTL was great as was the flat!","9"
"This apartment was great! The interior is exactly as pictured and there are nice amenities. It's in a good location and the hosts were easy to communicate with and helpful.","9"
"Place was absolutely adorable! Exactly as pictured. Short walk to beautiful restaurants and amazing architecture. Hosts were great as well. Apartment was very hot and we had some trouble sleeping despite the extra fans that were provided. I donthink it was exceptionally warm for Montreal the night we stayed, in the 80s, so this is probably not a normal problem. Still good to consider if you're going to be traveling here on hot days. Overall, absolutely wonderful and would definitely stay again. ","9"
"Explore MTL were quick to communicate and confirm things with, as well as being super helpful.  The loft itself was a perfect space for me and my best friend to stay and I would definitely stay here again.  It is within walking distance to Old Montreal and is in a great central location.  We enjoyed our stay very much!  ","9"
"Awesome unique spot, clean, walking distance to great restaurants.  Hosts were great with information and even made a list of all the spots close by to check out.  I would highly recommend this place to stay in your ever in the Montreal area!","9"
"The loft was spacious, clean, and very walkable to all of the main attractions in Old Montreal. Made full use of the included Roku and mini portable speaker. Would definitely recommend to future guests!","9"
"I only want to stay at this apartment now when I go to Montreal. I've been to many Airbnb's and this was hands down the best ine","9"
"We had a great stay at this location! Thanks again.","9"
"My son loved the pool table. Place was nice. Keep the curtains down to keep out the sun during the day.","9"
"Fun place and excellent location. The host was very responsive and I was able to check-in an hour after booking. Thanks again.","9"
"This place was perfect for me and my two young daughters.  Location was great.  We parked our car in a lot directly across from the loft and didn't touch it for the length of the trip.  We walked everywhere, which was the best way to explore.  The loft was open, airy, immaculate, and had everything we needed.  Checking in and out was a breeze.  We will definitely stay here again.","9"
"This place was perfect for me. I was here on business and didn't spend much time at the listing but it was very clean, had a clean bathroom with plenty of toiletries. The host was very responsive and the listing is centrally located in the city a short walk to Old Montreal and to the shopping. I'll stay here again on my next visit for sure! ","9"
"The hosts were very helpful and had great communication. Unfortunately, the weather was extremely hot during our stay so having no A.C. was an issue. There was one fan for the whole space that was very noisy. The hosts were very accommodating and brought us two new quiet fans the next day. The wi-fi did not work either, so they let us use the wi-fi from the bar below. It was really noisy during the night with people yelling and arguing from the bar downstairs. The place has a unique personality and we loved the decor!","9"
"It's such a cool place with great location. We enjoyed our stay.","9"
"..","9"
"The place is as good as it looks! I thought it might be a little too good to be true based on previous airbnb experiences but the pictures properly represent it.  It's a wonderful space.  Explore MTL are fast and helpful.  We had a great time walking Montreal!  We will definitely have this place at the top of our list when we come back.","9"
"The house was clean, the beds were comfortable, the host was easy to deal with and very responsive. The location was awesome for walking to old Montreal.","9"
"The place is pretty much just one giant room with some dividers. The location is great but the house rules are rigid. 
A high cleaning fee and then they order you to do most of the cleaning work/prep.
The beds are by the windows so the morning sun will wake you up unless you're used to sleeping through that. Street noise is moderate. 
The place was clean and close to the metro.","9"
"Good place. Accurate with the description","9"
"This is a terrific location from which to explore Montreal! The apartment is really spacious and comfortable, and is just as pictured. We felt very safe in this neighborhood. And we were very close to everything in Old Montreal. The hosts were super about communicating - they provided plenty of clear instructions up front and were very responsive when we had questions. Their advance instructions also included a lot of area recommendations, and the one recommended restaurant we tried (Olive & Gourmando) was super. There were minor issues (dishwasher went on the fritz) that did not affect the enjoyment of our stay...stuff like this can happen anywhere. One caveat: if you arrive late (after 11) and park in the lot across the street, you will only be allowed to purchase parking until 5 AM and then will have to return to the lot, at which point you can purchase for a longer stretch (up to 60 hours, as far as I can tell...and we were able to extend after that as well). Everything is very close...you won't need your car.","9"
"Close to all Old Montreal sights and close to Metro","9"
"Great location, spacious, well-decorated loft, and outstanding responsiveness to a small issue that arose during our stay. We would absolutely stay here again!","9"
"Explore MTL made our visit to Montreal a memorable one. We felt comfortable and at home in their space and totally spoiled by their personalized customer service and unique insight of their city (so much better than staying in a hotel!). They went above and beyond for us and we only stayed a night! 

This ""Vieux- Montreal"" loft is spacious, trendy and bright. It's even better than the photos! Creative design, unique decor and eclectic mod furniture - the ideal space for my work vaca with the hubbie. Their home was spotless and well presented when we arrived. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed including complimentary coffee for the mornings and the lovely scented bathroom toiletries were a nice touch. The queen bed was uber comfy (seriously, where did you buy those sheets?!?). The wifi was fast and reliable (which is always important!), they also provided their Netflixs account and a portable speaker for us to use. 

The location was prime, located on one of the major streets in the Old Port. Surprisingly no noise from the street carried into the apartment. The loft was a quiet and cool escape from the bustling city outside.

Transportation: soo easy! We parked our car in the lot next to the apartment and opted for bixi bikes and the metro.

The lovely hosts provided amazing recommendations for the entire city (wow) - they're clearly experienced foodies!!! They were always available to answer our (unending stream of) questions, offer helpful suggestions and were just incredible throughout the entire process! The check-in process was made painless with their detailed instruction manual - which was much appreciated after a long day of travel!

Check- out: Easy but hard to leave!

Thanks again for an amazing stay. We will definitely be back!!!","9"
"Great apartment in a central location!","9"
"This location is a gemstone! Love the spaciousness of the loft and it's coziness. Will stay here again!","9"
"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the New York Style Loft in Montreal- thanks for the great amenities, location and atmosphere. Even put the pool table to good use!  Will be back!","9"
"Comfortable, clean and coo!","9"
"I recommend staying with this host if ever in Montreal. The location was perfect, quiet while a 10 minute walk to the the Old Port where there are tons of restaurants and shops. The decor of the apartment was fantastic and the amenities (high speed Internet, bathtub, coffee press, etc) made our stay very comfortable. Best of all our hosts communicated with us throughout our stay and promptly responded to our requests. My husband and I enjoyed our stay very much and highly recommend this BnB.","9"
"Great place exactly as advertised.","9"
"Perfect location. Great communication. Book it.","9"
"Centrally located to shopping and nightlife, the loft surpassed all my expectations and the host's hospitality was superb. Will be staying there again.","9"
"I'd come back anytime.  Great location, cool spot and had no issues whatsoever.","9"
"Super close to everything you will need to see if your planning on exploring old Montreal. And a truly beautiful loft","9"
"Je recommande beaucoup ce loft, très bon rapport qualité/prix, super beau et bien situé en ville et prêt du Vieux Port et de plusieurs bon resto.","9"
"This place is gorgeous! Close to the old port and great for walking around and checking it out","9"
"The location was great, right in Old Montreal. Unfortunately, we had some issues with our apartment that hurt the experience. We rented the apartment primarily because it was advertised as having a complete kitchen. Upon arriving we found that old food from the previous guest had been left in the fridge by the cleaning staff. The dish washer was also out of service which was not mentioned in the listing. We purchased food the first day of our trip and stored it in the refrigerator. The next day we noticed the fridge was not cooling properly and were forced to throw out our food. The stove was not heating properly as well. Communication with the hosts was good but they were unable to offer any solution to the appliance problems as they were not present in the country at the time. Overall, while the location was nice, we were disappointed because we chose this property due to the fact it had a kitchen.","9"
"A very clean, spacious loft. Perfect location in old Montreal. Just walking distance to restaurants bars and all the attractions old Montreal has to offer. Will definitely be staying here again!!!","9"
"We had a lovely stay, the place looks just like the pictures and the beds are comfortable. This flat is all about location! We walked everywhere! Aaron and Kaileigh were fantastic at being in touch throughout the experience and really made us feel at home. Just a heads up, if you're a light sleeper, bring some ear plugs as you can hear the light murmur of the city at night, something I quite enjoyed, but also the flats above can emit some noise from time to time. Staying in the loft was a lot of fun and perfect for a Montreal getaway. Thanks again Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh!!","9"
"You would be hard pressed to find anything better,space,location,comfort and very safe!","9"
"Clean. Well furnished. Felt like home. Would definitely recommend.","9"
"The host was very communicative, and provided all the information and amenities for a comfortable stay.  They very kindly let us leave our luggage behind to retrieve later even after we checked out.","9"
"What a gem! Kaileigh, Aaron and Matt are terrific hosts, well organized and available. We even received a message part way through our stay to see if there was anything we needed. The loft is gorgeous and well appointed. Exactly as pictured. We were met by Kaileigh as there was an issue with the internet. She offered interim alternatives and solutions and it was fixed the next day.

The neighbourhood is great! Old Montreal and it's sights are in walking distance as are restaurants and coffee shops. Short drive to many historic sights, grocery, and drug store. Everything you need is a short distance away. Parking is easily available right in front of or next to the building. Overnight parking is free on the road. 

Thanks for a great stay!","9"
"Great place to stay!","9"
"Space is amazing. Location is walkable to metro, and places to eat. And the hosts are stingy on recommendations on what to do and where to get great food! 

I do have to admit parking is tough every where. There’s night time street parking. But since we didn’t use the car we parked it in one of the suggested lots. 

We were only two, but we agreed the space is perfect for a group! We defiantly would use this amazing space again!

P.S. the pub downstairs is great for a late night bite!","9"
"This place was great! Would love to stay here again! Exceed my expectations, and will definitely try to book here again.","9"
"Great location and cozy space. We were bummed that the pool table was broken [tilts down on one side so the balls roll all over the place and on to the ground bc the baskets are broken]. That was one reason for booking the place. The floor up on the loft was dirty and when I put my pants on that had been on the ground, they were covered in dust. Made me question the high cleaning fee. But aside from the couple of downs, the place was just what we needed for a couple night stay in Montreal. Easy parking across the street [track the parking attendant down and he’ll tell you what to do] and easy access into the apartment. Cool layout and nicely decorated. Thanks!","9"
"Bel endroit . Très belle soirée en ville. Nous avons bien aimé les petites attentions des hôtes . Merci","9"
"This is the second time that we have booked an Airbnb with Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh and we were even more pleased this time around then the first.

This place was absolutely amazing. Great location, great amenities, super clean, everything about it was fantastic. Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh are always great to deal with. They were in constant communication to make sure that we had all the information we needed. They even went as far as messaging me in the morning to let me know that we would be able to access the place earlier than we originally expected.

I highly recommend booking their place and will for sure do so again in the future.","9"
"Great house. Great location. The homeowners were there is you needed them but were not intrusive.","9"
"Perfect place to stay for 1 night. Beautiful decor and furniture.","9"
"Just like the photo. Studio type apartment but since space is huge (a lot of space!), the beds were segregated well via leveled floor. It has a bachelor’s pad vibe. It’s a walk up but wasn’t a problem since our stroller was compact. 

It’s close to St Paul street where the shops and restaurants/cafes are located. We also walked going to nearby neighborhoods like Chinatown. 

We enjoyed using the pool table. My 3 year old daughter loved the  place.","9"
"This is the perfect space to experience Montreal loft life. The vibe in the loft was very happy and peaceful. I loved the art on the walls and welcoming notes. A perfect sanctuary after walking around the great city of Montreal.  The sheets on the bed were super soft and there were nice touches of the delicious homemade granola and natural shampoo, conditioner and soap.   I recommend this place.","9"
"Absolutely amazing space to spend a few days in. Amazing location and only a few blocks from some of the best ranked restaurants in all of Canada. Highly recommended","9"
"Everything about this space was lovely.  It is exactly as it appears on the site and I would definitely return there.","9"
"thanks","9"
"I would recommend this place. Very cool vibe and fun location. It’s close to the train station. A perfect way to enjoy Montreal.","9"
"在各方面都很出色｡","9"
"Clean, stylish loft! Any issues that arose were quickly addressed.","9"
"Very good stay","9"
"Amazing loft, even bigger than on the pictures, beautiful decor! The hosts were extremely accommodating letting us check-in early. Kaileigh was super friendly and helpful, great communication all around. We loved the place because of its convenience and we would recommend to anyone, it is very well located and a 3 minute walk to the metro station.","9"
"This was a fantastic place to stay! My boyfriend and I noticed the extra work that these three put into their Airbnb listing. And all of them were superb with communication. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","9"
"Great apartment and location.","9"
"The location is great. Right next to one of the best vegetarian/vegan restaurants and when it was -5 outside, being close to Montreal underground was wonderful! Didn’t have a problem with parking and the bed was super comfortable! Loved it here.","9"
"Allways enjoy staying here","9"
"Prime spot!","9"

"The lift was very spacious and very stylish! The communication with the hosts was extraordinary as they answered very rapidly and always made sure throughout our stay that everything was fine with us. Also, the beds are really comfortable! I would recommend this loft without hesitation!","9"
"""Go to"" Airbnb in Montreal. Stayed at M, A & K's lofts in the past & each time my expectations are exceeded. They're constantly updating + upgrading their cs, design + amenities which were already top quality. Since my last visit: they've moved to local + organic bath products (which smell divine), offer home made granola (which is delicious) & provide aromatherapy lamps (lovely scents add to relaxing atmosphere). It's obvious they have real pride of ownership, are focused on their guests needs + perfecting their craft. Their customer service + hospitality are unrivaled.

I'll be back!","9"
"Matt Aaron and Kaileigh were great, very responsive and even ordered new pool cues on my complaint about the state of the current ones! The loft is huge and well located for business or pleasure in downtown Montreal. 10/10 would stay there again.","9"
"It is a beautiful space in a convenient location! Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh were gracious hosts with excellent communication regarding any questions or issues that arose. We did have a problem with excessive noise one night in an apartment above us but that is not to blame on the hosts. They helped us handle the situation and we were able to resolve it. We really enjoyed our stay and would absolutely recommend this loft!","9"
"Another excellent stay+o note that each time there is an addi thought","9"
"C'est une bonne place que je conseille pour se détendre ou bien aller en couple. La place est facile à trouver, les indications sont claires est précises, le service est impeccable.","9"
"Tout simplement parfait!!!!","9"
"Matt, Aaron and Kaleigh are great hosts, attentive and available from before the booking to after the stay. The loft is absolutely gorgeous and nostalgic. The space is much larger than what you would expect from the photos.  Guaranteed to make your mouth drop the second you walk in. A beautiful open concept, great location and quite accessible for parking (street parking and 8$/day). Cozy and stylish, great for entertaining a small group. Highly recommended for your next stay, will make your visit in Montreal exceptional.","9"

Nous allons refaire affaires avec les hotes pour nos prochain voyages sans aucun doutes 5/5 pour se magnifique loft :)","9"
"What you see is what you get. Beautiful loft!","9"
"Gorgeous place with large windows. Had a great time playing pool and relaxing for the weekend. I'm a frequent Airbnb user and this was one of my best experiences. Photos are very accurate and, if anything, don't do justice to the spaciousness of the loft. Will definitely stay here again when I return to Montreal!","9"
"Nous avons passé 48h avec nos enfants chez Matt, Aaron et Kaileigh, et avons adoré notre séjour! L'appartement est propre, super sympa, et bien situé.
Matt, Aaron et Kaileigh partagent aussi leurs bonnes adresses, ce qui est top quand on découvre Montréal. Merci!","9"

"Great space, great location. Spent a few days in Montreal for a couples getaway and the loft was big, bright, warm (it was cold outside) and well appointed. We walked to a Habs game (10 mins) and old Montreal is just blocks away. Outdoor parking lot across the street was convenient and let us pay for all 4 days up front. - $80. McGill street (steps away) had restaurants and a micro-brewery that are great and less touristy than the spots in the heart of the old town. Communication with M-A-K was great.","9"
"Great location to stay and check out Montreal!","9"
"A really amazing loft. So clean and in the heart of Montreal. Perfect place to stay if ever you're in town","9"

"Place parfaite pour séjours à mtl , à 10min de marche de tout ! En plein centre ville !","9"
"Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh’s place is exactly as described, and their hospitality as in the reviews. I booked this AirBnb over others based on the reviews alone and I wasn’t disappointed. 

My husband and I had a mini honeymoon in Quebec and on our way home from Mandeville wanted to see if we could extend our trip by a day and spend a night in Montreal (this is how we began our trip). Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh were so fast to respond and so kind to accommodate us the same day as our request! 

The location was good with a lot of parking options nearby and it’s a close walk to the excitement of downtown Old Montreal! The apartment is beautiful and very spacious in a secure building. The bed was comfortable, but do be prepared to hear the street noises - which is obviously no fault of the hosts.  

The place is clean and equip for a great stay in Montreal! We recommend staying at Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh’s place! The hosts are so friendly and sweet you won’t want to leave.","9"
"Perfect loft for a stay in Montreal. Very clean and well decorated ! An adress to remember.","9"
"Bund pad appartment","9"
"Totally cute and unique apartment, awesome location close to Notre Dame and Square Victoria OACI metro with a Starbucks around the corner, easy parking directly behind the building and super simple check in process. Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh were extremely responsive to every question prior to and during our stay. We weren’t bothered by the noise from the lively Irish pub directly beneath the apartment since we were exploring most of the day anyhow and the neighborhood/building is super quiet once it closes (11pm weeknights, all day Saturday and Sunday). If I wasn’t traveling with a child, I would have been down there myself!","9"
"Great stay, place is perfectly spotted! A+","9"
"Lovely apartment! We enjoyed our time here! Super comfortable beds and a safe location! I would def stay here again! :)","9"
"Loved this stylish loft. Old Montreal is the best location to be while in Montreal - shopping, restaurants and cafes. The extra details for guests are lovely and the hosts are very organised & respond quickly. Perfect stay.","9"
"Beautiful loft located in the area of the old port close to restaurants and nightlife. Loft was stylish and fully equipped. Sofa bed was a bit tricky to unfold and the additional taxes on top of the rental fee make the loft an expensive stay. However, if you have the money you can treat yourself because it was worth it :)","9"

"Great location! Walking distance to anything you’d like to visit in Old Montreal, but just far enough from the center of things to offer quiet, restful nights.
Hosts are very responsive, and helpful with local tips and suggestions.","9"

"The most responsive hosts I’ve ever had with Airbnb. If you are looking for a place to stay where you know you’ll have someone to reach out to with any questions this is your place. Great food nearby, and walkable to so much more. ","9"
"You can expect a lovely, charming space that is
Close to many very cool spots in Old Montreal! We would highly recommend the Bixi Bikes for getting around. They were super convenient and very affordable. McGill Street is awesome for all kinds of food and coffee and only a couple blocks away. ","9"
"Beautiful loft style space in Old Montreal.","9"
"I have stayed in quite a few Airbnbs over the years, and I feel I really hit the Jackpot with this one:
- Hosts: From the welcome pamphlet, to the quick communication, it is clear the hosts are really intent on making your stay as pleasant as possible.
- Location: Situated in the Old Port, we were within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go.
- Unit: The photos don't quite do the space justice; it really is quite impressive. It's clear the space was maintained as if it were someone's home. There is a ""wow"" factor when you walk inside.
- Extras: The unit is stacked full of small extras that make you feel right at home (or better), such as environmentally and ethically sourced bath products.

"Merci pour l’efficacité et la rapidité de réponse lorsque nous avons eu un petit pépin","9"
"This space is clean and close to old town. Our hosts were quite helpful.","9"
"Second time staying here and I just love it.  So easy.  Stylish.  Comfortable.  Cozy beds.  Great location.  I'll definitely be back.","9"
"I had a very comfortable and amazing experience in this very welcoming place. The prompt communication with Matt,Aaron&Kaileigh was very helpful. The loft is as appealing on the pictures as it is in person. I’m looking forward coming back and would highly recommend this place! Thanks again.","9"
"When you first book they provide you with this immaculate PDF showcasing some of the top places to eat around Montréal, as well as one for getting in to the air bnb/parking. Those were beyond helpful, and I’m sure you’ll love those just as much as we did. Definitely a place to spend two nights in if you can afford it; one was just not enough time.","9"
"Try to look for convenience over fashion. No communication was there from the host side.","9"
"Super loft pour passer un séjour en amoureux!","9"
"What a great spot and location!  Loved the decor and the open concept.  The pool table was a great addition.  The kids enjoyed playing, while the parents took time to relax after taking all the great local activities.  The loft includes all that you need, plus personal touches to make it feel very inviting. Great location on the boarder of downtown Montreal and Old Montreal. I loved walking out the door onto the street and being in the heart of the town.  The Pub Victoria is a great little local pub that is hopping which is next door.  It has a good, little outdoor patio for a pint.  Location is perfect (although we did not use the bikes their is a convenient bike rental location (bixi) right out front).  The hosts we very quick to respond to inquiries.  They offered all kinds of support including a professionally prepared introduction booklet (outlining house rules and need to know info) and a separate local activities/dinner suggestion booklet. They are very professional hosts who help to reassure you (as this was one of our first AirBnB experiences). They preempt your needs and provide all the required communications upfront opposed to us asking them for info, They already know what info most travellers are looking for. The only thing to note, is upon arrival, the common area which include hallway and stairs are very dated and not inline with the quality of the loft (yet functional) being a very “Old Montreal” building. But once you open the door to the loft, you are relieved). Great experience.","9"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this loft. It was exactly as pictured and very comfortable and spacious. It was just what we needed traveling with our two children.  All of the required amenities were provided - and then some. We didn’t want for anything.  It was perfect. While we were out sightseeing, the kids would ask when we were going back to the loft. 

The location was great. We were able to walk to all of the areas we wanted to see - Old Montreal, Rue St Catherine, Chinatown, the Port, etc.  This was with no complaints from the kids - a true sign that it was a comfortable walk. When we wanted to venture further out, the Metro was a quick couple of blocks away. 

Aside from place and location, the best part about this rental was our hosts. They were very helpful from the initial booking, responded quickly to any and all questions and were very detailed in their communication. Everything was as they described. Most importantly, they were very gracious. Even when we had a small mishap, they made us feel very much at ease. We have used many vacation home rentals and found our hosts for this unit to be one of the bests. 
We highly recommend!","9"
"We had a great stay at this loft. The place is amazing, spacious and clean.  Full of thoughtful touches that made our stay comfortable. The location itself is perfect, close to all attractions in the heart of old Montreal. The experience was better than we expected. Our hosts were quick to respond to all our requests and kindly accommodated all our needs. 
I would highly recommend this loft. It is a bit on the pricier side but well worth the money.  
A big thank you to our hosts who made this amazing experience possible. We look forward to staying here again!","9"
"Very unique listing in a great location. The building is a bit run down but the unit is nice. The check-in experience was poor due to a wrong address in Airbnb but I’m sure this will be fixed for future guests.","9"
"This space truly delivers...hands down one of the best Air BnB experiences I have had to date!  

Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh have included so many unique little touches that will truly warm your heart.

The apartment provides the perfect base when spending time in this lovely and vibrant neighbourhood; if you are lucky enough to nab this space for your stay in Montreal, you are in for a treat!

You will not be disappointed...","9"
"the New York style apartment I stayed in was very clean & in a prime location","9"
"Arriving to this place we didn’t expect it to look super nice. Although we ran into a little situation it was resolved right away with the help from Kayleigh. She responded very quick and resolved the situation very quick and professional. The parking was little tricky since the one beside the Airbnb could only take cash and was hard to operate. We found parking that was a 4 min walk and was super cheap for 24 hours we paid about 10 dollars. 

I would stay here again!","9"
"This is the first time using Airbnb. I was not sure what to expect but my husband and I were pleasantly surprised.  Matt, Aaron and Kayleigh’s made the whole process seamless. They were in constant communication with us prior to the trip and even during the trip if there was a need. The loft itself was impressive, stylish and comfortable. So much better than a hotel.  Location was wonderful. Old Montreal was more than we expected! Walking distance everywhere! Don’t be intimidated by the immediate surroundings. The loft itself if located above a pub but we never hear anything at all! There is plenty of construction going on nearby but nothing too disturbing . When you enter the loft for the  first time it’s like entering a new world ! Hosts prepared a great food guide. We purchased an MTL passport and saved so much regarding local activities. Cant say enough! Thank you amazing hosts !","9"
"Great location and good hosts. Figure out parking before you arrive as that’s a challenge. Entry not as great as the loft!","9"
"Awesome place, Highly recommend!","9"
"Great location and good value.","9"
"Matt, Aaron and Kaleigh are very thoughtful, communicate thoroughly, and provide  a lot of helpful information about the area, including very good tips for local restaurants.  The loft apartment is very clean, spacious, decorated nicely, and includes a pool table.  The location is perfect for visits to Montreal’s Old Town, and you can easily access public transportation for other areas.  Parking may be a bit difficult because the apartment is in a business area, but we found a good parking lot about two blocks away that is reasonably priced ($11.95CN a day).","9"
"The communication was excellent - anytime I reached out I had a response almost instantly. The location is excellent if you want to  be in Old Montreal.","9"
"Really great room and their services. strongerly recommended.","9"
"My husband and I plus our two kids (one toddler and 8 months) had a very comfortable and enjoyable stay here.","9"
"This was a wonderfully appointed and stylish apartment. Communication was excellent and the pre-arrival information was excellent! Would definitely stay again!","9"
"The location is great, short distance within every single spot, the Notre Dame of Basilica Church, Downtown, China Town and old Montreal.
The apartment is same as I expected, like the pictures we saw.
The hosts are well communicated and response fast.","9"
"Great spot! Check in/out was easy. Cool loft apt with unique layout.","9"
"Please note that the unit is located on top of a bar. Didn’t expect this at all. Although we were asked by our hosts via an extremely detailed message not to make noise past 11:00pm, the band played until midnight and it was extremely loud in the unit. The bar also had music going until about 2:00am in the morning. 

The unit was also lacking on some basic things like wine glasses and coffee machine (only had a press).  There was 5 of us and as a result, we didn’t have enough dishes for everyone. 

However the loft is nice and cozy. Well located in Old Montreal. Lots of restaurants around.  We enjoyed the pool table.","9"
"Great hospitality. Amazing recommendations for food and drink.   Kitchen is well stocked with necessary cooking utensils for a night in. Having ensuite laundry is a Bonus! we would definitely return.","9"

"Very nice place, a pleasure to come back","9"
"A stylish and very professionally managed place. Met all my expectations. Would recommend.","9"
"Great place, as described in the photos although the main door, lobby and hallway are pretty unappealing, the actual loft is great. Instructions and communications were stellar. Had an issue with the unit being really hot and I was told it's because heating is central to the whole building, which is really odd. The solution was to crack open a window. It actually worked but not really environmentally friendly. Would have been great to have some way of playing music. There's a Roku hooked up to the small TV but no Spotify, unfortunately. Overall, we had a great time. The loft and its location are amazing!","9"
"Fantastic place, great location, super soft pillow cases and all the amenities needed. I would recommend this place to anyone I had a wonderful stay. The hosts have put a lot of thought into this apartment and all of the recommendations they made, hope to be back one day!","9"

"Fantastic!","9"
"Great location near Old Montreal, with convenient (paid) parking nearby. The apartment is spacious and clean and the hosts were very responsive. The kitchen is large and relatively well equipped; there is a nice tv with Netflix available. The interior renovation is a bit lacking, and the heat could not be moderated except through opening windows and fans;  it was uncomfortably warm. The beds are on a raised platform without a railing, which may not be ideal for some guests. We did love Montreal and the neighborhood.","9"
"Best hosts in Montreal! We have been renting this loft for 2 years now, always such a pleasant experience with Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh being very responsive, flexible and accomodating. It is in prime location, the layout is well thought out, the decor is modern. 10/10 and highly recommend!","9"

"Second time staying in one of their places and we love our experience every time. I 100% trust that their homes will be a home away from home as they never disappoint. This apartment was as perfect as the photos. Great location, walking distance to everything in old port. Parking was a little difficult as we got there just around midnight and the garages were full. There a few lots around- parked in one and walked back- no biggie. The hosts are amazing too- great communication every time! Thanks Kaileigh, Matt & Aaron!","9"
"This loft has a great open concept and the pool table was a bonus. These hosts are amazing! They have gone above and beyond to provide a booklet of recommendations in the city to explore & have added a lot of nice little touches in the loft! Would Highly recommend :) great location aswell!","9"

"Notre semaine chez Adelyna a été remarquable. L'appartement est propre, meublé avec beaucoup de goût et est très chaleureux : 2 canapés en cuir, une grande télé avec connexion internet et serveur Netflix, machine à laver et sèche linge, etc... tout y est ! Nous recommandons sincèrement cette location. Si vous voulez visiter Montréal il n'y a pas à hésiter car l'appartement est proche de toutes commodités et notamment de la station de métro Fabre. Je soulignerai une fois de plus la sympathie d'Adelyna et de sa famille que nous avons eu l'occasion de rencontrer. Merci.","10"
"L'appartement est bien situé, il est correct propre et bien équipé pour pouvoir séjourné ","10"
"Nous avons séjourné une nuit chez Adelyna.  L'appartement est joli et plutôt chaleureux.  C'était propre et il nous a semblé qu'il y avait toutes les commodités nécessaires.  Nous avions réservé à moins de 24h d'avance mais tout était bien en ordre dans l'appart.  Nous n'avons pas rencontré Adelyna en personne mais elle nous avait laissé la clé à l'entrée avec un système doté d'un mot de passe qui fonctionnait tout à fait bien.  Point négatif à noter par contre, le bloc appartement comme tel est sale et délabré.  Il y avait entre autres des mégots de cigarettes par terre dans la cage d'escalier et on n'était pas rassurés à l'arrivée.  Mais une fois dans l'appartement c'était ok.  Merci Adelyna pour ton hospitalité!","10"

"Adelyna was a fantastic host. She was quick to respond and made checking in and out very convenient. The apartment was accommodating, clean, and very spacious. Having access to Apple TV was a great finishing touch to staying in Adelyna's place. Exceeded expectations for the value. 

The apartment is located very close to the highway with ample street parking. It will be very convenient for guests who drive! Keep in mind to respect some of the parking restrictions though. We didn't think much of it and paid the consequences. Overall our trip was great, we will definitely stay at Adelyna's again!","10"
"logement situé à proximité de tous transports en commun (bus, métro), au calme et près des commerces (resto traditionnel et rapide).
et à côté de l'appart, le meilleur resto de poutine de la ville (primé au festival de la poutine à Montréal) !!!
Adelyna est très sympa, hyper disponible et pas avare de renseignements sur la ville.
le seul bémol, c'est les odeurs du PFK qui se situe juste à côté.
le logement était propre et soigné ... nous le recommandons pour un séjour familial de 4 personnes maxi et il répond à tous les besoins familiaux nécessaires","10"
"Nous avons séjourné chez Adelyna pendant presqu'un mois. La description et les photos sont conformes au logement, avec la gentillesse d'Adelyna en plus :-)

L’appartement est très bien situé et très propre, on s’y sent très bien. Je recommande entièrement cet appartement ! Merci encore Adelyna","10"
"Adelyna's place was such a lovely home to stay in for a first-time trip to Montreal! It was located on a Main Street about 30-45 minutes outside of the main downtown/city area. Easy access to bus routes! The apartment was prepared with all the necessities (and more!) for bathroom and kitchen supplies, and the living room and bedrooms were stylish and homey. Adelyna was attentive and quick-to-respond to our needs and questions. Overall a great stay! ","10"

"Barbara was an amazing host! She communicated fast and really clearly. Her place looked absolutely amazing, even better than in the pictures! And it was so clean! We will definitely come back to her place the next time we are in Montreal. Highly recommended! Thanks Barbara! :)","10"
"The pictures are an accurate representation of the place, for a small apartment it is quite spacious. The apartment is very well decorated, with great interior design. It doesn't look like it but the bedroom is open concept without a wall to close it off and the door is mostly see through, so if you're looking for privacy that might be an issue. 

At night, it can get pretty chilly as there isn't central heating so prepare to bundle up. Another issue I had was the noise late at night, because there is on street parking outside the apartment (which was hard to secure a spot), tow trucks would come around and tow illegal park. They normally alert you with loud sirens before actually towing. Then snow plows would follow to clear out big snow banks. This was annoying as it made it difficult to sleep. The neighbourhood also has many interesting characters.

Other than that, everything was good, keys were easy to access, the apartment was equipped with amenities and was clean. Barbara was also very quick to respond to messages. I would recommend staying here with friends as it's a big space!","10"
"Great stay. Clean, quiet, and very well furnished. Pictures are accurate. It can get cold at night in the winter. Definitely coming back when in Montreal.","10"
"C'était super!!! Barbara est ultra dispo pour nous aider et répondre aux questions.  L'appart super propre et dégage une atmosphère sereine. On se sent chez soi. Merci 1000 fois et pour une première expérience Airbnb, ça met la barre haute! :)","10"
"Barbara's place was great and she was easy to communicate with.  He apartment was easy to find and the check in process was seamless.  Her apartment is beautifully decorated and comfortable the photos and listing are very accurate.  It was nice and clean which is important to me.  It's an up an coming area on island but away from the hustle and bustle of the downtown core.  I had a great stay and would definitely recommend it to others.","10"
"A beautiful apartment, has everything you need for a weekend getaway to montreal. Barbara was a great host and available for any questions we had. Would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Had a great time at Barbara's place! Quiet and cozy place with a beautiful layout and great location! Definitely coming back sometime in summer!","10"
"Barbara's place was conveniently located 3 blocks from the metro and 1 block from restaurants & shops. Her apartment was decorated beautifully and she was very easy to communicate with. Would definitely return :)","10"

"Barbara was a great host - responded quickly to any questions and made us feel comfortable! Her place made for a lovely stay :) 10 minute walk from the metro.","10"
"Barbara's place is lovely -- sparkling clean, comfortable and stylish.","10"
"Barbara was very easy to communicate with and quick with her responses. Upon check-in we had difficulty with the key, as it was getting stuck and wouldn’t open the lock to the front door. (We also got confused as to which door was for her apartment - it’s the middle one.) Barbara had already left at this point for her own trip, but she came back, got us in and settled and provided a different key that worked better with the lock. 
My friend and I visited Montreal on a weekend where they were experiencing a heat wave, so not having air conditioning was a bit of a bummer. But the place has two balconies, one in the front and one in the back, so we opened the doors and had fresh air coming in through the apartment which was nice. 
Barbara has done a great job in decorating the place. She’s an artist so it makes sense. It’s definitely a cute and stylish spot and friend I left with inspiration as to how we may want to decorate our own places! :) 
Thank you again Barbara for letting us stay at your apartment. We loved the pace and would definitely come back. 
Ps. Love your artwork!","10"
"Barbara's place is stylish, spacious and very lovely to stay at, we had the whole place to ourselves and check-in/check-out was very easy. Parking was easy to find on the street, and it had everything you need. Barbara was very responsive, and even though it wasn't her fault that there was a power outage during one of the nights, she helped us find out about the duration of the outage in the middle of the night. Very helpful and friendly host!","10"
"Barbara's place was fantastic! Beautifully and thoughtfully decorated, clean, and bright! The bed was so comfortable and i really enjoyed starting my day relaxing on the back terrace. Barbara is very quick with her responses and kind. :)","10"

"We really enjoyed our stay at Richard's place. His apartment was super cozy and had everything you need (good internet, heating, a comfortable bed, clean towels etc.).

We particularly liked how green the apartment was, with a wide array of plants in the living room and kitchen.

It was in a very nice quiet area which was close to nice places to eat and drink. It is also super near a park, which we would have enjoyed in warmer months :)","10"
"It was a snowy, rainy and gray few days in Montreal but Richard’s home was a peaceful respite to the foul weather outside. It was a great place to unwind and relax after my busy days at a wine conference. A very homey feel and a lot of charm, sort of the antithesis of slick and modern (which can be a bit soulless.) I didn’t get a chance to meet Richard but he was very responsive to any questions I had and gave me a warm welcome.","10"
"Richard’s place is really cozy and sweet. The environment is quite and provides convenient access to supermarket and public transportation. I love the vintage style of this house and all the green inside. A wonderful stay here, Mary Christmas to the hosts!","10"
"A very nice place, well located to move around in Montreal. Richard is nice and very reactive. I could only recommend.","10"
"Antoine was a wonderful host, always responding in a general timely manner, and his place was great. The location, the cleanliness, the size, etc. we're all amazing and made our stay very easy and enjoyable.

"I recommend this apartment without hesitation.  We had a great stay! The place was clean and so spacious!  The location is unrivaled!  And what can I say about the host's responsiveness - simply EXCELLENT!  Can't wait for our summer visit - I hope we can stay here again!  Thank you to our wonderful hosts!","9"
"Great place! Clean, spacious, and close to all the best streets for shopping, food, and nightlife! Only complaint was the beds were crazy uncomfortable. ","9"
"A very large, clean apartment, located right in the middle of the Plateau.  Antoine was prompt and helpful. ","9"
"What a great host.  I left my computer mouse behind and Antonio had it mailed to me.  Above and beyond for customer service.","9"
"très bon logement. bien placé et propre.

"We had a great stay at Antoines place. It is a very spacious and clean apartment and is perfectly located to everything you could think of. 
Antoine was super fast in answering any questions we had.
Totally recommended!","9"
"Do not be wary of the exterior of this place. Very safe area.","9"
"Très bon emplacement dans Montréal proche du centre historique, à proximité des transports en commun (métro et bus), restaurants, magasins d'alimentation... Quartier très sympa et cool sur le Mont Royal. L'appartement est plutôt spacieux, très propre, quoique un peu sombre du fait d'un 1er étage sur cour (pas gênant quand on se ballade toute la journée), bonne literie. Une terrasse très agréable en été pour prendre le frais.  Un hôte formidable, Antoine, toujours prompt à répondre à toutes les questions. ","9"
"Excellent location. Walking distance to some great bars & restaurants.","9"
"Location is great, finding a parking spot might take some time (busy weekend) ...","9"
"A great apartment in the middle of town, very nicely set up and Pereira was very easy to communicate with. ","9"
"The apartment has a very good location. It is around the block from one of the famous poutine places in the city.

Antoine was very communicative and responsive. The apartment is spacious and clean. The covered balcony and large bathroom are great and were much appreciated. 

We were total 4 people and the sofa bed was appropriate. We would highly recommend staying here!","9"
"We really enjoyed being there. The apartament is just like the photos and the location was perfect. Close to restaurants, public transportation...

Antoine was very kind with us.
We certainly recommend the place.","9"
"We would definitely stay there again.","9"
"My mom and I headed to Montreal for her first visit to the City and we couldn't have stayed in a more central, well placed, nicely appointed condo. The location was absolute perfection! The condo itself was so clean and quite spacious. I will say, if you plan to make meals, please bring your own condiments since this condo does not provide them. It does have a fully equipped kitchen though.  We came prepared (minus salt and pepper!) but others may not, so just something to keep in mind. I certainly hope to come back again soon, with the husband this time!!","9"
"Emplacement pratique pour visiter Montréal. Compter 40 minutes pour rejoindre à pied le vieux Montréal. 
L accès à la colline du Mont Royal est très proche ( 10 minutes à pied )
Appartement correct, très bonne literie.
Peu  de matériel  dans le coin cuisine.
Aucun produit de base fourni dans la cuisine.
La location est proche du Bd St Laurent très commerçant où vous trouvez (Website hidden by Airbnb) autres types .","9"
"Great clean place. Close to many restaurants, clubs and stores. Only issue we had was parking. Would definitely recommend!","9"
"Appartement propre, spacieux agréable et confortable. super quartier animé, branché à 2 pas du parc Mont Royal à 15 mins a pieds du metro et 40 mins de la rue Ste Catherine si vous n'avez pas peur de marcher!! je n ai pas rencontré notre hôte mais il est disponible par mail. Attention au stationnement dans la rue PV de 53 dollars , sont passés à 5h du matin.  je recommande cet appartement","9"
"Logement spacieux dans un quartier sympatique.
Un peu sombre cependant.","9"
"Great location on the Plateau and very clean. We needed an iron and one was brought to the apartment immediately! A great host!","9"
"My family of four had a great time in Montreal using this apartment as our base.  The neighborhood has lots of great restaurants, good shopping and convenient access to the metro, Parc du Mont-Royal and McGill. No issue with street parking the week we were there but you do need to read the signs carefully and find spots that don't require resident permits. The apartment itself is as you see in the photos with no surprises. Pereira and Antoine were professional, friendly and helpful.","9"
"Great location and fun place to stay. Thanks again!","9"
"This place was great, no ac but plenty of fans to cool off the place. I am always hot and I was fine. Place was very clean and ideally located. Minor detail that parking was not easy but that can be expected.","9"
"Great place in a perfect location, the Plateau is for sure the place you wanna be. The house is very nice inside and was very clean upon arrival. Would recommend this place to anyone wishing to stay in Montreal. ","9"
"This was pretty much as advertised.   The host was responsive.  The area is up and coming","9"
"The location is great! As mentioned in another review, no air conditioning, but there are fans and there's cross ventilation.","9"
"Great and spacious place! Excellent location!!!","9"
"Location is perfect if you are wanting to be downtown, near all amenities and close to bus lines and the metro. I would like to add however that the comfort of the apartment was low. We never wanted to spend any down time in the apartment. If you are looking for a place for the sole purpose of sleeping - great option. But if you are looking for a place to be able to feel comfortable in the space if you have an hour to chill I would look elsewhere (couch was uncomfortable and smelled slightly, beds were extremely stiff, kitchen chairs were also bad to the point of needing a pillow from bedroom to aid in comfort). During the evening the outside noise travelled into the bedrooms, as if the windows were open, but that was minor considering we were downtown. Place is presented as the photos but our main issue was comfort.","9"
"Good location","9"
"Great street location, parking was very easy, neighborhood is wonderful. Very responsive to messages. I would definitely stay again! Thank you for your hospitality!","9"
"Had a fantastic time in Montreal and that was in large part staying in this wonderful apartment! Would definitely stay here again when I come back to Montreal.","9"
"We had a great stay at this place, it was big and absolutely central. It just looked a little more cozy on the photos than in reality. But if you spend all day in the city, the apartment is perfectly fine.","9"
"Appartement très bien situé sur le Plateau. Les modalités de prise possession et pour quitter, très simples. Appartement super propre. Nous avons adorer notre séjour. Excellent rapport qualité / prix.","9"
"Un agréable séjour. Tout était parfait.","9"
"Super logement, immense. Très bien situé. Lit assez confortables. Seul bémol : mal isolé, on entend les voisins et les voitures comme s'ils étaient dans la pièce.","9"
"Great location. Really spacious.","9"
"Surprisingly cozy despite the minimalist style.. very easy to live in. Secure building in a central area, i absolutely recommend this spot!","9"
"The apartment is very well located - just off St Laurent in the Plateau. The space is much bigger than it looks in pictures! There is also a charming, leafy balcony. Beds were a bit small, and the blinds didn't make bedrooms very dark, but it was quite enjoyable nonetheless. ","9"
"Awesone","9"
"Such an amazing, clean and spacious place to relax in! The rooms are light and airy.

It an amazing basecamp for exploring the Plateau, such a wonderful part of Montreal.

I recommend this place and will be back.

Thank you.

"Great location! Easy check in and check out.","9"
"We have enjoyed our staying at this apartment very much. The location is perfect, and the apt. is spacious and comfortable.  The only thing we missed is air conditioner, which the apt. doesn't have (the listing does mention that, but we missed this info. and it was so hot!!). Besides that, a perfect experience! ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Great place to stay. Clean and awesome location. Would stay again.","9"
"The space was just as listed! Great communication & when I asked for a later check out Antoine was more than gracious enough to allow it! 

The couch & beds are super comfy! The patio was also a big plus. 

Downside is if you are a peraon who gets really hot & heat bugs you there is no AC but fans were provided so our stay was nice & cool! 

Will stay here again no problem!! ","9"
"Emplacement ideal en plein coeur du Plateau Mont-Royal, près de toutes les commodités. L'appartement est spacieux. Par contre, les frais de ménage sont un peu excessifs. Il y a une terrasse qui pourrait être agréable mais qui est laissé à l'abandon et qui n'a pas été nettoyée lors de notre venue. 
Je recommande néanmoins cet appartement.","9"
"As we are not from Montreal a few things came as a surprise due to my assumptions, such as the lack of air conditioning that made for a very warm stay at 30 degrees, and there's no parking available. Do not park out front or you will get a $62 ticket. The host was very quick to respond to questions, the place is immaculately clean and spacious, and it is reasonably close two lots of tourist attractions and great restaurants. ","9"
"Host was really responsive and helpful. Check-in and out was a breeze. Nice big space and the back porch was a nice bonus to have, especially when the nights cooled down after a hot day","9"
"Great location, okay amenities. The space is huge and feels a bit empty. It was very nice to have access to a private patio.","9"
"Spacious and comfortable apartment in one of the best neighborhoods - great to walk around. Check-in and communication was very easy. It was ideal for my business trip, definitely recommend","9"
"The apartment was clean, comfortable and spacious. A bit more decor would help as it was a bit empty and stark but fine for a brief stay and conveniently located. The only issue for us was parking, which is a nightmare like everywhere else in Montreal. We wound up getting a $63 ticket because we didn't check enough of the signs on the street. Even the police seemed confused about the parking regulations. Be forewarned. ","9"
"Great location!  Good value for money.","9"
"We had a wonderful stay here!  We have been to Montreal many times and have never explored this neighbourhood and it's super central.  Huge apartment and super clean.","9"

"Super efficace, grand et propre! Je vais y retourner c’est sûr! ","9"
"Place is very convenient. Photos are not the same as the in person. Not much natural light and it was very dark in the house. Overall is a good stay.","9"
"The apartment was very clean and spacious, and central to some great areas of Montreal. I would come again anytime!!","9"
"We had a great stay. The appartment is bigger that it appears on the webside. Everything was really clean. Nice neighbourhood. The only Thing is That the appartment is a Little Bit sterile.","9"
"L’appartement est super par contre l’hôte ne répond que par téléphone et n’a répondu à aucun de mes 3 mails... ce n’est pas très pratique quand on est étranger et que les appels au Canada nous coûtent cher... sinon tout était parfait et très bien situé !","9"
"good place in the heart of le plateau. note there is a staircase.","9"
"The unit is nicely set up;
The neighborhood is great -- lots of great places to eat, and do other things;
Close to Mont Royal;
I highly recommend this place and if I have a future occasion to be in Montreal, I will definitely try to book here again.","9"
"My daughter and I stayed for four nights at Antoine's airbnb.  We loved the location, the keypad check in was brilliant.  It eliminated the need for keys.  We could walk everywhere from this location.  The space was exceptionally clean and tidy.  The only downside for us was the people who are up above this space.  While Antoine cannot control this, if you're a light sleeper I would recommend taking earplugs.  I slept in the bedroom closest to the front door and didn't notice it as much at night time as my daughter did who was in the other bedroom.  Other than that our stay was perfect.  The Netflix was a nice added bonus.  Thank you.","9"
"Glacial!","9"
"Really big space, lots of room! Very clean. Great location.","9"
"Just as expected. Lovely place to stay","9"
"This is a spacious apartment for up to 4 people in an interesting part of Montreal. Lots of restaurants and bars, but located in a quiet side street.  15 minutes walk from the Metro and a short ride into downtown. Well-equipped for cooking if you need a quiet evening in. We made good use of the washing machine and dryer.","9"
"Spacious but sparsely furnished especially in the kitchen. OK if you intend to eat out. Also you can hear the neighbours above, insulation not great. But Antoine is a great person to deal with, very responsive when you ask for extra blankets for instance","9"
"Spacious flat. Very clean and Antoine is very friendly and responsive.
The flat could be better equipped in the kitchen especially where you can find the minimum. No baking dishes for instance making the use of the oven impossible. But if you ask Antoine, he will bring you what you need.
The flat is lacking natural light. You need the lights on all the time in the living room.","9"
"Beautiful place, a lot of space. Excellent for 4 people","9"
"House is good","9"
"Uninspired apartment with mattresses so old and hard that sleeping on the hardwood floors became a tempting option. One bed slanted and threatened to send you there anyway. The post-apocalyptic back alley where this was situated was very noisy on Friday night. Not a great option.","9"
"Dangerous exterior stair access. Noise from adjacent AirBNB units very loud all night... foot steps from people walking in adjacent apartments (without shoes) @ 2am/ 4:30 am / 7:30 am","9"
"This is a great place in an ideal location. It is close to Mont Royal Park and St Lauren Boulevard which are great spots. The place was tidy and several key amenities were available. Would highly recommend to stay here :)","9"
"A bit chilly but overall a very nicely stay. Convenient location!","9"

"Wonderful location, lots of space, and a clean apartment. So close to so many things!","9"
"Very much enjoyed our stay in Montreal. 
Due to extreme cold and a snow storm was stuck inside for a day, and found the apt nice and comfortable.","9"
"This apartment was just as pictured. There was lots of common/open space, which was great when spending time at the apartment. It was a bit noisy (you could clearly hear outside traffic and other building occupants) but that’s to be expected in a busy part of Montreal. Clean and a great location, would definitely stay here again.","9"
"This was the perfect place to stay to celebrate my birthday in Montreal for the weekend! The location is PERFECT, everything was just as expected and we were really satisfied with our stay - it’s very simple, and you can definitely hear everything in the building hahah but no major problems - it has all the basics you would need and the location is totally worth it! :)","9"
"Great Stay. Nice Place. Would stay again.","10"

"As I mentioned in another section, it seems the apartment was just put up for rental. All of the furniture and items in the apartment were brand new. There are two bathrooms - one in the common area and one in the master bedroom, which was convenient. Given that the rental was brand new, there was remodeling dust on the floor both in the apartment and on the stairs, which I assume will be cleaned up for renters in the very near future. The wifi is shared with the next door apartment through a wifi extender, and there were some instances in which it was less than reliable. However, when we reported any issues to Andre he was there immediately to fix them. I've not had a remote Airbnb property manager ever be as attentive and quick to fix issues, so everything that I listed above pales in comparison to Andre's attention to the property. ","8"
"The location was perfect for walking around the city, super close to bars and restaurants. The house was clean, modern, and very affordable for the location. ","8"
"The location is perfect if you want to be near the restaurants, bars and stores. Is not very recommendable for kids at night, is better for adults. The apartment is big and comfortable for 5 persons. The price is fare related to what you pay.","8"
"Très bon logement, à deux pas du métro. Dans un quartier animé avec quelques bars dans la même rue. Il y a aussi des restaurants de tout type dans les rues adjacente (mon préféré étant le sushi à volonté ""Sushi Crescent""). Le wifi est un peu faible mais c'est super d'avoir accès à Netflix depuis la TV. Nous avons eu du mal à trouver les clés, pensez bien à chercher un boitier avec un code accroché à la rampe.","8"
"The location was perfect and was right next to a ton of bars restaurants and shops. The main issue we had was with the wifi. It was not working the first day but after mentioning this to Andre he did get it fixed. However the signal is still very weak as it is from an extension and was not strong enough to use the tv/roku as these rely on apps and internet. Andre was very responsive and although we were low on soap/shampoo/conditioner he did take note to get more.","8"
"公寓地理位置好,在市中心,到景点很方便｡房间整洁且空间大,设施齐全,和图片一致,谢谢Andre!我们会再来的｡很棒!","8"
"Overall, Andre's place was a good experience. He was very attentive and responded within minutes with answers to any questions I had. The location is within walking distance to many restaurants and nightlife.","8"
"This place is nothing like the pictures. The floors are so dirty you can't walk around without socks or shoes otherwise your feet will turn black. The single bed frame is pretty much broken and barley holding the bed up. The sheets had stains on them and also the master bedroom bed is just on the floor. The smell as well is disgusting. I would not stay at this place again. I would rather be in a one room hotel then this place. Andre was good at first. Always replied back on time but this place is just a mess. Trust me when I say this, book eles where ","8"
"This apartment is in a great central location,  walking distance to shopping and restaurants.     Andre was a very helpful host. ","8"
"This is a huge apartment in the center of Montreal. I rented it for a week because it seemed nice in pictures. While the location is perfect (everything is, indeed, close-by), the apartment needs significant updates.
1) Wifi works from 8 in the morning until 18. Despite reporting the issue to Andre and his attempts to repair it, nothing was done neither on the same day, nor on the following. Honestly, I had a better internet when I was in a poor neighborhood of Mexican suburbs. Absolutely ridiculous for downtown Montreal.
2) Bathrooms are just not-appealing. Yes, they work - but I felt disgusting taking shower there. No soap - even to wash hands!
3) Cleaning was barely done. Floors are dirty (you can see it on your feet when walking - they become dark in 10 steps!). Dishes not washed. Cups are dirty.
4) The entrance to the apartment is actually really sketchy. The cafe on the first floor is so bizarre, my fiance was literally afraid to walk in the building! Plus the amount of garbage on the street in front. Moreover, once on the stairs, the light barely works - really dangerous to go down. Forget it if you have problems with mobility.
5) Everything in the apartment is from the cheapest section of ikea. Literally everything. In one room there is even no bed, just a mattress on the floor. Not that the furniture/towels are bad, they can hardly be re-used for long periods of time.
6) As windows go to garbage bins and a hotel, one morning I was woken up at 6 am by a trash-collector cars - it was really loud and long (approximately 30 minutes).

Briefly, 3 stars are basically given for the location of the apartment, I would never consider staying in it again, and I definitely do not recommend it to anyone, unless you do not mind sleeping in a sketchy place with dirty showers and kitchen.","8"
"Andre's apartment was just what we needed for a guys trip to Montreal, location was perfect, right beside a couple pubs and 3 brasseurs. If travel needed, you can rent bikes right across the street. Kitchen and living room were big and spacious. Theirs a small balcony in the master bedroom, which also has bathroom with shower in it, other two rooms consist of a double bed and a single. Other than that, this place is right downtown Montreal.","8"
"Great location and a great value, the host Andre tended to our needs promptly. It is older building and could use some upgrade and he seems to be working on it. The beds were new and quite comfortable, and so are the washer and dryer.  ","8"
"Fantastic location and a great host. Place doesn't have AC and has questionable construction throughout. Apart from that, it's a great value and I highly recommend it to most. ","8"
"This is a good location for all of the downtown, and it will accommodate quite a few people at a modest price. 

However, it's an undesirable dark entrance and spartan (if effective) furnishings, no-character Ikea basics. I've left laundry detergent because there was none. ","8"
"Andre's place is literally in the heart of downtown Montreal. It's very very close to the shopping street & bunch of restaurants and bars. It's pretty clean and specious too. My only complaint is that the apartment doesn't have AC, so if the are coming during the hottest days of the year in Montreal like us (35+ Celsius), the apartment would feel a bit hot to stay during the day time. But, the host does provide a small fan for each bedroom. Overall, combining the location and price, still very recommended this place for group of people to experiencing MTL!","8"
"Place wasn't very clean, location is good. Poorly furnished.","8"
"Appartement qui convient parfaitement pour des jeunes (18-25 ans), emplacement parfait pour sortir et profiter du centre de Montréal et des sorties nocturnes 
L'appartement est très spacieux mais le manque d'entretien et de nettoyage est flagrant. ","8"
"Great location, right by all the nightlife. This place is above a hookah lounge. If you are looking for fancy this is not it but otherwise it's fine. ","8"
"The apartment is big and centrally located. We came for a conference and it was a very practical and accommodated 4 people for a modest price. The place is not fancy but very practical","8"
"The apartment location is great. However, the apartment was not as clean as I would have liked. ","8"
"Es una zona ruidosa de muchos bares cerca y los fines de semana se escuchan en la madrugada personas hablando fuerte, por la mañana temprano nos topamos con gente borracha fuera del departamento

La ubicación es buena por estar en el centro de la ciudad, amplio

"You can go downtown  easily and the house is good to stay!! Very nice and beautiful~!","8"
"Central location and ample space.","8"
"We booked the apartment for 1 week, during Formula1 week in Montreal. I did not stay/see the place - the comments of my team (people in total)
Location:
Was good, central & convenient, area was cool (outside it was a bit dilapidated)
Cleaning = Cleaning and general, is not that it was dirty but sloppy; the fact of not having any cleaning service or new towels during the week should be took into consideration for future apartment stays.
Easy to access with the codes - no key needed.
WiFi good 
Dave was very kind & quick with answers, we do wish him all the best and thank you for all.","8"
"The house is spacious and clean.
Downtown is just nearby, with number of restaurants and shopping places.
You can even go to Old Montreal in 15 ~ 20 minutes by walk.
The host is very kind and is prompt to respond to inquiries.
Everything is smooth with this place. Thanks!","8"

"The host was easily available and answered any and all questions promptly. The loft was beautiful and well lit.","9"
"This apartment is very clean, stylish and up-to-date.  I highly recommend it.  The neighborhood is a lot of fun too - Rue Wellington, two blocks away, is a bustling, gentrifying (but not yet ruined) street with lots of funky small businesses, restaurants etc.  Catherine responded to my communications immediately.  A wonderful base from which to check out a great city.","9"
"appartement très propre et proche d'une station de métro!","9"
"A perfect location for an escape to Montreal. Close to public transport and easy to drive to with plenty of street parking. Very friendly and safe neighbourhood. The apartment is better than the photos; large and bright throughout. Shower is like a spa! Bed is really comfy and kitchen is very spacious and easy to cook in. We will definitely return to Catherine's, when we come back to fabulous Montreal!","9"
"newly renovated and very bright clean space.  Central to all that is happening in Verdun and nice quiet neighborhood.","9"
"Un lugar muy limpio.","9"
"A great place close to public transportation. Was able to reach Catherine very easily,","9"
"This place was absolutely perfect! We were here for the May Long Weekend and it was such a great experience. The place is well equipped with everything you need! The bed is comfy and the place is very modern and beautiful! Transit is close by which makes it easy to get to downtown Montreal. The area it is located in is very friendly and has many places for you to dine or check out! 
It was such a great time and we will definitely try to book Catherine's place again the next time we are booking a trip to Montreal! ","9"
"Thank you so much ! Our stay in Montreal was fantastic Catherine was both very pleasant and there for any questions or help we needed, I stayed at Catherine's apartment with my 10 yr old son and a friend over the Canadian F1 championship weekend. We found the area to be great for both us and my son, we had great restaurants near by and a parks to walk/play in. Parking was plentiful and if you was unlucky not to get a space directly outside the apartments you could find one close by. Overall we enjoyed the stay. Only one thing could make it more comfortable and that would be A/C, they may have been this but I was not able to locate the controls but this should not stop you booking a very nice beautiful apartment with a very  good host ","9"
"Très bel appartement bien situé et calme","9"
"Nice flat in lively neighbours","9"
"Catherine's place was perfect for my stay in Montreal. The space was clean, comfortable and conveniently located in the lovely community of Verdun (~20 mins to downtown Montreal). Communication was efficient and timely and pretty sparse since everything was easy to locate in the studio. I look forward to staying there again next time I am in town.!","9"
"Having never been to Verdun before, we were not sure what to expect. We ended up loving the apartment and area and didn't even make it into the city or Old Montreal. There is lots to do and explore on foot and by bike (using the Bixi bike rentals located around the city). We loved a local restaurant that is just around the corner called Piquillo Bistro. Food is delicious and the owners are extremely friendly. The apartment was the perfet place to finish a long day. The bed is very comfortable and communication was with Catherine very quick. Would definitely come back!","9"
"Great location and space!","9"
"Appartement bien situé dans un quartier calme . Fidèle à la description et très bien équipé . Merci à Catherine pour sa disponibilité.","9"
"Great spacious loft. The check in was straight forward and Catherine communicated in both French and English. It's so close to public transport and restaurants and in 5-15 minutes  you're on either side of downtown Montreal.","9"
"The apartment was very neat and nice, well  aquipped, not far away from the city center, we enjoyed it! The little communication we had with Catherine was pleasent and efficient. Definitely would stay again.","9"
"This place was very clean, cozy, and perfect place for a couple to stay!","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Great apartment in a great location! Steps from a trendy street with all the shops you could need, tons of cafes and restaurants. Two blocks from a great walking/running/biking path along the St.Lawrence River! Three blocks from two metro stations that connect you to the downtown core in minutes. The area is very safe. As a single female, I lived here for just under a month and never felt anxious walking at night. The apartment is beautiful, lots of modern touches and basic kitchen facilities. Would highly recommend booking this loft - and would book again myself!","9"

"Horrible horrible experience!! This apt. totally ruined our vacation in Montreal. We had just came from another airbnb in Quebec City that was just amazing and above expectations and landed in a dirty, small and noisy airbnb with a host that had no sense of hospitality at all!. The floor was sticky, the dishes were still in the dish washer, the bed was not made and only had 2 pillow covers out of the 4 and they smelled like a sweaty man, there were only 3 small towels that were stained and did not smell fresh and were also located in the kitchen?? There was a nutella pot outside full of cigarettes. You could hear every step and laugh from the neighbors upstairs. Even though this was not unavoidable for the host she should still warn the guests about it. The 2 bar chairs in the pictures were not even there and there were many light bulbs that did not work. So what you saw in the pictures was different in person. There was no closet available to the guest so we had to keep everything in our suitcases which made the apt. even smaller. There was no toaster, water cooker nor a coffee machine. Just essential things!! So we had to literally go out for a cup of coffee. The trash can didn’t even have a bag in it. It was literally walk in clean and tidy up the apt. (That’s not even yours to begin with) before we could actually get some sleep. We left after 3 days in stead of staying our full 6 days and only because there were no other airbnb’s available in such a short notice and we had our 3year old daughter with us. Other wise we would not have minded sleeping in the car, at least the car was clean!. We were only refunded €61 out of the €452 even though we only stayed half of the time!. It honestly felt like a rip off and scam. When we contacted to host about our complaints and that we were leaving earlier she said she was sorry and that she would contact the cleaning company to see were it went wrong and get back at us with a solution. We never heard from her again!.","9"
"Upon arriving at this home, all of the garbages were full, and the bedsheets hadn’t been washed. Fortunately, this was the only downside to our experience. We contacted the host and received a prompt response. Under the circumstances, the host was extremely apologetic and dealt with the situation well. It seemed to have been a miscommunication with the designated cleaners. 

Despite this, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The pictures are identical to what the place looks like in person. There are several places to eat and shop within walking distance. This place also has a balcony which is quite spacious especially considering the location of the home. Parking is available, however there is one particular day of every week where parking is prohibited from 9:00-11:00 AM. We ended getting a $62.00 ticket because we were unaware. As long as you pay attention to the signs you will be fine. Overall we would certainly recommend staying here, and we plan to book this home again in the future. ","9"
"Catherine' airbnb is the best one I had the pleasure to stay at ! Neat, clean, totally equipped -better than expected-, at 5 minutes walking from the stores, the metro station,  coffee shops and restaurants. You get to be in one of the loveliest neighbourhood of the city and still at 10 minutes by metro or car to reach downtown and the main attractions. Oh and it's near the St Lawrence river !!!! Book and don't hesitate, Catherine is helpful, courteous and professional. ","9"

"I stayed at Ben's place for about 5 days and really enjoyed it. The place was great and exactly as described but what really stands out is the host. He made the stay a smooth experience with any questions sorted right away. He went far and beyond to accommodate any request with great attention to detail. There was an instance where his integrity would come under a test and let me tell you, the guy is trustworthy. Would definitely stay again and recommend anyone!","9"
"Un studio pratique vu les installations et l'emplacement. Mais petit. Bon rapport qualité/prix.","9"
"Had a great stay at Ben's apartment. Very central, and looked exactly like the pictures! Would stay again!","9"
"The apartment location is near Concordia and guy station which is perfect. Ben is a nice guy we had few hrs delay he s been nice to us. The room is very clean","9"
"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Ben en personne mais il a été à l'écoute et bien présent par messages pour nous assurer une bonne arrivée dans son appartement. 
L'appartement 1 pièce correspond plutôt bien aux photos, il est au 3ème d'une grande tour de 23 étages, avec piscine/sauna et salle de sport au dernier étage (auxquels nous avons accès en libre service et qui sont supers !)
L'immeuble est bien situé, au pied du mont royal et à quelques mètres sur métro Guy Concordia et de la rue Sainte Catherine. 
C'était une très bonne expérience que nous renouvèlerions avec plaisir !
Merci Ben !","9"
"Appartement très propre et très bien situé !","9"

"Ben's place was awesome, his instructions for check in / parking were super clear and easy. Location was perfect for exploring downtown, would definitely stay at Ben's spot again!","9"
"Perfect cozy bachelor pad that was centrally located. Free parking was such a nice perk since Montreal has a lot of parking meters.","9"
"Bon rapport qualité/prix, des belles  commoditées et un bon emplacement dans Montréal. ","9"
"The place was perfect for our needs and the parking off the street was big, arriving as we did just before a big snowstorm.  The location was great for nightlife downtown and only a block from the subway. We took our time choosing the place and were glad we did. Also, Ben was quick to respond and checked in to make sure everything was going well.  ","9"
"Not my first time in this building; great location.  Apartment was spotless.  Easy check-in.  Terrific parking option.  Nice little touches like can of ground coffee next to coffeemaker - not as common as you'd think.  Will stay here again.","9"
"Bens place is brilliant location with a convenient parking place to go with it! He is very good with communicating and was willing to help with anything! Thank you again. Perfect, host for me!!","9"
"5 stars","9"
"Very nice place. Wifi worked well and super close to the metro. Loved my stay.","9"
"Ben's place is handy for shopping and walking on the West side of Ste Catherine in downtown Montreal. The apartment is clean and parking is easy to access. There are many restaurants nearby, so once you've parked, it's easy to explore Montreal on foot or by metro. I think the space is much better suited to 2 people than to 4 (open concept), but it would be doable it you were 4 friends on a budget.","9"
"Awesome value!","9"
"Ben was a great host. Easy to communicate with. His place was nice and in a great location. Walking distance to a lot of places. Parking was very convenient.","9"
"This apartment was perfect for what we were looking for. Not only was it clean, it was well stocked, and in a great location. The parking spot was an added bonus for us because we drove to Montreal. Ben was a fantastic host who was easy to get in touch with before, during, and after our stay. St. Catherine was a 2 minute walk away and had tons of restaurants and great bars to offer. I would highly recommend this location to anyone who was looking for a decent place to stay right in the heart of the city.","9"
"Cute little apartment, close to everything essential.. great place to stay!","9"
"Ben has a great place - parking and public transit were easy!","9"
"Nice, private studio apartment, conveniently located within walking distance to the subway.  We never actually interacted with Ben, but were able to message him while there and received a quick response. thank you for letting us stay at your place!","9"
"Very cute and clean apartment right in the heart of the city. Easy access to the metro was incredibly convenient and lots of shops and good places to eat nearby. Parking was convenient. Bed was super comfy too! Ben was a great host and helped out if we had any questions. Would highly recommend!","9"
"Ben's place is perfect for couples who are looking for a cozy spot to stay in downtown Montreal. It's clean, it's quiet, and it looks exactly like it does in the pictures. It comes with a lot of amenities, and the Wi-Fi works very well. Ben's place came stocked with soap, shampoo, toilet paper, towels, a hair dyer, and even an ironing machine. The free parking is extremely convenient for guests driving to Montreal; however, I do caution those with taller vehicles (like raised trucks) since the ceiling of the garage leading to the outdoor lot didn't seem that spacious in height. We were able to park and leave our car in the same spot for the entire duration of our trip while relying on the metro station that is one block away to get around the city. Ben's place is also conveniently located two blocks away from Sainte Catherine Street which has a great variety of shops and restaurants all within walking distance. Ben was very polite and quick to respond to any questions we had. His check-in/check-out instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I would absolutely recommend booking with Ben. Thank you again for the wonderful stay!","9"
"Great value and great location. Close to Guy-Concordia metro station, convenience stores, SAQ, tons of restaurants, etc. Quiet at night but some traffic noise during the afternoon. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comfortable stay for nearly half the price of an average hotel room. Great communication from the host as well!","9"
"Ben was really nice and accommodating. Communication was superb. The location was also central and close to a lot of restaurants and essential places. The free parking was also really helpful since street parking is quite expensive and limited. The building is quite old and the other tenants on the floor did not maintain their units so the smell of smoking is very evident. The unit itself is pretty clean so that was good. Overall good experience. Affordable price with decent stay/unit.","9"
"Ben's place is nicely located in Montreal in a trendy part of town. Ben's communication throughout was excellent. There are many restaurants and bars within walking distance of his place. The apartment itself is in a quiet building and has all the necessities for a comfortable stay. The place was clean and easy to find. The biggest advantage is that you get secure parking included with your stay, so if you are driving into town definitely great. Thanks for a wonderful stay!","9"
"Ben was very clear and conscise with his instructions. Check-in/check-out went seamlessly. Great neighbourhood, close to all amenities, good food spots, metro and bars. ","9"
"Great place to stay while visiting downtown Montreal.

Ben is a great host, he makes it easy to settle in and answers right away to any questions.

The place had everything you could need for a short stay and was very clean.

I would stay there again anytime.","9"
"Met all of our expectations, loved our stay!","9"
"Very nice apartment in a good location!","9"
"Ben's place is right downtown, a block away from the subway station, which is a great location (free parking was great too).  Throughout, Ben was very responsive to our questions, and the process was easy and simple; he is very easy to work with, and definitely recommend his place for anyone looking to visit Montreal.","9"
"Ben A est un hôte très accommodant. Il répond rapidement au message et s'assure que tout est en place pour un séjour réussi ! Le stationnement est un plus ! Merci !","9"
"Good location that was about 5 minutes from the metro. The apartment looks like the photos and was spacious. The only downside is that it smelled strong of cigarettes from the neighbours. Neighbours are loud until late at night - some times as early as 3am.","9"
"Ben's apartment is exactly as pictured and described, really clean and the location was perfect! Communication with Ben was super easy, and he was really understanding of our unexpected very late arrival into Montreal. Highly recommend!! ","9"
"The communication with Ben was fast, clear and we had no problem with the check in or finding our way around. He wrote out the instructions that we could refer back to and it had all our questions answered and made us feel comfortable. The space is what you see in the pictures and there were no surprises-  just good ones like the mini coffee maker. 
The location was perfect and parking was easy. We had a great weekend! Thank you. ","9"
"Wonderful, clean apartment in a great location. It's walking distance from pretty much anything you could want. The neighborhood is nice and hip. Free parking and Netflix is a nice touch. I really enjoyed my stay. Ben responds very quickly to messages and is super helpful! ","9"
"The location was great. The room was cozy and clean. This wasn't my first airbnb experience and it was excellent. The metro down the street is very helpful! There are also a ton of restaurants a few blocks up on crescent and bishop street. Very easy to get around and find your way to any spot in Montreal including the botanical garden/biodome, old port and other spots down town. Overall great experience!","9"
"Ben's place was in a great location!","9"
"Great place to stay. Nice and close to saint Catherine street.","9"
"Communication with Ben was helpful and thorough, he responded almost instantly to any questions. The apartment was clean and cute and centrally-located. Parking was really convenient too. We loved our stay!","9"
"Ben was a great host. We had a small issue at the check-in but ben quickly fixed it. The apartment is awesome, it's clean, well furnished, located 5 mins walk from subway station, grocery stores, cafes and bars. 
I would recommend this place. ","9"
"Great part of town, quiet street but only a block from nightlife and great restaurants. Good size and clean apartment with a good view of the Montreal streets! Will be back for sure. ","9"
"Apartment was very nice and well-furnished.  Communication was excellent.","9"
"Clean apartment in a convenient location. Bed was comfy and there was complimentary coffee, which is always appreciated.","9"
"The location of the apartment was good as it was near a metro station and had a convenience store and many dining places nearby. 
Ben gave very detailed instructions so we were able to check in seamlessly. He was also quick to respond to our queries","9"
"Nice, clean place facing a busy street. Convenient parking. Very close to Metro station if don't want to use the car. 
Very nice communication with the host - very helpful and responsive.","9"
"The place was accurately represented by the pictures.  I am glad that I booked this location.","9"
"Ben's apartment is very simple and nice. Although we never met in person, check in and check out was easy and communication was strong. The apartment was clean, easy to find, and the bed was very comfortable! I would really recommend this place. Thanks!","9"
"A wonderful little quiet apt with a good soaker bathtub and a comfortable bed. Oh yes, and really appreciated the Netflix and TED talks channels!","9"
"Ben was great! The apartment was clean and accurate to the description of the listing. After one very small miscommunication, we were settled into the place like it was a friends house. He was extremely responsive and very helpful with travel ideas for my friend and I! ","9"
"Great accommodation and a really good size for a studio flat.  Loved the living room area, which was an extremely comfortable place to have a night in. The AC, though noisy was great when it worked, though it did cut out all the electrics at one point, but Ben was on hand immediately to help rectify the problem.  
Brilliant location; lovely neighborhood, convenience store in the building, walking distance to metro and plenty of restaurants nearby.
Free secure parking on site was a bonus, especially as we relied on public transport after parking up, which was easy to negotiate.
A couple of additional touches would make it perfect; a full length mirror in the room, some lighter bed sheets and shelves/drawers to unpack some clothes. That being said it was suitable for our needs.","9"
"Ben's place is great for those visiting Montreal: walking distance to Bell Center, shopping area, restaurants, Mont Real. A bit on the down side was the noise coming from outside during the night, but that's because it's a central apartment and big cities are noisy. Communication went smoothly, we are happy with our choice. Thanks, Ben.","9"
"Very clean and was exactly advertised , had a great experience and would stay again in a heartbeat!","9"
"This place was nice and clean, close to a lot of restaurants and shopping. I would stay again. ","9"
"This is a terrific location and the apartment has everything you could need! Ben is very helpful and easy to communicate with. Overall a great experience.","9"
"The studio is really well designed so that it feels very comfortable and spacious, and the location was perfect. We loved our stay!","9"
"Excellent location, communication, cleanliness. It was a perfect trip and Ben made sure of it! Thank you!","9"
"Great location. Ben was very quick to respond back!","9"
"Ben was a great host. Very responsive and responsible. His place is very clean and was in a very central location.","9"
"The experience was true to the listing. It's a clean little apartment in a lively neighborhood. We brought a tandem bike with us and it was stressful because it was too large to fit in the elevator. We could not find a bike rack and ended up locking it to the fence behind our parked car. Fortunately it was not stolen out of the secure lot but it was a worry for us. Tandems are extra big and heavy. Perhaps a standard bike would have fit in the elevator just fine. The apartment has a balcony & we could have stored it there.","9"
"Loved staying at Ben's apartment. He was always very quick to respond and we really appreciated his attentiveness. On top of that, his home was quaint and cozy and in a very convenient location! We walked to many different areas from the apartment. Bus stops are nearby as well. It was extremely convenient and comfortable. Ben was extremely helpful in recommending us places to visit and even accommodated us arriving a bit earlier so we didn't have to carry our heavy luggage around. Loved visiting Canada and loved being able to stay in this cute apartment. I'd definitely recommend.","9"
"Great visit.","9"
"Ben was a great host, always available to answer any questions I had and was very accommodating during my stay. I was traveling from outside the US and I felt very comfortable in the apartment. The location is in a great part of town, very walkable to many stores and restaurants. I would definitely recommend this apartment.","9"
"Ben's apartment was perfect for a weekend in Montreal. Great location, very clean apartment, and very easy check-in process","9"
"My sister and I stayed at Bens place for one night. He communicated quickly when needed but we gave him 3 stars because the apartment was not very clean. The neighbourhood that the apartment was in made us a bit uneasy at times. The overall price was a bit much for the space but the pool and rooftop terrace were enjoyable.","9"
"Great location and very easy communication. We loved our stay here.","9"
"We are really thankful to Ben. We arrived at home after midnight due to our flight. He made no problem of it and even comforted us.","9"
"Appartement très bien situé et facile d'accès :-)","9"
"Bad experience
Noisy neighborhood busy, construction site, smell of weed everywhere in the building. ..
Old apartment 
Not clean at all
Bad furniture
Not sure the linens or towels were clean or any cleaning was done at all before our entrance
Kitchen missing so many tools
And pricy for what is
Instruction was good and adequate and down town is just reachable easily","9"
"Great location and it's as advertised. Ben is great about getting back quickly when you have questions.","9"
"The place was ok, certainly not great. It would've been nice to have a little more than an old dish towel in the bathroom to dry our hands, let alone a couple of actual bath towels. The building itself was the real problem, dingy and run down would be the most charitable way to describe it. Falling down construction foam wrap in the elevator, plastic sheeting covering the carpet in the hallway. Not a good look. 
But for us, the real clinker was when we got there, plastered all over the doors and walls were signs saying the water was going to be turned off from 9:00AM-5:00PM. Totally unacceptable. The signs were posted the day before, and our host should have known and informed us of this. His response was ""It's not my fault!!"" And yes, that is his actual quote.not something I ever wanted to hear from my kids, an definitely not a response I want from a host.  I called Airbnb, cancelled our next day, and thankfully, was able to get a full refund. 

If you're looking for a budget place to stay, this might be ok as long as there are no other problems with the building. Otherwise, if you are looking for someplace nice, in my opinion, keep looking.","9"
"Die Unterkunft liegt sehr zentral, das ist wirklich gut. Das Gebäude an sich ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig aber das Zimmer in Ordnung.","9"
"Ben's apartment was perfect.  I arrived after midnight.  Check-in was flawless.  The apartment was clean.  The air conditioning was already running.  The area is near Concordia College.  Lots of younger people.  However, it was very quiet during my stay.  A close walk to Starbucks and the location of my deposition near the hospital.  Uber drivers were me at the ready, if need.  Good deal.","9"
"We loved staying here. This apartment is a basic studio apartment so if you're looking for a luxury stay this is not your place...but for us it was perfect. We just needed place to crash in Montreal which was one of our stops in a very long road trip we were on. Having off street parking was a huge plus - we parked our car and didn't have to think about it or look at it for the duration of our stay. This apartment is in a fantastic location and we were able to walk or take the city bike system to every single place we wanted to go - museums, Old Montreal, shopping, and restaurants.","9"
"Great location and private parking is a major plus for anyone driving. The pillows were very thin, so be sure to bring your own. The rooftop and pool were nice. There was a lot of construction going on throughout the building, but I didn't notice it when inside my room.","9"
"Thank you for the stay Ben.  The apartment was great.","9"
"Great location! Within walking distance to everything downtown. Ben was very friendly and helpful, highly recommended.","9"
"Good spot! Great location, responsive host. Exactly as advertised","9"
"Great location, easy check in and it was wonderful to have free parking.
Apt was OK, it could use a woman's touch.
It is difficult to walk beside the bed without banging your shins but the bed was surprisingly comfortable. Could use some extra pillows though.","9"
"Nice appartment, as described in the profile. All you need is there. Central location. Very easy communication with Ben. Good value for money and idéal for a short stay in Montreal.","9"
"Great place in a great location. Nice stylish studio apartment in the downtown area...would definitely stay again! Ben was quick to respond to messages and really helpful.","9"
"Great location, awesome private parking (as long as you don't have too tall of a truck or SUV to get in), clean, and great communication from Ben! We would love to visit again!","9"
"This is a great apartment located just outside of the central shopping district. It's conveniently located to a Metro station to take you wherever you need to go. The instructions to access the apartment are clear and parking is provided. The only two complaints is that the pillows were pretty much non-existent and there is not a remote for the TV, which was only a problem because it was on when we got there, but there are buttons on the side to turn it off and adjust the volume. I would definitely stay again.","9"
"Je recommande à 100% !! 
Rapport Qualité prix incroyable","9"
"Niceand easy place to stay. Nothing fancy but great communication with the host and everything was clean and convenient.","9"
"Ben’s apartement was clean (even though some utensil were not from previous renters I guess). 
Communication with Ben was on point before and while my stay. 
There were lots of noise coming from outside and inside the building (but then again it’s Montreal!).
The free parking is really great and easy to find.
This is a wonderful value for being three blocks from Downtown and it was what I was looking for.
I would recommand this apartement!","9"
"Great value, excellent location  ! Amazing experience !","9"
"The studio was very clean and comfy.","9"
"Very good!","9"
"This apartment was in the perfect location - walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the metro! The place was spotless and had great amenities. Would definitely recommend staying here!","9"
"Nice place, good description, well situated in Downtown. Ben was a good host, quick to answer any question. Parking was ideal, if you have a standard car.","9"
"The host is very instructive and detailed, which is a good thing because you don’t need to be left wondering. Clear instructions are given and host is responsive. The place was as expected, nothing less. Overall a good experience would recommend this place.","9"
"This place is in the perfect location I n so many ways.  Great bed, nice couch, next to everything! Could easily fit 4 adults.  
Would stay here again.","9"
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 days from Dec. 29th - Jan. 2nd. This place is amazing, it is very close to the majority of Montreal attractions. For the price, this is a great deal. The subway stop is about 5 - 7 mins walk. Everything is within a 5 miles radius. For those who are planning to visit Montreal during New Year, EVERYTHING IS CLOSED ON JANUARY 1ST. 

The only problem we ran into is that it got a little cold during the night, but nothing too unbearable. The entrance to the parking is a little low, my compact SUV antenna kept hitting the top of it. I can't imagine a big truck or SUV fit through it. Overall, it was great and I would definitely stay here again.","9"
"Excellent hôte, très propre, tout était parfait, bonne communication et très bien situer, je recommandes fortement, merci énormément de votre accueil!","9"
"Great location! A short distance from downtown. Really enjoyed our stay at this location, it was a great spot for our trip!","9"
"Beautiful and clean. Would stay again","9"
"Ben's place is in a great location. It is close to everything and has great amenities and is very secure. I had a great stay and was very comfortable during my entire stay. Netflix was available on the TV and he even had menus for some of the area's restaurants to help make dinner easier. Ben is quick to respond to questions and requests and if I'm ever in need of a flat in Montreal again, his listings will be the first place I check. Thanks for reading and have a great time in Montreal.","9"
"Nice place and nice host.","9"
"Nice place but it wasn’t clear that it was a studio until we got there. Good location. Decent size for a studio, though. Overall, enjoyed my stay!","9"
"Ben's place was easy to find, and the free parking is great! The place is clean and located in an accessible area to many restaurants, bars, and museums. He communicated quickly and gave detailed directions on how to check in, and there is a sauna, right enough said. Safe and clean place. Very happy with my stay, will stay here again next time I'm in Montreal.","9"
"My stay in Ben's apartment was great! It is very well localized, near  many stores, shopping malls and supermarkets. Metro station Guy and many bus stations are close too. Ben always answered me fast, what I really appreciate. Also he was very supportive in my arrival and departure. I definitely recommend his apartment!","9"
"Exactly what the posting says and true to the pictures. Ben's place was exactly what we needed for our weekend trip. Ben was very good at responding and made check-in seamless.","9"
"A nice place to stay in the heart of Montreal downtown","9"
"Ben’s apartment was spectacularly clean and organized as well as perfectly located near downtown. He provided clear and detailed instructions about everything he might need. He was friendly and suggested great local attractions! We had a great trip!","9"
"Super Séjour à Montréal! Un appartement très bien placé pour faire toute la ville à pied, Ben est un hôte très réactif et disponible pour toute aide. Merci encore Ben :) ","9"
"Ben answered all of our questions quickly before we arrived. The check-in process was easy. We found we could walk to lots of place from the apartment and we were so close to the metro as well.","9"
"Ben's place is a in a really central location - walking distance to many restaurants and shops as well as the metro stop. Even though it is in such a central location, we weren't bothered by any noise. The place has everything you need (kitchen utensils etc.) However, the building is very old and you smell smoke, pot etc in the hallways. The apartment itself could also have been a little cleaner. The parking spot was good for us, but I can definitely see people with a larger car having trouble even accessing the parking area. We paid roughly 30 €/ night for our stay. So overall we were happy with what we got for the price we paid.","9"
"Location was spot on. Walked to everything. Perfect size and parking super handy. I highly reccomend!!","9"
"Pour ceux qui arrivent de l'extérieur surtout en auto et veulent rester au Centre ville avec un stationnement inclus très facile d'accès, c'est vraiment bien comme endroit. C'est sécuritaire. Tout est à proximité c'est vraiment un emplacement pratique. A retourner sans aucun doute.","9"
"This was my first experience renting with Airbnb and Ben was great at replying to my questions. The place was as expected and was perfect for what we needed. Right around the corner from many restaurants and shops and within a 45 minute walk of most of the main tourist destinations. Thanks Ben!","9"
"Bien situé. Piscine et sauna accessibles. Logement plutôt tranquille. Difficile à trouver le stationnement intérieur.","9"
"The place is as described. The parking is the selling point of this airbnb. If you are traveling alone with a car, you may have to double park for a few minutes while you run up and grab the garage keys and return to your car. Unfortunately, the hallway leading up to the apartment reeked of cigarette smoke 24-7. I understand this is out of the control of the airbnb host, but if you're sensitive to this smell or have bad asthma, this may be an issue for you. The apt itself kept most of the fumes out. The location was perfect and was walking distance to many great restaurants.","9"
"Appartement bien situé. Proche du métro et de la rue Sainte Catherine. Idéal pour visiter la ville. Le seul reproche que je peux faire concerne le ménage ainsi que les mauvaises odeurs provenant du couloir.","9"
"Clean apartment in a great location. Ben was easy to communicate with, and check-in / check-out were extremely easy.","9"
"Located very good in the middle of Montreal, easy to go to all tourist places from there. Only big issue was with the parking garage. We could not enter it with our car as it was too big. Max car height can only be around 1.78m. We had to park a few blocks away and pay for it extra what wasn’t nice as we choose this apartment in first place because it has parking included.","9"
"Ben is quick to respond and his place is close to the metro. It's clean too! Don't be discouraged if you smell any smoke, it's the other units. Just open the window and the scent quickly disappears. I have bad allergies and was concerned about this at first, but it wasn't in any of the linens or couch.","9"
"Ben’s place was exactly what we were looking for. Good area, metro close by, lots of places to eat and drink all within walking distance. Would recommend to anyone!","9"
"This apartment is in a great location and provides everything you need to visit Montreal. Ben was responsive and the apartment was great. The on-site parking was very convenient as well.","9"
"Logement très bien situé, proche métro, plusieurs restaurants. Température confortable, lit confortable. Excellentes communications avec Ben A. Stationnement gratuit sur place un atout dans ce secteur. Odeur bizarre dans le corridor pendant notre séjour, mais ok dans l’appartement.","9"
"The best place ! so close to everything, right in downtown, highly recommended ! You will love it, we did !","9"
"Apartment is basic and clean. Ben was very responsive to all questions. Check in was easy and instructions were clear. Parking spot was a HUGE plus as it can be costly to park if you have to drive everywhere. Apartment is in a great and safe location near the metro, restaurants and shopping. We walked everywhere. If I’m being picky, investing in little touches would be nice such as better quality towels and higher quality pillows. But as I said, accommodations were basic-not luxurious. Overall a good and very functional launching point to explore and experience Montreal.","9"
"Thank you for being a great host ! we really enjoyed staying there, and we really loved Montreal ! What a great location it was !","9"
"This place was just fantastic !!! Ben was an amazing host and did an amazing job communicating. Ben made it really easy for check in and did a fantastic job in making sure the place was clean, as well as making sure his guests were comfortable and all the essentials were met. The place was in a amazing location and was extremely close to metro stations. So it wasn’t hard at all to venture out into the city and find your way back. Overall, this place was great and I highly recommend it to any couple who is looking for a nice getaway to Montreal. Ben was an amazing host and you can’t ask for anything better. ","9"
"Ben was a great host especially with his communication with us. The location of his place is spot on & very convenient to get around town! Thanks Ben!","9"
"Ben’s studio apartment was located in a great location.  We were there during the extreme heat and the air conditioner worked perfectly at keeping the space cold.  Parking was super easy as the space was a secured outside lot. (You could choose which space to park in). 
This is an apartment building.  The common areas (hallways, elevators, lobby) are not clean.  The shared laundry rooms, however, are super clean. 
Ben was quick to respond to any inquiries we had.  ","9"
"The location is great, and the owner was very nice!","9"
"The apartment was nicely appointed and clean and the location is amazing. The pool was under maintenance but Ben reimbursed us when I mentioned it to him.","9"
"Well located beside the metro. Has a basic kitchen. Free parking for a standard car ( really big won't fit). Has a gym, pool and sauna although the pool was closed for repairs during our stay. Only issue we had was there is a lot of noise coming from the street due to one of the windows being jammed open to fit the air con machine. The next night we could drown some of that out by blasting the air con machine on full but still not the most quiet night sleep. Overall it was a good stay.","9"
"We really enjoyed our stay in Ben’s little apartment. It was perfect for my wife and I. The air conditioning was a life saver in the Montreal summer heat. The apartment is in a great location making it easy to explore downtown Montreal on foot, or taking the metro. I also used the gym, which was a nice touch. There were a couple spots where the cleaning was overlooked in the kitchen, but it was no big deal for us. Ben is super quick to respond to messages, and check in was easy. 
We would gladly stay here again. ","9"
"My husband and I stayed in Ben’s apartment in downtown Montreal for 3 nights and we were happy with the location and the free parking.  Ben was very responsive and provided clear, detailed instructions for check in/check out, parking and the building amenities. The apartment is close to shops, restaurants and public transportation. It’s also within walking distance of the biggest park in Montreal (Mont-Royal), which was a bonus. The neighborhood seemed safe; however, it is very noisy on the weekends!  It seems like many college students live in this area, which is fine, but they can be extremely noisy in the building, hallways and on the street until the wee hours.  The walls and windows in the building didn’t seem to be very insulated, so there was also a great deal of very loud street noise (cars, motorcycles, trucks, people shouting, etc.)

The apartment itself is no-frills, but it suited our purposes for a few days.  Since we stayed in the summer, we especially appreciated the air conditioning.  The bathroom needs a little TLC, but was functional.  I believe the bed was listed as a queen-size, but I think it’s one of the Ikea brand full/queen beds, and it definitely didn’t seem as large as our queen-sized bed at home.  The kitchen was well-stocked with dishes, glasses, etc., and has a full-size refrigerator. Like other reviewers mentioned, we experienced the smell of smoke in the hallway outside the apartment, but had no problem inside the flat itself.  The elevators worked well and were big enough for my husband’s mountain bike. Overall, the free parking and the location of this apartment outweighed the noise and the lack of fancy amenities.  I would recommend Ben’s apartment. ","9"
"Easy check-in, parking and amenities a big plus for the price ","9"
"Emplacement idéale pour visiter Montréal, proche de toutes commodités, appartement propre et conforme aux descriptions de l’hôte. Je vous le recommande!","9"
"Ben’s place is in a perfect location to enjoy the city of Montreal. It was great that it had parking and we fully enjoyed our stay. It’s a great Airbnb if you plan on being out during the day and using the airbnb as just a place to sleep. The only negative was that he had a slow response time to my messages, but once he answered everything went great. ","9"
"Très bien placé, bons équipements collectifs, dommage pour la piscine en travaux et un effort sur la propreté est à envisager, alors ce serait parfait, mais nous avons passé un bon et agréable séjour","9"
"Amazing communication and immediate response times. The location was perfect. Communication is very important to me and Ben was extremely helpful when answering questions.","9"
"Great Location that's it","9"
"This place was great for its price and location. Nothing special just a clean place to sleep while enjoying Montreal. Unfortunately my truck was unable to fit in the parking so I needed to pay for parking.","9"
"Très bien situé","9"
"Ben's place was ideal for our short stay in Montreal. Well located for downtown and for Mont Royal Park. Nice apartment with everything we needed and Ben was responsive to any questions.","9"
"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans l'appartement de Ben A. 
L'appartement est bien situé et très propre, nous n'avons manqué de rien. Il dispose d'une place de parking très pratique. L'immeuble dans lequel se situe l'appartement dispose gratuitement d'une grande piscine, d'un sauna, d'une salle de squash et une salle de sport.
Ben A est très réactif, ses explications pour notre arrivée dans l'appartement étaient très claires et précises. 
Nous recommandons sans problème l'appartement de Ben A pour un séjour à Montreal.","9"
"My parents are seniors and I booked Ben's place for their short stay in Montreal. This review is on their behalf
They loved Ben's place and found it to be convenient, clean and perfect location. They found Ben to be polite, very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions or requests they had. Thank you Ben for being such a great host!","9"
"Ben's place was very clean and quiet. He was very accommodating and communicative and I would definitely stay there again.","9"
"The location of this Air bnb is great however I do feel it came up short on many aspects. The suite was not clean. The bathroom was the worst. The sink didn't drain well and had a terrible smell, the bath mat had hair and nail clippings in it. The shower curtain was brown at the bottom from not being cleaned. The plug to the tub was completely brown and disgusting. Bathing was out of the question. There was two very small toliet papers left that made us have to go purchase more along with soap. The baseboard through out the suite are thick with dust. The kitchen had a dirty stove and fridge. The kitchen is not equiped with the essentials if a person wanted to cook. No cookies sheets for example hardly any utensils. The couch is not comfortable and it had crumbs on it when we arrived. It is listed there are candles but they were completely burnt and the lighter did not work. We purchased our own because the suite bathroom sink had that bad smell. I will say Ben was good with communication and clear with details how to get into the suite. I think this suite has great potential if it was cleaned. I didn't expect amazing for the price but I did expect it to be clean.","9"
"If you want to see Montreal, this is the apartment for you! Nicely appointed with everything you need to make your stay perfect. Easy walking to the downtown area, or a few minutes to the Guy-Concordia metro station if you prefer. An abundance of places to eat within 5 minutes. Grocery stores, parking... If you like to cook, walk 20 mins to the Atwater Market for gourmet everything; detour on the way to see the pretty rue Coursol houses. If your shopping is heavy, come back by metro from Lionel-Groulx station.","9"
"Ben responded quick to my messages and gave clear and easy check in instructions. The location was great, walkable to restaurants and metro. Highly recommended!","9"
"there is better","9"
"Central et stationnement vraiment pratique.","9"
"Great value for money in a central location.","9"
"Ben’s place was great! The apartment was just enough space for what we needed for the long weekend. The only thing that was an adjustment for us not being city people was the noise at night while sleeping, but that comes with staying in any city. Having the convenient store right across the street was a huge plus, along with the free parking. For the money that we paid for 3 nights and free parking to not have to worry about driving was definitely worth it. The location was (Website hidden by Airbnb) was very easy to walk to everything including Crescent street (5 mins away) where there were many bars and restaurants to pick from. Can’t forget about the Netflix being a huge plus too! I would definitely recommend. Thank you Ben!","9"
"Amazing location and a great apartment for renting! The building and the room are kept clean and having a parking space was great as well. I would recommend this apartment for anyone who is looking to stay in Montreal in downtown.","9"
"The space suited our needs well. Very clean and well located in the city. Loved having off street parking availability! Would definitely use the space again.","9"
"Place was fine, check in was easy, but it was freezing cold. Heater was not working and it would not get warm in the place. We were visiting from the states and we did not have data so internet was important for us--the internet kept going in and out so we could not get a steady connection to research.","9"
"O apartamento é bem localizado, mas não estava limpo. Tivemos de cancelar a nossa hospedagem.","9"
"Close to everything. Very good value for the price. Quiet and safe location with parking","9"

"really nice place! I will definitely come back next year!","9"
"Ben's condo is perfectly situated in the heart of downtown Montreal. The space is just as seen in the pictures; however, the shower is very small and the washroom fan does not work. Also, there is a funky smell in the hallway but other than that, it was a beautiful stay. It was very clean and spacious enough for my partner and I. We also had access to the condo's pool, gym, and squash court which was awesome! Free parking was also a bonus! We would definitely stay here again. :)","9"
"It’s a great location, Ben was a very good host. He responded to messages very quick. Value was great too.","9"
"fabulous experience","9"
"There were stains on every piece of fabric, the sheets were dirty, there were only two towels provided and they were old and ratty. The building needed a lot of maintenance. The walls were so thin you could hear the phone vibrating next door. There was also a little yappy dog next door that barked almost constantly. The hallway smells strongly of smoke amongst other things. The drinking glasses were broken. The furniture was rather cheap and extremely basic. The balcony had trash and cigarette buds strewn on it. There was mildew in the shower. This was not worth $75 a night plus the steep cleaning fee. I’ve never left a bad review before but this place was so disappointing! The free parking, easy check in, and close proximity to the metro and Tim Horton’s were nice.","9"
"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Ben's place. The location is great and it was one of the more budget-friendly options. The reviews were so good I think our expectations were a little too high. In retrospect, we should have known there would be some compromises. The building is not so nice once you get past the lobby. The elevators and hallways often smelled of cigarettes and generally didn't seem very clean. The apartment itself was dark and had a slightly musty smell. It was clean except for some crumbs on the floor and couch, and the bedding which didn't look like it had been washed. We asked for it to be replaced, though, and Ben took care of it quickly while we were out for dinner. Ultimately, the apartment didn't get in the way of enjoying the city and we had a little extra money left over to spend elsewhere.","9"
"Great space for me and my significant other. Perfect location, and parking was secure and convenient.","9"
"Ben was a fantastic host and very helpful. My biggest issue about the place: very very loud with very thin walls. Screaming neighbours and dogs barking until early in the morning. Otherwise clean and easy and Ben was great.","9"
"This studio is in a great location! It is perfect for a couple who is visiting and doesn’t plan on spending their entire time inside the studio, but needs a cozy space to check back in, take a break throughout the day, and relax at the end of the day. Ben provided very clear and detailed instructions! I had a lovely time.","9"
"Well, here is a thing, I've gave one star to this entire place and to cleanliness due to issues with bedroom sheets. They do not change it. And the whole bed and sheets had odours of sweat, some body smell and on top of those ""reach"" smells the cover of some deodorant of perfume - it might be used instead of washing the sheets or it might be just additional flowering from the previous dozens of clients. 

So why 1 point? Because this is apparently a ""tradition"" at this place not to change sheets and not to hear the customers - the same issue was already addressed in the comments and here we are at the same point and nothing was done.
Finding it as a real disrespectful attitudes towards the clients, especially when the same issue was already addressed by other people, but the owner still kept the same ""tradition"" not to change the sheets. 
And in addition, same place charged me 49 CAD for cleaning fees when the cost of the place per night was 31 CAD. So it is 61.25% of the whole price for cleaning. I think they could take 3$ for the sheet's washing from those 49CAD, but they didn't.. 
--
*Additional thing to keep in mind, that the apartment is in the centre of Montreal and the windows are not really built with good sound isolation, so you might hear all the sounds of the street even during the night. 

Hope the review will change the attitude of the owner towards his customers .","9"
"Ben A flat was quiet and secure with the Metro near by. The restaurants and bars one block walk away. Parking on site available for cars only with maximum height of 70"". 
We had a great stay and would recommend unit for 2 or 3 people.","9"

I would come back.","9"
"Everything went smoothly from checking in to parking to find the location. The location was right in the heart of downtown Montreal and everything was in walking distance. The Airbnb had a pool, roof top terence, Netflix and parking. Would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Great location, nice to be able to have parking included and have the car at a safe place, especially in the winter, making sure it is not getting towed. 
Functional apartment, we did not check out or used any of the extra amenities, so I cant say much about this. 
But the Apartment was perfect for a nice get away montreal weekend, 
enjoied the jazz club around the corner and all was good, clean and there. 
Thank you","9"
"Nice and spacious apartment- a bit far from metro, but Bixi station was very close and grocery store was within walking distance (5 mins). 
However, upon considering your stay here, bear in mind that they are very serious about their cleaning- you should thoroughly clean (vacuum, mop, bathroom) before giving back the keys to the apartment. I did not and he requested 50$ after my leaving the place (even though I did not agree to this fee when reserving). 
Apart from that, located to many cute restaurants and shops. ","9"
"Superbe appartement bien entretenu dans un excellent quartier à Montréal. Près des commerces du Plateau et du transport en commun.
Philippe et Sandra sont des hôtes très agréables et serviables. Je recommande fortement et je le louerais encore.","9"
"Three friends and I stayed at Philippe and Sandra's lovely apartment for the weekend. We arrived later than expected, but Sandra was very flexible and kind about this. The apartment itself was well equipped except for some small things, which was easily amendable as there is a grocery store just a few blocks away. The hosts were personable and sweet, and left many helpful books and maps to ease our exploration of Montreal. As far as location, we were able to walk all over the Plateau neighborhood easily, full of great restaurants and shops. There was easy access to the subway from the apartment to get to old town, downtown, etc. in just a matter of minutes, though walking was our preferred mode of transportation! Truly a great experience and good value, we would recommend Philippe and Sandra's place to any friend.","9"

Nous reviendrons à coup sûr :-) Je vous recommande fortement cet appartement. ","9"
"This was the first time I used Airbnb. Philippe and Sandra's apartment was very large and amazing. There was lots of natural light in the suite. I loved staying there and the area is full of great coffee shops and resto's . I will stay at this suite again. Thank you Philippe and Sandra.","9"
"Philippe and Sandra are very nice and helpful. They even offered me a bottle of water when I arrived although the grocery store is a couple of blocks away.
The place is as clean as it can be, it has a lot of space and is in one of my favorite areas of Montreal. Neighbors are quiet, and there's all the furniture you need. I recommend it to anyone staying in Montreal.","9"
"Philippe et Sandra se sont avérés des hôtes courtois et disponibles. L'appartement de 2 chambres était propre et comportait tout l'équipement nécessaire pour cuisiner les courses achetées sur la belle rue Laurier à proximité.

"Had a great stay. The place is simple and quiet, but close to metro, an easy walk to shops and restaurants and the fun mile end area. Best way to get around is on bixi's though! The apartment was very clean and had almost everything we would have needed. I arrived very late at night and alone, but was made to feel very safe and comfortable by the hosts. They were adamant that if I needed anything, they were there to help. I would definitely stay again.","9"

It's walking distance from the subway and there's a bus stop right outside. Phillipe and Sandra were very quick to respond to any of our needs. They gave us useful tips about interesting places worth visiting and how to get there. I highly recomend this apartment.","9"
"This place was awesome! Very close to public transportation and the neighborhood was great. Filled with eatery stores and markets. This place made our trip even better.

The neighbourhood is quiet and accommodates all the needs and wants of visitors (grocery, chocolates, wine, fresh baked products, etc), all within walking distance. Thank you for making my second trip to Montreal as lovely as the first. ","9"

We'll definitely consider this place again. ","9"
"The apartment was brilliant! new, clean, comfy and with all the details to feel yourself at home.

"Super expérience dans l'appartement de Philippe et Sandra. 
Avant d'arriver ils étaient disponibles et facilement joignables par mail pour toute information et aide.
Nous étions 4 dans ce logement, il y avait de la place pour tout le monde, l'appartement est donc spacieux, propre et chaleureux. 
Philippe nous a tout expliqué dès notre arrivée (fonctionnement de l'appartement, transport en commun, magasin) et un cahier d’informations est à notre disposition dans le salon.
L'appartement est à 10-15 minutes à pied de la station de métro Laurier qui permet d'aller au centre ville. Des commerces et restaurants sont à proximité.
Je recommande vivement ce logement.

"Philippe was very welcoming and always responsive via airbnb, though because of our personal scheduling we did not meet.  The Apartment was well furnished and had everything we needed during our stay.  The  location is great.  Finding street parking was no trouble.  A wonderful, nicely cultured neighborhood with many great shops, cafes, and restaurants close by, as well as a 10-15 minute walk to the metro.","9"
"The apartment was very clean and Philippe was pleasant to work with. 

I should mention however that the entire apartment smells very strongly of cigarette smoke and we were not given any notice of this (it even permeates the bedding and remained on our clothes for days after leaving). We were informed upon our arrival that this was from recent guests. I certainly understand that this was beyond Philippe's control, but we would have definitely appreciated a heads up beforehand as this would have affected our decision to stay at the apartment. In all other respects, we had a great stay. ","9"
"The neighborhood is pretty cute nestled the Plateau so close to a lot of nearby places. The apartment is up a steep spiral staircase so be careful going up in winter time. We had everything that we needed and Philippe included a folder with a lot of information for you to get around. 

Although bathroom is a little small, but clean. Towels were included and we had no problems staying there. 

Thanks Philippe for everything! ","9"

"Philippe's place is so beautiful! My parents and I stayed for 3 nights and everything was super smooth. The location is great, right in the Plateau area and close to transit and very popular streets. Philippe is super friendly and ready to help or give advice. The apartment is warm, cosy, two nice bedrooms, great kitchen and living area. Very pleased with this experience!","9"
"This place was just as described - fantastic value for a 2 bedroom. I was in town visiting friends and it was perfect for my needs. The neighbourhood is lovely - very close to places I wanted to go in the Plateau/Mile End, etc. Philippe was very friendly to communicate with and responsive to any questions we had. He also provided great directions and the coffee maker was a nice touch. Overall, just what I was looking for. ","9"
"We enjoyed staying in Philippes house, it was the perfect starting point to explore Montreal for the first time: The bus stops right in front of the door, you walk 10 minutes to the metro, and the little shops and cafés on Av. Laurier are only some steps away. We had a friendly and helpful host, and the apartment was perfect for our little family (2 adults, 1 child). Everything was clean and well prepared for our stay.","9"
"The house was great and in walking distance of everything including the 2 train which takes you to downtown. The apartment fits 4 comfortably and is provided with cooking equipment if you need them which I thought was really good. Phillippe and his wife were very good hosts and greeted us the first day my next stay in Montreal I will definitely be staying here again. Supermarket is right around the corner and so is the liquor store.","9"
"Un grand merci à Philippe et Sandra pour leur accueil.

"We arrived late on a Friday night and communicated previously with Philippe through text messaging. He was there to greet us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment. He informed us of all the local shops for any basics and groceries that we might need.  The apartment was simple and everything we needed - a comfortable bed, a good shower, space to relax after walking around all day. There is also a kitchen for those who want to cook. Would happily stay here again. ","9"

"L'accueil personnalisé de Philippe m'a agréablement surpris dans ce sens tout était efficacement arrangé pour mon arrivée. Philippe n'était pas présent à mon arrivée lais l'appartement était accessible par ses bines indications. La visite tôt le lendemain matin pour prendre de mes nouvelles et me proposer le petit déjeuner est la cerise sur le gâteau ! Cela prouve qu'il a à cœur le bien être  de ses clients. Tout est pensé à l'avance pour que vous soyez a l'aise et ce dans les détails. Cela vous permet d'être autonome tout de suite meme si cela devrait être votre première visite à Montréal ! Et j'y retournerai bien volontiers.","9"
"My daughter and I loved Philippe's apartment in Montreal.  The neighborhood was quiet, conveniently located near a strip of restaurants, a grocery store, and drug store.  It was nice having a bus stop right at the bottom of the stairs.  It was super clean and everything we needed was in the apartment.  We'd gladly stay with them again.  ","9"

Nous remercions Sandra pour son accueil et ses explications, nos hôtes ont été très arrangeants. Pour une première visite de Montréal en famille, nous avons passé un excellent séjour. A recommander vivement.","9"
"Nous sommes ravis de notre séjour dans le logement de Philippe et Sandra. Pratique, bien situé, bien équipé, l'appartement était parfait. L'accueil de Philippe et Sandra a été chaleureux et nous avons beaucoup apprécié les échanges avec eux. Un tout petit bémol sur le parking dans la rue qui nous a semblé compliqué...mais il semble que ce soit le cas dans pas mal de rues à Montréal. Encore merci à eux pour leur grande disponibilité.","9"
"My friend and I had just a great experience at Philippe's. The place is cozy and located in a nice neighborhood. Perhaps, my only concern was the absence of a/c, which would be nice to have during the summer    ","9"
"My stay was excellent. The unit was as shown on AirB&B. Philippe was very responsive and the unit was well located. Great Stay!!! I would stay there again.","9"
"We had a great stay at Philippe and Sandra's! The apartment was exactly as described and was ready and waiting for us to drop our bags and settle in when we arrived. The neighbourhood is Montreal at its finest - brick buildings, small shops and cafés, green boulevards and parks, and very walkable. Philippe and Sandra answered all our inquiries promptly and were lovely hosts. We look forward to a chance to stay here again in future!

One thing to note: due to some construction at the Laurier metro station entrance on Laurier Ave. the walk was a couple minutes longer to reach the other Laurier station entrance at Saint-Joseph Blvd. Nothing too much for avid pedestrians like us but it might be for some.

We also definitely recommend getting ice cream at Bo Bec on Laurier Ave! It's about a 5 minute walk from the apartment.","9"
"Un appartement idéalement situé dans un quartier calme et fort sympathique ! 
Nous avons rencontré Sandra qui a été adorable, accessible et de bons conseils. 
Nous recommandons ce logement. ","9"
"This being our first Airbnb experience, my wife and I were very pleased with this clean, comfortable apartment.  The hosts were helpful, and while we never met them in person, everything was well prepared for our arrival and they were very easy to keep in touch with before and during the stay.  All amenities were as promised, bed and bath clean and comfortable, and there was just enough room for us to feel like we could spread out a bit while spending indoor downtime during our vacation.  The neighborhood is pleasant, though prospective guests should know that it is located rather on the far northwest end of the Mont Royal Plateau area (about a mile north of Boulevard St. Laurent).  But there are attractions nearer by as well, so all in all an excellent stay.  Strongly recommended.","9"
"Philippe et Sandra nous ont accueilli avec beaucoup d'entrain, merci à eux pour leur accueil. Un appartement sympathique très bien placé dans un quartier vivant mais restant calme.
Rien à dire, tout a été parfait !!

"Philippe était présent pour nous accueillir même tôt le matin. Il c'est montré très disponible pour toute aide ou conseils. Nous connaissions déjà le quartier donc nous n'avons pas eu de demande particulière mais si la situation le devait nous aurions pu le joindre facilement surtout qu'il réside au rez de chaussée. 
L'appartement est fonctionnel, propre et confortable. ","9"
"Although we didn't interact much with our host, we met him briefly during our stay and he was very welcoming and friendly. The listing was exactly as described. It was a gorgeous little apartment with everything you'd need for a short stay - extra blankets, iron, cutlery, etc. The neighbourhood was also wonderful. I loved Montreal and I loved the apartment we had the wonderful opportunity to stay in. Thank you Phillipe!","9"
"Phillipe's apartment was very clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed for our stay. He was very hospitable. I would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Such an cozy and beautiful home. Every time I come to Montreal now, I plan on staying there!","9"
"Accueil très chaleureux, Philippe et Sandra sont deux hôtes exemplaires, toujours disponibles si on a besoin.
L'appartement est exactement comme sur les photos, très bien agencé, tout est très propre. Il est bien situé, à 10/15 minutes du métro Laurier à pied et en bas de la rue on trouve pleins de commerces, de quoi faire ses courses et des restaurants. 
Nous y sommes restées 2 mois avec une amie et nous nous sentions vraiment chez nous !!
Très bonne adresse n'hésitez surtout pas !!!! :)

"Très bon séjour chez Philippe, l'appartement est propre et calme, très bien situé.","9"
"My brother and I enjoyed our stay at Philippe and Sandra's place. Although I did not meet Philippe (but I did speak with him over the phone (very nice guy)) I did meet Sandra who was very lovely. She gave my brother and I a tour of the place and also made sure that where we were parked for our stay would be a good place to park to avoid parking tickets. Within the house they provided a nice little manual that they drew up. It had a nice map with near by restaurants, grocery stores and public transportation and also instructions on how to use the tv and a listing of some of the more used channels so you didn't have to go searching for them as well as information for connecting to the wifi. There were some basic cooking supplies (pots, cutlery and such) which was nice as that meant that we didn't have to eat out every night. The area was very nice, and just a few minutes walk away from a very nice park, bike rental station and swimming pool and about a 10-15 minute walk to the Metro. From their place to Rue Sherbrooke and St. Laurent (where they had many festivities for the Grand Prix Weekend) cost my brother and I about $11 for the taxi ride. All in all, the place is nice though it is a bit small, especially the bathroom. However, the 2 bedrooms that were there were a good size and didn't feel cramped at all. As mentioned before, our stay there was enjoyable. I would stay there again.","9"
"Malheureusement, nous n'avons pas rencontré Philippe, mais tout était prêt pour notre arrivée malgré notre retard (attente de 3h à la douane). L'appartement correspond bien aux photos. Il se trouve à +-14 minutes du métro Laurier et il y a tout ce qu'il faut à proximité.","9"
"Notre arrivée a été sans surprise mise à part la belle ambiance du quartier et de sa rue centrale toute proche.","9"
"Philippe's place is a great home base while in Montreal. It's in a lovely residential neighborhood. The place was nice, clean and had everything we needed. It's small but enough space for 2-3 people. We had no problem on arrival, just a bit of confusion on the checkout time but it ended up working out. Definitely important to know that the way in is up a VERY steep staircase! I would recommend staying here :)","9"
"Everything was cool, especially because there was small problem Phillipe quickly fixed.  Montreal was a great surprise, now I know where I might run if Trump gets elected ;-)","9"
"It was a very easy communication via email.  We never saw our host, however, it was easy to get in and utilize the apartment. There was a manual on the table describing, however, the first page is only in French.  The place is clean and has all the minimum amenities.  The bathroom, and the shower is very small but the size of the kitchen and the apartment and the bedrooms are good.","9"
"Nous ont renseigner sur le quartier et ses commodités  , piscine ,location de voiture , transport en commun . Quartier très sympathique , parc à côté  , (Website hidden by Airbnb) familiale ","9"
"Non abbiamo mai incontrato Philippe durante la nostra permanenza ma è stato molto gentile, ci ha anche fornito seggiolone e lettino per la bimba piccola ed è stato molto elastico per gli orari di arrivo e partenza. Tutto l'appartamento è molto pulito e, anche se dalle foto sembra più grande di quello che è, resta comunque molto carino, curato e accogliente. La Wi-Fi funziona bene e la posizione è comoda: a 10 minuti dalla metro e in un bel quartiere residenziale.","9"
"We had a pleasant stay in the apartment. The location is very nice, the apartment simple but convenient. 
The communication was good with Philippe.","9"
"This was our first Airbnb stay and it was fabulous! The apartment was exactly as described in the listing and very clean. For us the location was perfect--near our friends and around the corner from a beautiful park, restaurants, and cafes. ","9"
"Pour la deuxième fois tout c'est très bien passé.","9"
"This place was as shown in the images, simple and cute with the basics.  The neighborhood was up and coming with lots of cool restaurant.  Nice vibe about it, felt very safe.  Would recommend for people who want something a little cooler and laid back ","9"
"my friend and i had a great overall experience staying at philippe's airbnb. philipe's wife initially greeted us with her huge smile and warm personality.  the place itself was super clean and perfect for 2-3 people. amenities wise the place isn't as stocked as others i've been but that's probably because i've been spoiled at others so make sure you bring shampoo, soap, extra coffee and tea. philippe is very quick at responding whenever you message him, he also lives downstairs so if you need anything just ring. to those driving there is street parking but its a bit confusing, make sure you read the signs like normal and you'll be fine. what else? thats about it! cool, chill spot, neat shops around, perfect base camp. ","9"
"All as described. Friendly and helpful host.","9"
"Très propre, coin tranquille, livret d'instruction informatif ( resto, pharmacie, metro etc).","9"
"We had a lovely stay at the cosy apartment and were really thankful for the recommendation and help from Philippe and his wife. The apartment is situated on the first floor, reachable by a typical Montreal stairway. We stayed with 2 Persons in the apartment which was perfect. The place was clean and well equipped. Everything you need is provided and looked like on the pictures. The bathroom is small but didn't bothered us.   
The public transportation is near by, the Metro is in walking distance about 12 min,the bus right in front of the house. Also a bakery, supermarket and pharmacy are close by. We felt like home living in a typical Montreal apartment situated in a nice environment.  ","9"
"Appartement dans un quartier calme et sympathique. Le propriétaire est efficace et accommodant.","9"

"L'appartement de Philippe est situé dans le pittoresque quartier du Plateau Mont-Royal où se trouvent toutes les maisons avec leurs escaliers extérieurs, typiques de Montréal. Il est bien équipé et agréable, facile d'accès depuis la station de métro Laurier (15 minutes de marche) ou par bus (un arrêt devant la maison). On accède facilement et rapidement au centre-ville et au Mont-Royal. Il aussi est tout proche d'une rue commerçante et d'un supermarché Metro bien pratique.

"Great location! Many restaurants at walking distance! Parking was a little tricky, but we got lucky!","9"
"Our long weekend stay was great! There were good places to eat right down the street, and plenty of other good things to do a short Uber ride away. My only issue was that the wifi was really slow and inconsistent. I keep just using my phone data in order to access maps and stuff to plan our outings. If I had had work to do and was relying on the wifi to send emails with attachments, it would have been very frustrating. Also, the bathroom is very small - there is almost no leg room in from of the toilet. Aside from those two things though, everything was great. I was nervous about finding street parking, but we always managed to find a decent spot.","9"

"Great location, very spacious, bright kitchen - had everything we needed for a comfortable 5 nights in Montreal.","9"
"Nice and Clean place . With all basic amenities.","9"
"We had a good stay at Philippe’s apartment. It’s basic, but it has everything you need and is great value for the price. We really appreciated the self-check in and key code lock, which made our arrival and departure really easy and we didn’t have to worry about trying to coordinate around specific times. It was also great not to have to worry about carrying around keys! The apartment is within walking distance (right down the block) to a grocery store, liquor store, pharmacy as well as some restaurants and coffee shops and is also not a far walk to more options on Avenue du Mont-Royal. There is a bus stop right at the corner beside the apartment, but it is a bit longer of a walk to the metro (around 15 minutes). Just a note that the bed is a little on the firmer side, but that might just personal preference. Apartment comes with all the basics you’ll need. Philippe was easy to communicate with and very responsive. Great spot for a home base in Montreal!","9"
"L’appartement est silencieuse & est très bien situé pour l’autobus et métro. Beaucoup de restaurants a proximité.
Communication rapide avec Philippe!

J’y retournerai certainement à ma prochaine visite à Montréal !","9"
"The place was as expected in the pictures , you could  say a little better even in real . The host , was really nice and flexible with the arriving time since I got late .

The price was really fair, especially for the quality of the furnishings. Steven was very accommodating and was a great help at check in.  Thanks again Steven. ","9"
"This was the first time we booked on Airbnb and it was a wonderful experience. Steven was very prompt in answering our questions and was also very welcoming.  We had no difficulty finding this apartment as it was near to the Cadillac metro station. It was very clean and everything inside has been remodeled so had a feeling of luxury.  It had everything we needed from towels to kitchenware and refrigerator and microwave and toaster.  The TV was right in front of the bed and was filled with Netflix and other apps so you can choose movies or TV shows from a large variety of choices. The apartment was about 2 blocks from the metro so it was very convenient to get to downtown, maybe in about 8 minutes. 

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Montreal!","9"
"Great place, close to central montreal. Thank you Steven! Would def recommend!  ","9"
"Our place was tidy and cozy. There was everything a traveler would need, including all the utilities needed to cook and clean with, as well as extra towels and bathroom amenities. Our neighbors upstairs were a little noisy (you can hear their footsteps), as they had a small child or perhaps several who would run around in the mornings as well as late in the night. When their doorbell rings, the lights inside the apartment will flash, and an alarm will sound. It is in a basement, but the location is fantastic. There was a nice park across the street, and it was only a few hundred meters from the subway, which will take you into the city in less than a half hour. Unfortunately, we did lose our key, and had to pay the most expensive option to regulate the situation. If this happens to you, purchase a Weiser SmartKey Relocking set at Walmart or Home Depot, a few kilometers away from the apartment for $15 to re-key it yourself, as the lock is a Weiser Smartkey lock, which does not need to be replaced to be re-keyed. With that said, be advised that since there is no security deposit, any potential damages will have to be discussed between you and your host. Other than losing our key and having to replace an entire lock rather than getting a new set of keys, we had a great time in Montreal and enjoyed our stay in Steven's lodging.","9"
"Prima kamer op een goede locatie!","9"
"A great experience! This was our first time visiting Montreal and the location of this apartment worked out very well. What a great value! It took us about 7 minutes or so to walk to the Metro in the morning which was incredibly easy to use. The area where the apartment is located is quiet and residential. The apartment was clean and felt brand new. Steven was very helpful and easy to communicate with. Easy and straightforward check-in and check-out. If (when) we're back in Montreal, we'll certainly book again! ","9"
"Logement agréable, Propre je dirais entièrement rénové avec possibilité de ce garer pas loin.
A environs 300 m à pied du metro, 20 m à pied d'un parc, 2 km environs du parc olympique.
Propriétaire sympas et explicite.
Un grand merci !
On recommande.","9"

"Super clean, though small, apartment with easy parking (except monday afternoons!) and easy access to rentable bikes (10 minute ride to botanical gardens, 5 minutes to biodome. Attn: when you rent the bikes, you'll be charged extra for trips over 30 minutes). 
About 20 minute drive to downtown Montreal. Not a great food scene nearby, so expect to drive or bike your way to something. 
Apartment itself is fine-- a bit warm in the summer-- bed isn't super comfortable, but that was our only complaint.  Super clean, newly renovated, quiet area. Great value!","9"
"Excellente expérience! Appartement conforme aux photos, bien équipé et très bien propre, proche du métro Cadillac. Proche supermarchés et quelques restaurants aussi. 
Steven n'a pas pu nous recevoir à notre arrivée, mais il a laissé son voisin s'en charger et nous avons été très bien accueillis. 
Excellent rapport qualité/prix.
Si nous retournons à Montréal, nous irons sans hésiter chez Steven.

"Steven is a great host. His place was very clean, organized and tidy. The place was also near subway station which made transportation easier.","9"
"Batchelor très accessible très propre , soigné je recommande sans hésiter hôte très réceptif a nos demande.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","8"
"Great location. The apartment was a little messy and dusty. The walls are very thin so we had problems sleeping because of the noise from the neighbors, besides the apartment being very hot (the fan wasn’t enough). Yet, there weren’t enough towels for the four of us (the ones we had were dirty and had a bad smell).","8"
"Appartement très bien situé à quelques mns à pied du vieux port, du Vieux Montréal et de toutes les commodités (restaurants, épicerie, station essence, laverie automatique...). Le parc du mont Royal est également accessible à pied pour ceux qui aiment marcher (nous l’avons fait avec 2 enfants de 5 et 8 ans sans soucis), tout comme l’île ST Hélène par le métro (10 mns de l’appart).
Stationnement aisé dans le quartier, il faut juste faire attention aux différents panneaux car il y a des jours et des heures de stationnement spécifiques pour chaque zone.
Immeuble cependant un peux ancien avec un escalier extérieur légèrement dangereux si on a des enfants.","8"
"Great location. Lovely house. Bigger than it looks in the pictures. Dog friendly. Would definitely recommend it.","10"
" Gorgeous home even better in person. The private parking spot is tight as we rented a van. Street parking is annoying as there's restrictions. We got two parking tickets! 
Great city with lots of parks, bakeries, markets and restaurants. Short walk to subway. Can't wait to visit again","10"
"Cette maison a beaucoup de charme. Idéalement située, elle permet de profiter des attraits du plateau tout en étant très au calme.","10"
"While Jean-Francois was out of the country during our stay, he had gone out of his way to make our experience a pleasure. This included lots of information and personal suggestions for dining and sight seeing as well as an excellent customer service including his friend who welcomed us upon our arrival. 
The appartement was very beautiful, comfortable and welcoming! We were on our business trip and this appartement, with a terrace and a charming small garden, made us feel like on holidays after long days of work. We would definitely recommend staying here!
","10"
"Appartements extraordinaire. Bien situé. ( Restaurant, bar, piste cyclable) 
Parking sur place. ","10"
"We loved Jean-François's place. It was comfortable and close to everything. However, there was construction that started really early in the morning, around 7am in the morning! The construction noice woke us up and unfortunately was disruptive. Apart from the construction noise, the house was great and felt like home.","10"
"Jean-François' place was delightful. It is a beautiful, two level home in charming neighborhood if Montreal. The home is clean, comfortable, and well furnished. 
The off street parking is tight. We were renting a Nissan Rouge, and it fit, but I don't think a larger vehicle would fit. This was fine because once we parked, we walked everywhere and the vehicle didn't move. 
We had a great stay and are already talking about coming back. ","10"
"Its a beautiful house. Lovingly decorated. Jean-Francois was easy to get ahold of and kept in touch with us. Great location with easy walk to bars, restaurants, and shops.","10"
"Loved everything about this place, from the high ceilings, great kitchen, backyard patio, abundance of rooms to relax and recharge, this place was everything I hoped for. Central to most of Montreal, there is no trouble finding what you need from markets, coffee, parks, nightlife, and everything in between. I truly enjoyed my stay here.","10"
"Jean-Francois out of town during our stay but provided tons of information and recommendations for our weekend in advance and we had no problem checking in late on our first night. This house is incredibly beautiful and spacious! There is so much to love - the art, the library upstairs, the kitchen, patio and garden which we got to take advantage of with the fantastic weather during our stay. There was tons of room for our group of 3 couples to enjoy and recharge after wedding festivities for our friends downtown. Anything you need is walking distance. Would highly recommend this place and would consider staying here again with my friends!","10"
"Great location in Mont Royal neighborhood and 5 min walk to Metro which we used every day.  Lots of restaurants nearby and coffee shop directly across the street. The house has excellent air conditioning and the TV is large and new.  The beds were comfortable. There is  a lovely patio out back where we ate a couple of times. There is a pretty park a short walk away.","10"
"Cool place. Close to the mountain and great food. No dryer, but the laundromat is fairly close. Ubers and traffic were definitely an issue from this location (One way), but it was a minor hindrance in what was a pretty good stay.","9"
"My friends and I booked Mano's place for a place to stay for a bachelor party. It was great. Perfect for a group of 6-8 guys looking to share one area to hang out with. Considering the building was old, I was very surprised at how well insulated the sound was. We rarely heard neighbours, if at all. I'd say the only tiny issue is the place is a little old. It's not ritzy, but it's a great place to stay for a group of friends. ","9"
"The apartment is in a really incredible location, walkable to all the cool bars, restaurants and shops in trendy Mile End. The rooms and beds are big, and it is great value for money if you need a place for a bunch of people to stay.","9"
"Our group of 5 rented Mano's place in Montreal for a long weekend bachelor party. The house had 6 separate bedrooms and was in a convenient location so it worked great for our purposes. 

The location is great, with many bars/restaurants close by. There is also a bike share station down the block and a 10 minute walk from the nearest metro. Overall it was a great centralized location to see a lot of the city. ","9"
"Our stay at Mano's place was very good, easy and comfortable . Mano awnser very quickly and was very nice to accommodate to our needs. The appartment is a bit old, so you can hear the wodden floor squeak, but everything else  is set up for guests to enjoy their stay.  The apartment is huge! We are a family of six and we had space to spare! The furniture was different from that shown in the pictures, but other than that it was just as described. The neighborhood seem safe. We had a few walks at night to a 24 hrs grocery store just 2 blocks away and that was very convenient. Overall we had a great time. We would definitively stay there again! Thanks Mano!","9"
"Thank you very much for the positive stay! =D","10"
"Awesome experience! Highly recommended!","10"
"Janie was very helpful with check in and any questions we had. The place was clean and well kept.","10"
"C'est un endroit tranquille, propre et confortable , le studio est bien aménagé avec tout le nécessaire merci!","10"
"What a pleasure to stay at her place!!","10"
"Comfortable, cosy and exactly as described. 5 min to the subway in a quiet but interesting neighbourhood with typical Haitian and Thai restaurants. Janie is on the ball. Totally recommend!","10"
"Space is very cozy, comfortable, and super clean. It is very close to public transit so travelling around was easy. Janie was also very attentive and helpful. Would most definitely come back again!","10"
"If you're looking for a clean and private place to stay in a beautiful neighbourhood this is definitely where you want to go. We found Janie to be very kind and personable I would highly recommend booking with her.","10"
"Le logement était très propre et fonctionnel.Le quartier était calme et le métro proche.Janie était facilement joignable pour répondre à toutes nos questions.","10"
"Rien à redire ! 
Notre séjour dans le studio de Janie a été très agréable","10"
"L'appartement était conforme à la description. La communication était parfaite avec la propriétaire. Je n'ai rien à redire. Je recommande!","10"
"Super studio, bien équipé et propre.
Janie répond très vite et est très sympathique.","10"
"I loved that the keys were in a numbered locked box because i felt no pressure about when i could check in. The studio, beddings and washroom were very clean, it was quiet and peaceful. I did not meet Janie personnally and it was fine as i was looking for rest. However, Janie was very quick to respond to any message and overall i m giving a 10/10 to Janie and her studio because my expectations were met 100% from what i read and viewed on the application. I recommend this studio and will surely go there again if it is available. Thank you Janie.","10"
"Great stay at Janie's apartment. Janie was an excellent host, very easy to communicate with and checked to make sure we got settled in ok etc. Apartment is cosy and clean, has all you need for a short stay. Bit farther from some of the busier areas in Montreal but very close to a Bixi bike station and 10 mins to metro station which is handy. Overall a good stay, would recommend and very good value!","10"
"Hébergement conforme à sa description et à nos attentes. Hébergement très confortable et équipements en très bon état et Confort.  Excellente communication avec Janie. Un 10 min. à pied pour se rendre à la station de Métro n'est pas désagréable dans la rue aux grands arbres. Parfait pour notre Week-end à Montréal.","10"
"This was our first time checking out Montreal which is a beautiful city! Janie helped us out a lot. She responded quickly to my questions and she made check-in pretty easy. She was nice enough to have us check-out later than 10 a.m. Which gave us more time to have a latte at Crew Collective & Cafe in Old Montreal. 

Janie's place is beautiful, clean, and cozy. The neighborhood is quiet and everyone is welcoming. Her place is a little far from everything else but she is 10 minutes away from the Metro which made it easier for us to get to downtown Montreal. On the bright side you get to explore the beautiful scenery!!!! 

Thank you for everything Janie! Highly recommended!!!","10"
"Petit studio très bien amménagé et d'une propreté impeccable. Recommandé pour quiconque recherche une valeur sûre à Montréal.","10"
"Nice apartment! You can hear the neighbors upstairs but other than that the place was nice and homie. Perfect for a short stay!","10"
"Janie’s place was exactly how it looked in the pictures. It was a perfect space. Not too big not too small just right. She was very quick to answer to any questions I had. I will definitely book at her place again. Loved the fact that I booked a night before and everything was to par. I recommend staying here for anyone looking for a very cozy and quiet place to stay.","10"
"Clean, quiet and close to the city. Enjoyable stay.","10"
"c est un petit studio vraiment très bien, propre, facilité de stationnement.","10"
"Le logement est en demi-sous-sol et a donc un côté très douillet bien appréciable pendant l'hiver aussi - même pendant la vague de froid du Noël 2017!! Très bon rapport qualité-prix - Facile d'accès depuis le métro Jean Talon et le centre ville est donc bien accessible aussi. Des dépanneurs pas loin. N'hésitez pas!","10"
"I loved the location. Everything in Montreal is very far a part so even though it’s 15 min from downtown by car it takes a long time to walk anywhere. We went during January so the heating was awesome and we kept warm with the blankets provided for us on the bed. Some things to expect: there are some pipe issues, so one line of water shoots off in another direction when using the sinks and the shower. Also, the space is much smaller than I expected but it felt good for two people. Other than that it was a very clean, convenient, and open space.","10"
"Studio bien aménagé et efficace, bien situé et facilité pour stationner son véhicule Cartier tranquille . nous avons beaucoup apprécié.","10"
"Great host, Perfect location the neighbourhood is quiet with almost anything you need within walking distance and access to public transit. 10/10 would recommend and would stay again when in Montreal.","10"
"Quartier tranquille,","10"
"Loved Janie’s place! Her apartment was very clean and well stocked. Check-in was easy and the location was great. Would definitely recommend to others!","10"
"We had a lovely stay at Janie's place. The apartment is well located, with easy access to public transport. Check-in was simple, and flexible-- which we really appreciated. The apartment is exactly as described, and is a really nice space to spend the weekend. Communication with Janie was great. We really enjoyed our stay.","10"
"Beau petit logement très chaleureux qui nous donne l'impression d'être à la maison. Le quartier est tranquille et même si les transports ne sont pas super prêts, la route pour se rendre se fait très bien. Tout le séjour s'est fait naturellement. Merci à l'hôte pour les instructions très claires. Je recommande sans hésiter !","10"
"Emplacement très propre, communication facile et efficace. Tout le nécessaire est à disposition. Je recommande!","10"
"À recommander!","10"
"Janie was a friendly and communicable host and I had an easy, comfortable stay. Good space for one person or a couple. If you’re used to set-up-for-purpose AirBnBs, keep in mind that someone lives here when it’s not rented out. Villeray is a nice quiet neighbourhood and apart from upstairs neighbors walking around you don’t get any noise, it’s peaceful and quiet. Close to Metro stops, although I walked into town a couple of times... Montreal is not that big anyway!","10"
"Nós amamos a estadia e o ambiente, o apartamento fica perto do metro e do sistema de uso de bicicleta, perto de comercio e parques. Janie é ráoida nas respostas e muito solicita.

Agradecemos por tudo.","10"
"This was my second time staying at Janie's place. Amazing as always! Great host, and amazing place! Definitely recommend.","10"
"Studio sympa, propre et fonctionel; check in tres facile meme en arrivant apres 22h. Merci!","10"
"Super studio parfait pour visiter Montréal et se reposer après une journée de marche sous la chaleur.
En effet l'appartement est bien frais.","10"
"It is a cozy basement apartment that has almost everything you might need but it could be cleaner regarding towels and dust. It is sad to mention that I didn't feel very welcome there as during my 3 nights stay I was reminded twice to check out before 10 am as there are other visitors arriving right after us. For the wifi connection you would have to use a little bit of logic as the details provided are not quite right. Overall a nice place for this price.","10"
"We enjoyed staying at Janie's place. Is a small basement apartment. The metro is walking distance and parking was easy. Recommend. .","10"
"It was a pleasure.","10"
"Very quiet, safe, and friendly neighborhood.  Apartment was well equipped and neat. Would definitely recommend to friends.","10"
"Janie's place is wonderful. This place is cleaned and independent. Also, it's easy check in. This place will always my choice any time I plan to travel to Montreal. I highly recommend Janie's place because it's near to everything. it's located in a safe area.","10"
"Appartement propre et calme. 
Janie  est très réactive à nos demandes. 
Métro pas loin. 
","10"
"Merci beaucoup ! Très pratique pour mes parents qui ont pu rester à seulement quelques mètres de notre appartement sur l'avenue des Érables. Ils ont été satisfait de l'expérience et tout a bien été. Nous le louerons sûrement à nouveau lors de leur prochaine visite.","10"
"Very nice place close to bus/metro station. Really recommended, thanks a lot for the hospitality !","10"
"Janie’s place was great for my girlfriend and I.  We brought bikes with us to Montréal so it was super easy for us to get around the city and to see all the sights!  Janie’s place was in a great location for us since we could bike right into the city with no hassle.  The place was perfect to come home to and relax in bed while watching some television after a long day of sight seeing and bike riding.  Janie was easy to reach and always responded quickly!","10"
"Merci beaucoup","10"
"The place is super clean and cozy. I totally recommend for couples or students that need some quiet place after classes.  A bit far from the center if you don't have a car (12-15min). By metro it takes 30 - 40 minutes to get there. It worthed for me. The neighbourhood is very quiet.","10"
"Good place .good value . Small but nice . Great for our short stay. Thanks","10"
"Highly recommend it! It is a lil outside of the downtown area, but it is worth it!","10"
"L'appartement est propre, proche du transport public, facile d'arriver. Nous avons profité au maximum le lieux. Pas bruit et un excellent hospitalité!","10"
"Janie was a great host. She was quick to respond and friendly. The studio apartment was clean, cozy and just like how it looks in the pictures. Location was a 20m drive / 40m by bus/metro to downtown. Looking forward to many more stays.","10"
"Janie’s place is five out of five! It’s very clean and cozy. Easy access to public transits as well. No need to say Janie has been super helpful, she offers very clear instructions about how to check in and check out. Thank you for hosting.","10"
"Gabriel's place was perfect for the few days my husband and I spent in Montreal -- it's a great size and in a perfect location!  He was great at communicating with me before we arrived so that check in was a breeze -- he also made sure we had two lattes waiting for us at the nearby coffee shop!  We would definitely stay there again.","9"
"It was a pleasant stay and the apartment was spacious and comfortable.  There are many shops and good restaurants around the neighborhood!  Gabriel is a great host.","9"
"Gabriel’s apartment was fantastic! We were pleasantly surprised by the front and back terrace both with seating! The queen bed was very comfortable! The apartment was clean and easy to access. It is steps from Saint Laurent  and 5 minute walk to Mont Royal station. So much good food and amazing coffee around the corner. Had an almond milk flat white every morning at Paquebot!!! There is a park around the corner and a grocery store at the end of the street. Even though there wasn’t air conditioning the apartment was quiet cool being on the bottom level. Although it was still very bright with the sliding doors!! Gabriel was quick to respond and checkin and checkout was very smooth and easy!! I highly recommend staying at Gabriel’s!!","9"
"This is, indeed, a magnificent place, especially (for me) the balcony - which is the size of three or four normal balconies in other cities. You can enjoy the full sun on it in the morning and have shade by afternoon. Luc and Constance clearly love their place and keep it well. If you are the type who wants every last technological comfort this may not be for you, but if you don't mind living without, say, a microwave or can deal with a bit of difficulty getting in and out of an older bathtub, and you love lovely spaces - this is for you! (that said there is a still a large tv screen and cable which you don't get everywhere). Downstairs, Jean, the owner is also very welcoming and accommodating should you need anything.","9"
"Great place, great host, great location - highly recommend!","9"
"Great place; it really makes you wish you could just take over Luc’s lease and stay here permanently. The main feature of this apartment is the great balcony in the back. We stayed here 3 weeks. Living in his neighbourhood and this apartment in the summer, you are really living the best Montreal life possible.","9"
"Good location, wonderful balcony with many flowers. We were with two kids and balcony was a very good option for all of us while we were there since our kids like to be outside. The place has almost everything you might need at your own home except A/C. You need to climb stairs. But it's only for one floor. We didn't have any problem using it. The floor is wooden so it's a little bit creaky. Overall very good place to stay. Thank you Luc for being a great host.","9"
"A veryyy nice place to reserve 
I have no doubt on recommending this wonderful private room
The host really made me feel at home !

Very spacious room with balcony 
Every thing is well organized and tidy and super clean 

And dealing with the host she is a kind person , well organized and helpful , she provides u at the morning a very nice & healthy breakfast 
You can share some area with her and get a chance to see one of her great movies
Her house is near to a lot of places and to the metro station and also to the bus stop



","10"

"Ioni is an excellent host. She was extremely kind and very accommodating.  The apartment is very clean and the bedroom very large and comfortable. I highly recommend recommend her place.","10"
"Good location, easy approach, and smooth check-in. She was available on phone when needed. Room and apartment was clean and host was caring.","10"
"I had to come back again to Ioni's private room after staying in 2 other houses , what makes it special the room is spacious with a desk and chair to study or finish up your work 
And again , everything in Ioni's house is tidy and clean .
A Lovely stay in her private room while I was in Montreal..

Highly recommended !","10"
"Idéalement situé près du métro et des plusieurs commodités. Très pratique quand on débarque sur Montréal. Séjour vraiment agréable, grande chambre confortable et une hôte au top! Très bon rapport qualité prix, je recommande sans hésitez :) ","10"
"Excellent accueil, Ioni est très sympathique, discrète tout en étant à l'écoute. J'ai passé un excellent séjour et recommande vivement ce choix, très bon rapport qualité / prix. Appartement vaste très soigné et décoré avec simplicité et gout... ","10"
"Ioni was such a great host !
So friendly, her apartment was cozy, the room too.
She left me something for breakfast every morning before she left for work ! So nice of her.
I highly recommend her place.
If you want to go Downtown on foot it will take you about 1 hour and a half which is great because the neighborhood is very nice but don't worry if you don't want to you have a metro station very close to her apartment!","10"
"Ioni was an excellent host. We arrived late and she was totally fine about it. She was so kind!! During our stay she woke up before us just to make us coffee and to leave some nice muffins and bread for our breakfast. All this on a weekend... She could be sleeping, but no, she took really good care of us!
Also, we must mention that the house and room were spotless!   would love to stay again when we return to Montreal!","10"
"Great host, Thanks. ","10"
"The place is very clean, Ioni is a very nice host although she is rarely at home, but knows how to take care of her guests. ","10"
"Ioni was a great host! We felt very comfortable there, wi-fi worked well and it was easy to communicate with her when we needed to. Great access to the metro and city buses. The place was clean and safe, and she left us some breakfast in the mornings, which was super helpful to get our day started. Would definitely go back again next time.","10"
"Ioni is an amazing host. The apartment is really pretty and close to public transportation, the neighborhood is also very quiet and lovely. She is a very kind person and she's also super fun. The place is charming and confortable, also Ioni provides you of everything you need. Definitely I would stay with her again!","10"
"beau logement propre avec une hôte sympathique et tranquille,  calme comme endroit,  rien de négatif a mentionner.","10"
"The place is at a fantastic location (i.e. for grocery-shopping and metros) and Ioni was a fantastic and understanding hostess. She made my stay very enjoyable and she was always happy to help or offer ways to make my stay better!","10"

"Première semaine parfaite dans cette chambre conforme à la descritpion, pour une arrivée PVT en douceur !","10"
"The place was exactly as listed. In a very safe neighborhood, close to the Metro, and parking was no problem. Highly recommend if you are looking to explore Montreal.","10"
"Fantastic location only minutes away from the metro so easy to get to the downtown area and explore Montreal. Room is very large, exactly as advertised and just what I was looking for! Thanks Ioni.","10"
"This is my second time staying with Ioni, so I obviously had a great first-time experience with her! I had a fantastic time staying with her for the second time as well. The room is spacious, the place is clean, and Ioni was pro-active in making sure I was comfortable. The location is also terrific, with two metros and a grocery store nearby!","10"
"Ioni is an amazing host, I strongly recommend her and her apartment to everyone looking for a beautiful, safe, conveniently located, and private room in Montreal. Ioni was always fast on replying to my questions, she accommodated to my arrival and departure, left treats in the morning for me, and was always available with useful tips about getting settled in Montreal. Her apartment is very nice, beautifully decorated, the kitchen is fully equipped, and the room is really cute, big, and private. The location is a real plus, about 1 block or so from a metro station and walking distance to Cote-des-Neiges where you can find everything. The biggest plus is Ioni's personality, she is really easy going, very respectful of giving her guests their own private space, so responsive to the guest's needs and questions, great positive energy to have in a host!","10"
"Ioni is very warm-hearted, she offered breakfast. And the location is also good. But the floor is creaky, so you would hear clearly when someone walks upstairs.","10"
"This was my first stop in the city of Montreal, and Ioni's hospitality really made me feel at home. Her place was clean and had everything you'd need for a great stay. Ioni was also very thoughtful and left snacks and little notes on the table in the mornings. She also gave me advice on navigating through Montréal, finding a good mobile network plan, etc. She was really easy going and it was a pleasure sharing the house with her.","10"
"Le séjour était parfait ! Rien à redire, je recommande sans hésiter :)","10"
"Great host!
Everything very clean
Very good 
Thanks so much","10"
"Great value, awesome location and an amazing host","10"
"Ioni is a lovely host who makes effort to ensure her guests feel at ease. The room is large and kept clean, and has all the amenities needed to make a stay comfortable. The apartment is only 5 mins to the nearest Metro station and then approx. 20 mins into the centre of Montreal. I felt safe in the neighbourhood at all times.","10"
"A great stay. Ioni is respectful and very, very kind. One of those people who are chill in the best possible way. Let's you enjoy your visit, but at the same time she's always open to questions. Easy to get in touch with, so there was no problem with checking in. 

So, thank you for allowing me to stay in your home and for letting me drink all that green tea.^.^","10"

"Arrivé dans le cadre d'un PVT, très confortable et calme pour une première sur Montréal.
J'ai passé un très bon séjour.","10"
"Ioni es una chica muy linda, amable y súper atenta, nos dejaba detallitos de desayuno, es una chica muy muy linda siempre dispuesta a resolver tus dudas y ayudarte en lo que necesites, respeta tu espacio y te hace sentir en casa ! 
El lugar es un departamento muy limpio y cálido, de verdad te sientes en casa, tiene todo lo que puedas necesitar para cocinar; siempre te provee de toallas limpias, sábanas cuando lo necesitas, la ubicación es muy buena, está a 5 min del metro, del súper y llegas en 15 min al centro ! 
Realmente recomendable ! :) ","10"
"A very nice place with a nice host","10"
"Hôte facilitante et sympathique. La proximité avec la ligne orange du métro est un atout non négligeable pour une premiere découverte de montreal.","10"
"Appartement au top, grand, super bien équipé, joliment décoré. Ioni est une super hôte aussi avec un accueil exceptionnel malgré mon arrivé tardive. En plus le logement est à 5min à pied du métro qui lui même est proche du centre. Vraiment un logement à recommander !","10"
"Ioni's place is great; a lovely character building with high ceilings and lots of space. Ioni is a very welcoming host, and it was great to have use of the kitchen to cook! The place is close to the metro and buses, and I found it relatively easy to park in the surrounding area. Also close to a lovely little park and a theatre!","10"
"J'ai passé une très bonne semaine chez Ioni. L'appartement était chaleureux (même avec les -20°C extérieur), parfait pour une première semaine pour s'installer à Montréal, proche du métro, etc. Je recommande !","10"
"Un appartement chaleureux et très bien équipé, très propres, un environnement calme est à deux pas d'un petit centre commerciale, extrêmement pratique. A 5 minutes du métro à pied, et à une station du marché de Jean Talon. Catherine et Sébastien m'ont très bien accueilli, et étaient à disposition pour m'aider en tous temps. 3 semaines à Montréal, qui ce sont déroulées dans la bonne humeur, et dans la découverte d'une ville génial, ainsi que de ses habitants. Je vous conseille une escale chez Catherine pour tous les futurs visiteurs de Montréal.","10"
"Nous avons passé une très bonne semaine de Noël dans l'appartement de Catherine et Sébastien. Très chaleureux et accueillants, ils ont tout fait pour que notre séjour se passe au mieux, se souciant régulièrement de notre bien être et de nos attentes. Avec un supermarché à 2 minutes à pied et le métro à 400 mètres, ce logement est très bien situé (très joli quartier aux maisons en brique et escaliers sur la façade, beaucoup de charme!), agréable à vivre et décoré avec goût. Il ne manquait rien, et nous avons été touché des gentilles attentions de nos hôtes. Je recommande cette location aux futurs visiteurs de Montréal, que du bonheur!!","10"
"Fantastic stay in Montreal with Catherine and her husband.
Apartment was lovely, and the neighbourhood suited us perfectly. Jean-Talon market within walking distance, filled with fresh foods. Great wine store nearby. All kinds of good restaurants including some of the best El Salvadoran food I've ever eaten.
Hosts were fantastic, invited us down for a lovely evening of wine and cheese, but otherwise left us alone...except when we needed something or had a question.
It is well located, with two metro lines and buses nearby. As we are mostly walking people, we loved the location in the very heart of the island. Very nice neighbourhood.
My wife and I would happily stay there again and look forward to our next visit.","10"
"Minha experiencia foi gratificante, a moradia e exatamente como nas fotos, estava limpa e inteiramente equipada. A Catherine e uma otima anfitria. Recomendo a moradia para aqueles que pretendem passar uma temporada em Montreal.","10"
"The flat is very clean and beautifully/simply organized, with all basic accessories you need for an extended stay, including the kitchen and bathroom. The neighborhood is quiet, but close to a lot of great restaurants, and walking distance to many wonderful parts of the city. The hosts were very kind and accommodating, I would highly recommend staying here. ","10"
"Merci à Catherine & Sebastian pour ce séjour. L'appartement est superbe et très propre dans un quartier sympathique, mais sur une rue très calme. Proche du métro & commerces. On peut aller au marché Jean Talons à pied environ 20 minutes de marche agréable. On a beaucoup apprécié les petits détails & les petites attentions. On recommande cette appartement pour un cour & un long séjour à Montréal. ","10"
"Catherine et son mari sont des hôtes charmants, l appartement est très bien agence et joliment décoré rien ne manque. Je recommande fortement ces hôtes.","10"
"Catherine et Sébastien ont été très accueillants. Appartement chaleureux, très bien situé, à proximité de tout. Studio joliment aménagé, efficace et décoré avec soin... Rien d'inutile et tout est là, literie, savon, champoing, etc.

"Catherin and Sebastian were absolutely wonderful.  Catherine kept in close touch with me and was patient enough to answer all my pre-travel questions.  They greeted us at the door on the day of our arrival and gave us some very valuable information about getting around town and where we could find the best gelato :). We were so relaxed here that I was able to read 5 books during our 9-day stay!  My parents are considering coming up next June for the F1 race also and I will certainly be hooking them up with Catherine and Sebastian.","10"

"Chère Catherine;
Nous avons passé de très bonnes vacances, votre accueil était très chaleureux ça nous a donné l'impression que nous vous connaissions depuis longtemps. Nous étions comme à la maison et nous avons pu admirer un pays extraordinaire qui mérite d'être visité plusieurs fois afin de découvrir une bonne partie de sa grande richesse.
Merci encore une fois pour votre accueil, l'appartement est un vrai nid douillé 
nous vous disons à la prochaine et restez comme vous êtes ne changez rien

"Séjour très agréable dans un appartement spacieux et propre. L'accueil et la communication avec Fanny se sont très bien passés. L'emplacement est le gros plus de ce logement, la quartier est très pittoresque et proche des transports.
Seul bémol pour le lit qui n'est pas très confortable.

"I had a very pleasant stay at Fanny's place.  She responded quickly, was there to greet me upon arrival and provided a spotless room in her flat.
The area is packed with interesting places and everything is walkable. 
There is a steep flight of stairs out front- need to exercise caution.  In summertime, look for a brand new deck in the back that is very peaceful and quiet for relaxing moments. And Fanny is a good host. 
I would not hesitate recommending Fanny's place to anyone looking for a pleasant Airbnb experience!","10"

"Fanny’s apartment was great—lots of light, very clean and bright, with a really gorgeous deck. Located in a very cool part of town, filled with lots of great bars and restaurants, with easy access to buses and trains going to other parts of the city. Fanny was a lovely host, giving us tips for what to do nearby and over our weekend stay, and even helping us very promptly when we stupidly got ourselves locked out of the apartment.","10"
"Staying with Fanny was one of the best AirBnB experiences we had in a long time. We stayed with her for 5 nights and wished that we could stay even longer! The whole apartement was very authentic, cozy and clean with a nice big patio. We loved the neighbourhood Mile End, it's close to the Park Mont-Royal and Metro Laurier, nice cafés, restaurants and Bagel shops :)  Fanny was a very nice and helpful and friendly host. She gave us very good recommendations and we felt very welcomed from the first minute! We definitely recommend staying with her! Merci beaucoup! :)  Sara & Max","10"

"Fanny is great with communication and very helpful with everything- she goes the extra mile. Her place is awesome (backyard was really nice for a drink too!)

"I came to Montréal for a conference at L'Université de Montréal in November 2017. Fanny is the consummate host and her place is very comfortable, clean, and in the best location in Montreal! Definitely stay here if you are looking for a place that is quiet, clean, and close to the best bars and restaurants in Montreal (Dieu du Ciel!, Aux Vivres, Gus, among others). The neighbourhood is fantastic, full of nice restaurants and little boutiques, and when I was there (late Fall) the streets were lit at night with fairy lights in the trees--quite magical! Transit is also easily accessible (buses and subways are close by), and downtown Montréal is not far. Fanny is extremely welcoming and immediately made me feel comfortable in her home, which is beautiful (with a STUNNING back deck). I loved staying here and would come back!","10"
"Fanny is the sweetest. Timely communication, friendly, and provided lots of tips on what to see and do. Her place is great - very clean, quiet, and in a hip neighborhood full of restaurants and vintage shops (my favorite). Would stay here again in a heartbeat!","10"

The apartment is just a short walk from every good spot in Mile End, and the nearby subway and bus stops make it very easy to reach the rest of Montreal.","10"
"My stay at Fanny's place couldn't have been better, not only she is a great host she is an amazingly inspiring human being. Her hospitality is a joy and her local recommendations amazing. Her flat is super well located at one of the coolest neighborhoods in Montreal. I would DEFINITELY love to come back!","10"
"It was a lovely stay! I chose ""much better than I expected"" not because I didn't expect much, but because I want to express how much I loved it. Fanny is a wonderful hostess who goes with the flow while at the same time being super reliable and accurate in terms of description of the place. The room is sweet and quiet, and the entire apartment has a very warm feel and ambiance. Despite it being arctic cold in the city, the place was well heated and I wasn't cold at all. The neighborhood offers great cafes, restaurants and easy access to other parts of Montreal. I can highly recommend!","10"
"Fanny's place was great! We were there on a very cold weekend, but there were lots of great bars and restaurants still in walking distance to enjoy. I'm sure it would be even more amazing in the summer, especially with her cute back porch. The room was excellent, exactly as pictured. It also felt like we had a lot of privacy, even though we just rented the room.","10"
"Fanny's place was just fantastic. Spacious room, great flat, great kitchen with everything you could ever need and amazing host. I stayed there for one week, and couldn't have asked for a better place. It's located in the heart of the hippest place in Montreal and perhaps one of the hippest places on earth, still the surroundings was very quiet. I had allot of good conversations with fanny and felt really like home. Thank you for amazing hosting.","10"
"J'ai passé un excellent séjour dans l'appartement de Fanny. Tout est parfait, l'emplacement, le calme, la chambre, la propreté. Fanny a été une hôte très accueillante qui nous fait très vite se sentir comme chez soi.

"It was a perfect stay at Funnys apartment! The room was cozy, lightly and quiet, the location was awesome! Many cafés, bars and restaurants close by and everything is walkable even Mont royal. Downtown or old montreal is walkable but it takes arround 30-40 mins, but for me it was good to see as much as I could from montreal through walking instead of taking the public transportation! So I would definitely recommend funnys place to discover the city, even for a short trip which I did (2 days)! 
Funny is also a very nice, lovely and open person, we had a nice talk!","10"
"A lovely room in a peaceful and bright apartment with a wonderful host. I slept so well here and loved my time sitting on the deck eating croissants and bagels. Fanny is a great host:  kind, interesting and welcoming.","10"

"Awesome Airbnb experience! 
Fanny is a very welcoming, open and friendly host. She also gave me great local tips. The room was indeed very cozy and quiet, I slept well and felt like home. The location is just perfect! The next metro is within 10 minutes walking distance and the next bus to the old port is even in 1 minute walking distance. There are plenty of unique restaurants and bars nearby, the well-known Mont Royal is also not far away.
I would definitively stay at Fannys place again if I come to Montréal again!
Merci beaucoup!","10"
"I stayed at Fanny’s place for a week. It looks exactly as described. Very clean and quiet.  It is located in a very nice area with fresh air, 10 min walk to Laurier metro station, bus stop right near the house. There are numerous cafes and restaurants around,  2 small parks. Fanny was very helpful  and friendly. I really enjoyed my visit. ","10"
"Good location and nice spot!","10"
"Fanny’s place was awesome and the location was perfect. The apartment was right in Mile’s End, and was walkable to Saint lawerence st, st. Viater and fairmont bagels, and much more. Her apartment was clean and the outdoor deck was the cutest. Fanny was amazing, making check in super easy and would let us know whenever there was an event going on in town. I would definitely stay here again!","10"
"L'accueil de Fanny est parfait la chambre et l'appartement sont très agréables et la terrasse un vrai bonheur.
Merci à Fanny pour ses bon conseils pendant notre séjour ","10"
"Fanny's place is right in the middle of a really cool neighborhood. Bars and cafes and restaurants are all around her.  I wasn't sure if it might be off the beaten path, but it was very close to nightlife. The Plateau/Mile End neighborhoods are the cool neighborhoods to check out if you want fine dining and a hip scene.  

My wife and I spent a weekend at Fanny's apartment and she gave us some great local tips on our arrival. The two-bedroom apartment is stylish and clean and her large back porch is nice for a quiet break from the busy neighborhood. She even let us borrow her clothes steamer when my shirt was too wrinkled from the suitcase!","10"
"Fanny is a lovely, welcoming and easy-going host. Staying at her place gave us, although it is a shared one, enough privacy as a couple. It is located in the heart of Mile-end, lots of nice places in walkable distance. Overall we had a wonderful stay at Fanny's, definitely can recommend hers!","10"
"This is the second time I stayed at Fanny's, and I was very happy to come back. Her place location is fantastic, in a very exciting neighborhood and easy to reach downtown. She is very welcoming and fun to be around. I greatly recommend asking her for her list of nearby restaurants and bars, she has the best selection!","10"
"Fanny was an excellent host and very responsive. She was very helpful in the public transportation/getting around piece since I didn't have a car. Her place is in a perfect location that is walking distance to a lot of the cool restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. There is one particular coffee shop literally across the street that was amazing. I would definitely stay there again.","10"
"Great location and good communication, would definitely stay here again.","10"
"I am sure the hostess is a kind and generous person with many insights to Montreal. Because of omissions in the listing and events that occurred after my arrival, I chose not to stay.

Fanny offered to email a list of places to eat. I left the US on the 19th. The email was received on the 20th. Because of limited internet access and Data Roaming Charges, I was not checking my email after I left home.

I left my bag at the room while I was searching for parking. The room is off the kitchen. It was 83 degrees outside that evening and the room was even warmer. The bed and a fan were next to the window. I could see the patio table and chairs from my pillow. Fanny apologized, saying the comforter was in the dryer. We laughed thinking it was not needed. 

As I have done many times before, I prefer to park my car and walk a city. Parking here is limited to parking meters or Resident Permit parking. There are no parking garages. There is no off street parking. Construction on side streets further reduced available parking. While walking I was bumped by a motorist coming out of an alley and hit a second time by a bicyclist traveling in the wrong direction. I spent 20 minutes circling the neighborhood looking for parking. Meanwhile, the police, a tow truck, and an ambulance were collecting a motorcyclist at the corner of Av Laurier and Saint Urbain in front of Lio Fratelli. 

I invested a considerable amount of time planning my trip to Montreal. It was not my plan to spend a beautiful summer evening driving in traffic translating No Parking signs. Had I known in advance that there was no parking, I would have spent the $200 for air conditioning, room service,  and parking elsewhere. It was not worth the risk to stay. I was looking forward to seeing this great city. After driving seventeen hours, I drove another five and I arrived at home in the the US at 12:30 AM

","10"
"Fanny's place is very cute, clean, and homey. I didn't stay for long, so I wasn't able to take full advantage, but the terrace is great. Overall it is well maintained and comfoetable, and Fanny is very sweet. The area is very cool, just about 10 minutes from the Subway and with lots of restaurants and shops. I look forward to staying here again.","10"
"Fanny's place is great. The place is located in a great neighborhood with walking distance to the metro (about 10-12 mins) and there are many great breakfast/restaurants/bars around. 
The place is stylish and comfortable as described. The patio is particularly great.  Even though I need to share bathroom with Fanny, but she is very accommodating to the guests, I feel like I have the bathroom to myself through out my stay. 

Fanny is a great host who is communicative and easy to talk to. And she keeps a low profile to give the guests enough privacy which I really appreciate. I also got a lot of local tips for good places to eat and visit fro her.

Overall great experience, highly recommend","10"
"Very nice, clean, peacfull and well located appartment. close to everything, parc, coffee shop, bakery, metro, pub, restaurant... we enjoyed the breakfast and the nice terrace too! Fanny also very nice. I’ll definitly recommanded and will come back if need to stay again in Montreal! ","10"

Incredibly friendly people, despite my awful attempts at their beautiful language. Then there’s the space.. relaxing, comforting, beautiful! And then there is the super host... this is why air bnb is amazing.. people like Fanny. This is what travel to a new city should be like.. if you want a true experience of the city and it’s incredible culture! ","10"
"Perfect apartment in a great Mile End location! Fanny was an awesome host and  provided helpful information on the best local restaurants and sights to see. The location is very walkable and also close to bus lines and metro. The space is just as described, spacious comfortable and clean. Highly recommended!!","10"
"Fanny's apartment is a perfect place to call home while you get to know Montreal. Positioned in a hip and trendy part of the city, there are amazing bars, restaurants, and cafes within just a few blocks. The rest of the sights to see in the city are either a manageable walk or quick uber or bus ride away. The room is clean and relaxing, the back terrace is beautiful and even thought you're in the bustle of the city, the apartment is quiet and tranquil. Fanny is so sweet, friendly, and helpful. You'll love staying with Fanny, I can't recommend it enough!","10"

"L’appartement de Laurence était parfait! Exactement comme sur les photos! Il est à côté du métro, à 1 min du marche, et c’est vraiment super pratique pour aller en centre-ville. Tout était super propre!! Laurence m’avait même laissé un petit cadeau et du bon café pour mon séjour! L’appartement est spacieux, le lit confortable, j'y ai très bien dormi.  Laurence est un excellent guide.  Elle connait très bien son quartier, ou manger, ou prendre le meilleur café.  Il y a une connexion internet très rapide à l'appartement, mais il y a aussi des cafés très agréables tout près si vous sentez le besoin de sortir.  Laurence était disponible pour répondre à mes questions.  Je reviendrai très bientôt dans son appartement.","10"

Très bel appartement, exactement comme sur les photos. Lumineux, bien décoré, grand garde-robe d'entrée très pratique. L'appartement est très bien situé, à côté du métro alors c'était très facile de se déplacer.

"Laurence place was a dream home and is located at a perfect location. There are dozens of gem restaurants within walking distance and the subway was less than 5 mins away. There is also Shoppers(drug store) right at the doorstep if any misc. items was needed. Laurence place was amazingly comfortable; I would look forward to coming back home after a long day of exploring. There was a comfortable bed, supplied towels and hair dryer, TV with HDMI cable, variety of dishware and utensils. If we were to come back to Montreal, Laurence place would be the place to stay at!","10"
"Laurence is everything you could ask for in a host. My plane was delayed fairly late into the evening but she was at the flat to welcome me and get me oriented. She had prepared a super map of the area marking all the special places for shopping, cafes and so on AND she left a bunch of goodies for breakfast which was so appreciated. The flat is fabulous. Super clean, bright, and very well equipped. There is even a little balcony. It is kitty corner to the De L'eglise metro so you have easy access to public transit. I loved the neighbourhood which is an up and coming area with tons of cafes, quirky shops, grocery stores, fruit stands and more. A super bonus is that the river is just a couple of blocks away. I had a great time and highly recommend it. ","10"

Fabulous with a kind and personable owner, ready to help with anything. Merci, Laurence!","10"
"Our host Laurence was wonderful! She gave us a tour of the condo unit and even created a little guide to Verdun. Me and my boyfriend ended up eating at most of the restaurants she recommended in the neighbourhood! The home is sleek, clean and a great space to spend a city vacation in. It's location is perfect sliver of a local Montreal lifestyle. Laurence was so kind and thoughtful and kept in contact with us when we had any questions. I would definitely spend time here again. :)","10"
"Laurence's home was beautiful, extremely clean, and in a great neighbourhood. Not only was this newly-built condo one block from a metro station that would bring you downtown within 10 minutes, pretty much all amenities were walking distance. Laurence was a lovely host who greeted us for our evening arrival and made sure we had everything we could need during our stay. I would recommend this home to anyone who wants to stay in Montreal!","10"
"Laurence's home was exceptionally kept and exactly as described. Verdun was very quiet area with free parking. Apartment was exceptionally clean, very cozy, and close to all the amenities and Metro. Laurence is an extremely seasoned Airbnb host that took care of all the necessities and even provided a list of recommended places to eat around the area and greeted us when we got in. Highly recommend this place.","10"
"My partner and I agree that this was our favourite airbnb experience. Laurence's apartment is absolutely perfect. Laurence made our check in experience hassle free and her attention to detail in this place is amazing. Could not fault this place in any way.","10"
"Laurence m'a accueilli avec le sourire, offrant son aide pour transporter mes mille et un sacs, et s'est montrée très flexible concernant l'horaire et ses disponibilités lors de la planification de mon séjour, ce que j'ai apprécié au plus haut point. L'appartement était magnifique, très propre, lumineux, bien équipé (de tout pour cuisiner!), exactement comme sur les photos et même mieux encore à mon avis! Le cadeau de bienvenu fût très apprécié et la carte avec les suggestions de restaurants nous a été fort utile. Un vrai moment de détente dans un espace absolument idéal pour les amoureux de la nature urbaine!","10"
"We had a great stay at Laurence's place, perfect location and the place is beautiful! We had an easy time finding the place and there is plenty of parking nearby, even though you can get downtown in no time.

We'd highly recommend a stay with Laurence if you're in Montreal!","10"
"I would live here if I could! Laurence's home is fantastic. It was very clean, well kept and had a lot of amenities. It has been my favorite airbnb experience to date. Laurence is very kind and left me wonderful breakfast foods to dine on.  The neighborhood is nice with good parking.  If you haven't been yet, you should definitely try it out. ","10"
"We very much enjoyed staying at Laurence's condo. The place was amazing and we had everything we need for a great stay. It felt very much like home. Laurence had also left us some food for breakfast and was very patient with us regarding our arrival. Metro is very close to the condo and is a very quick drive away from the city centre. We recommend this place to others without hesitation.","10"
"Beautiful condo. Extremely clean. Laurence gave us some great recommendations that made our stay extremely memorable. We will definitely be back. Thank you so much Laurence.","10"
"Laurence's listing and photos were very accurate, portraying the apartment well. The neighborhood is residential and quiet, though there are a handful of nice restaurants and cafes nearby. The subway/metro is very close by to the apartment (perhaps a three minute walk) and allows for convenient travel to pretty much every aspect of Montreal.

Though I was not able to meet Laurence personally due to an emergency, she did make me feel welcomed by leaving fruit and bread in the apartment as a little snack for the next morning. In addition, there was a cute welcome note scrawled on a small chalkboard near the front door and a list of her favorite nearby hangout spots.

All in all, it was a great experience and I would stay here again the next time that I travel to Montreal!","10"
"Very nice apartment in a good location, close to most services that you need. Host was very welcoming and provided great information on everything related to the apartment and the Verdun area. 

Thanks Laurence, we enjoyed our stay.","10"

"Laurence was a great host! She generously provided us with various treats as well as detailed recommendations. The apartment was clean and quiet in a great and charming location with easy access to boutiques and the metro. We would love to be able to stay there again.","10"
"Super séjour chez Laurence. Appartement conforme à la description et accessible avec le metro qui est situé à 2 minutes. Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer Laurence et malgré notre arrivée tardive, elle nous a mis les clés à disposition. Nous avons fortement apprécié le pain et confiture pour le premier petit déjeuner ainsi que la mise à disposition plans de la ville de Montréal. Nous recommandons cet hôte avec qui nous réserverons à nouveau lors de notre prochaine venue.

Great Montréal experience! The appartment is as described and located nearby the metro (2 minutes walk distance). We did not get the oppprtunity to meet Laurence in person. Despite our late arrival in the evening, she made it possible for us to get the keys. Moreover, we appreciated the bread and jam provided for our first breakfast and the maps of the city. We will book with Laurence again should we have the opportunity to come to Montréal again.","10"
"This appartment was really amazing. Me and my boyfriend stayed there for 2 nights and immediately felt at home.
The apartment was very new, clean and beautifully furnished. It's only a 2 Minute walk to the subway station and parking was possible in front of the house. The key exchange was easy and Laurence very helpful. She even left us some fruit and bread for breakfast in her kitchen and made us a list/map with the best places around (supermarket, restaurants, bakerys etc.). I really would recommend this appartment to everybody who wants to visit Montreal.","10"
"We loved staying at Laurence's condo! It's exactly as pictured. The place is very clean and organized. Perfect location - metro station is right around the corner. We didn't get to meet Laurence on our trip but she was very helpful and kind! She left us breakfast for the first morning, maps and recommendations for our trip. Check in and check out was smooth and convenient. If we come back to Montreal we will definitely stay here again! 

We had a great time - thanks for everything Laurence! ","10"
"My friend and I traveled Montreal and stayed at Laurence's place. I was shocked when we got there. This place was so fabulous and cozy over our imagining.  It was super clean and well decorated. Laurence also left us some food and drinks.We loved this place because it was like home.","10"
"Nous sommes très satisfaits de notre séjour à Montréal au mois de septembre 2015 . L'appartement situé à Verdun était ce que nous recherchions . 
( situation , confort  , Metro..)
Nous espérons pouvoir y retourner l'an prochain.","10"
"Laurence's place was absolutely lovely and perfect for our little family. It was very tastefully decorated and cozy, and we felt right at home immediately. Laurence was always readily available and easy to contact for any questions. We had issues with the WiFi the first day, but she had it fixed the next day for us. I highly recommend staying here, it's beautiful with great access to the subway. ","10"
"She left us some fresh French bread and jelly for our breakfast, along with a welcoming message on the blackboard. Everything was immaculately clean and the apartment was quite trendy and new.","10"
"We had a great stay. The condo was very cozy and the pictures were accurate. We are hoping to stay here again in the future.","10"
"Laurence was extremely helpful, making my stay in Montréal absolutely wonderful. Check in was smooth and Laurence's condo was exactly as described; it was not hard to feel at home there. Overall, I rate Laurence a warm and accommodating host. ","10"
"Laurence's apartment was one of the highlights of our trip. The apartment is exactly like the pictures on the listing, beautiful decor and very clean. It's located right of the main street where all the restaurants and stores are. The neighborhood is very quite and lovely. She left a lovely sign, fresh bread, orange juice, recommendations, and was quick on responses. I definitely recommend staying here!","10"
"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans l'appartement de Laurence. Nous nous sentions comme chez nous. Tout est prévu, nous ne manquions de rien. Très bien situé car en face du métro pour se rendre en quelques stations dans le centre ville de Montreal. Et tout sur place pour faire l'épicerie. Nous recommandons vivement cette adresse. ","10"
"The apartment was well appointed and very clean. Great location in Verdun","10"
"Fantastic condo! Fantastic location! Fantastic host!!!! Everything was as described and super clean! Not only will I stay here again but I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a beautiful place minutes from downtown Montreal. Thanks Laurence!
","10"
"Génial! Super appartement, accueil impeccable. Très beau séjour. Merci à Laurence.","10"
"This stay couldn't have been better.  The apartment was exactly as described -- bright, clean, comfortable and quiet.  It's a very attractive space with large windows, big closets, and perfect couch and chair to watch tv or curl up and read. We have long been a fan of Verdun, and this is perfectly located near the metro, several cafes, a couple of blocks to the IGA, organic produce around the corner, the fromagerie further down Wellington and the beautiful park (even in the snow and cold of April) that stretches for miles along the St. Lawrence.   ","10"
"5 stars!!!!! I cannot imagine how our stay could have been any better.

Laurence was an absolutely wonderful hostess. She left a few breakfast foods for us to enjoy on our first morning (bananas, a loaf of bread, yogurt, juice). Very thoughtful! She left guidebooks of Montreal for both of us and even printed a map of Verdun with personal suggestions of her favourite cafes, shops, and attractions. A local's input is invaluable. We did visit a few of her favourite spots and were very pleased. Thank you, Laurence! 

As for the apartment itself, it was modern, bright, spacious, and very clean. The photos posted do in fact reflect the reality. I loved waking up to this calming space and coming home there after a day of sightseeing. It was truly a place where we could relax. 

The neighbourhood was great, with many cafes and shops to explore on the main street (Wellington). For non-Quebec residents who are GoodLife members, you can use your membership to work out at Energie Cardio, which is a 10-min walk down the street. That was a nice bonus for me, since I was away from my regular gym for a whole week. The subway stop (A l'Eglise) was indeed just a minute's walk away. Sometimes, I travelled by myself, and I can assure you that I felt safe coming home at night all alone. 

One word of warning for those whose parallel parking is not up to snuff: parking can get tight on the street. I noticed this is typical of Montreal in general, not just this neighbourhood. Start practising now, folks! ","10"
"Espectacular!! lo puedo resumir en una palabra.. nos encantó desde el momento de nuestra llegada Laurence (quien habla Franes, Ingles y Español) ya había hecho arreglos para hacernos sentir como en casa, nos tenia listas algunas cosas en la nevera, frutas y un letrero de bienvenida, así como una pequeña cuna para nuestro hijo de 2 años, estuvo muy atenta a nuestras inquietudes y nos aconsejó muy buenos sitios para conocer, nos entregó algunos mapas del metro, el sector es excelente para recién llegados (tiene tiendas muy económicas y excelentes restaurantes multiculturales), ademas el metro queda solo a 1 minuto a pie. La casa tenia absolutamente todo lo necesario para preparar cualquier comida, sus electrodomésticos están en muy buen estado, así como todo el interior. de verdad fue muy difícil decirle adiós al apartamento de Laurence, nuevamente gracias por todo..","10"
"We loved our visit to Verdun. It is a great neighborhood, with great bicycle trails. Laurence's condo is very pretty and cozy too. ","10"
"Nous avons passé un magnifique mois dans l'appartement de Laurence qui est aussi beau en vrais que sur les photos. L'appartement est moderne, bien équipé et très lumineux. En plus de la terrasse privée, Il dispose notamment d'une très belle terrasse commune sur le toit. L'emplacement est très agréable car le quartier est vivant et il y fait bon vivre mais surtout à quelques minutes à pied du Saint Laurent. 

Laurence nous a très bien reçu et est très disponible.

Nous recommandons fortement ce logement.

Samuel & Alexandra","10"
"The apartment was absolutely perfect for our month long stay in Montreal. It had everything we could need and is steps away from the metro, connecting you to the rest of Montreal. Verdun is a charming neighborhood and was great to go for a run in the morning right on the St. Lawrence. 

Laurence went above and beyond during our stay. She was incredibly communicative and very helpful, even with the littlest things. ","10"
"Comfortable stay!","10"
"This is great, relatively modern 1-bedroom unit, very clean and fully equipped in the Verdun neighborhood of Montreal. A couple minutes walk from the ""de L'Eglise"" metro stop and a Bixy bike share station. This is not a touristy neighborhood but more of a regular neighborhood for the Montrealais - and that is what I was looking for. Easy bike ride to a wonderful park and bike path along the St. Laurent river. The unit has everything you need for a nice stay in Montreal and the owner, Laurence, is very ""sympa"". ","10"
"100% recomendable, el departamento de Laurence es exactamente igual a las fotos  y mucho mejor , totalmente equipado, funcional , limpio y moderno. La bienvenida que nos dio Laurence fué una grata sorpresa !  , Laurence tiene todo preparado para que te sientas muy bien . El departamento se ubica en un lindo barrio lleno de cafeterias, restaurantes , bares y mucho mas , a 2 calles se localiza el metro y a un par de pasos el Río San Lorenzo. No lo duden ni un segundo, éste lugar tiene una categoría AAA","10"
"몬트리올을 여행하실 분들께 강력추천하는 숙소입니다. 위치는 올드몬트리올 기준으로 중심지와는 조금 거리가 있는 한적한 주택가지만 숙소에서 지하철역이 말도 안되게 가까우며 대부분의 몬트리올의 번화가는 지하철타고 30분 이내로 갈 수 있기때문에 전혀 불편함을 못느꼈고 오히려 숙소 근처가 조용해서 편안하고 좋았습니다. 숙소 근처에 드럭스토어와 마트가 가까이 있다는 점도 매우 좋습니다. 숙소 내부는 정말 말그대로 없는게 없습니다. 세탁기와 건조기가 있어서 여행내내 너무 편하게 세탁했고, 식기도 정말 다양하게 이용했습니다. 집도 정말 깨끗하고 인테리어도 훌륭합니다. 정말 더할나위없이 좋은 숙소였고 다시 몬트리올에 온다면 또 예약하고 싶은 숙소입니다!","10"
"Laurence's place is lovely! Nice and clean, big windows allow space to feel open and bright. All the amenities you need in the apartment. Location is close to the train to the city, about 30 mins. She responded promptly to any inquiries and was pleasant to work with. We enjoyed our stay!","10"
"This was my second time staying at Laurence's place. My 5-week-long-stay was outstanding! The condo is very clean and modern, and had many amenities to make my stay very comfortable. Laurence is a very gracious host and she  checked up on me periodically to make sure everything was in order. The location is great...Wellington Street has everything you require including grocery stores, restaurants and shops which are all a short walk away. Bus stops and a metro station are also near by for easy access to explore everything Montreal has to offer.  I highly recommend Laurence's condo to anyone looking for a beautiful place minutes from downtown Montreal. Thanks Laurence!","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Laurence’s condo is absolutely amazing! Very spacious and stocked with everything you could possibly need. It’s perfectly located by rue Wellington, which has bakeries, cafés, bookshops, pharmacies and grocery stores. You don’t even have to leave the area to have an authentic Montreal experience, but if you want to the de l’église and Verdun metro stations on the green line are within walking distance, and so are local bus routes. Cannot recommend this gem of a place enough!","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"My husband and I really enjoyed staying at Laurence’s condo. It feels very homy with all the personal touch- it’s almost like staying at our own apartment!  It is very clean and well-maintained. The facilities are complete, it has everything we need.  She even stocked the fridge for us! Location-wise it’s perfect, just 2 minutes from nearest metro station from where we can go anywhere across  Montreal. It has a nice balcony where had a quiet dinner with a good bottle of wine.  All in all it was a very enjoyable stay.","10"
"Laurence’s condo is perfectly located close to public transit, shops and restaurants. It is very clean and very well kept. Laurence was a prompt and helpful host. I would highly recommend her condo to anyone looking to head to Montreal. Merci!","10"
"Laurence's apt was great! She was super accommodating and responsive to inquiries. She checked in on us after the first day and left thoughtful touches like recs and food. The apt is very convenient to the metro and everything you would need. She let us store our luggage when our flight was leaving after check out time. The AC was a lifesaver during Montreal's heatwave! Highly recommend.","10"
"We loved our five night stay in this clean and quiet little condo. The location was perfect, just steps to the metro in a cool neighbourhood. 

Laurence was great! She was super organized and very thoughtful. She even provided a few things for breakfast or first morning which was really appreciated. 

After long days of sightseeing (during a heatwave), it was such a relief to walk in the doors of our air conditioned home away from home. We’d definitely stay here again.  Merci beaucoup!","10"
"A wonderful stay!! If you’re looking for somewhere outside the city but easy access to everything this is perfect! Just a short walk from train station, markets and much more! Laurence has the best hospitality and was easy to contact, she even gave wonderful suggestions on places to eat and much more!","10"
"We had an incredible time in Verdun. The apartment was everything we hoped for. Merci!","10"
"Nous avons réservé sur AirBn'B pour la 1ère fois avec l'appartement de Laurence cet été et avons été agréablement surpris  au-delà de nos attentes
Tout est dit sur le site (emplacement, accueil, conseils, propreté, hospitalité, confiance...)  nous donnons 5 étoiles sans hésiter !!!

"We appreciated Laurence's thoughtfulness of providing breakfast for the first day. Her home was very comfortable and clean. Her condo was in a convenient location near a metro station, and the neighborhood had many stores and restaurants. Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend and return in the future. ","10"
"Great place! Laurence was a very informative host, we loved her space and the location. It was very bright and clean - great natural light and a lovely quiet balcony where we enjoyed lots of coffee.  The apartment comes with everything you need, is one block from the metro and just back less than half a block from Wellington St. which is full of life and shops. There was even a puppet festival and sidewalk sale while we were there. There are also great cycling and walking paths along the St. Laurence, just a block or so away. The only thing we'd note is we found the bed quite firm but we absolutely loved everything else.

Thanks Laurence for a great stay. We highly recommend staying here.","10"
"Very friendly host, charming place","10"
"So much better than I expect. Definitely one of the best airbnb experience in my life. Highly recommended!","10"

Emplacement idéal, proximité des restaurants ainsi que du métro...
Nous recommandons fortement !","10"
"Appartement très bien situé.Près du métro. Près des magasins.À 5 minutes d'un parc au bord du fleuve. Décoration très personnelle et chaleureuse. Parfois même de la musique d'orgue de la petite église tout près. J'y retournerais avec plaisir.","10"

"Great apartment in a posh downtown location.","9"
"This unit was everything as advertised. The location was spectacular - literally less than 5 minutes walk from Place d'Arms Metro station (orange line) and less than 10 minutes walk from Place d'Arts Metro station (green line). This made it so so easy to see different parts of the city via the Metro and our trip experience was definitely heightened by this. From midway up the building you have an amazing  view of both Old Montreal and the Musée des Arts. The balcony is the perfect size for two people to sit and have their morning coffee. The unit was clean, the linens crisp and it was equipped with air conditioning, which was a welcome relief from the 32 degree Celsius weather outside. You have access to a gym, pool and terrasse that also has a beautiful view. Mike's assistant Vincent was extremely patient with us after we arrived later than anticipated due to road construction. He gave us great tips about the city and the immediate vicinity which helped us plan our week. Overall, the location, stunning view and well laid-out unit made this trip a 10/10. We would definitely recommend Mike's Superior Condo to family and friends traveling to Montreal!","9"
"Beautiful place in the heart of downtown Montreal. It was our first time visiting and the location was perfect. Walk to pretty much anything. The apartment is immaculate, the building is super nice, and the doormen are very friendly. The apartment is exactly like the pictures, nothing more.","9"
"Great apartment. Central location, well equiped, very comfortable. Would definitely recommend if you want something central in Montreal. Only minus was no toilet paper, but it's easily fixable with supermarket two blocks away!","9"
"The place was in a fabulous location, was extremely clean, and well-kept. Overall we had a very comfortable stay. However, we paid approx. $150 extra to add a third person to our reservation, but we did not get a third key nor did we get additional rolls of toilet paper when we asked Mike for more after we used our two provided rolls. It would have been nice to receive an extra key and a third roll of toilet paper for the extra $150 it cost to have a third person.","9"
"Mike's place is incredible. It is the perfect walking distance to really great shops and restaurants. Mike was very helpful and great with communication! We would definitely stay again!!","9"
"We really loved to stay here. Everything was well prepared and communicated by Mike. Apartment is as shown in the pictures and points of interest in Montreal are near by. The view onto Old Town and St. Lawrence river are fantastic. We would definitly go there again.","9"
"Location, location, location! 
Cozy condo in the heart of downtown mtl! Great gym, pool! Super clean apt, perfect for a couple and the pullout couch is super comfortable! I would definitely stay there during my next stay in Montreal! Perfection!","9"

"Appartement jouissant d’une très belle vue.  A 2 pas de la place des Arts. Très central. L’appartement est très confortable et propre. Indications très précises pour l’arrivée et le départ.  
Nous reviendrons","9"
"Perfect location to enjoy the great city of Montreal. But ask Mike if the apartment has been fixed and is ready to welcome guests. Too many and basic things that were not in order when we stayed 10 days in January 2019.","9"

"Première expérience Air BandB réussie!! Pamela est une hôte très accueillante et très patiente (elle m'a attendue jusqu'à mon arrivée à 22h30). L'appartement est conforme à la description et il est très proche du métro Beaubien et de toutes commodités. Le centre ville est accessible en 15 mn. Merci encore pour ce séjour formidable.","10"

"Pamela a ete tres accueillante et disponible, un charme.","10"
"We had an amazing time at Pamela's place, she welcomed us warmly and explained to us everything about the apartment and neighbourhood. Super friendly and helpful, she made herself available to us by email or phone for any questions we had about anything. 
The apartment is big, very clean and super sunny :) Very comfortable bed. Grocery store and liquor store at the corner, very close to Beaubien metro station, 2 blocks away from St Hubert shops, tons of restaurants and bars - the location is great - about 15 mins from downtown. Would definitely stay here again :) Thank you Pamela and Fernando for your hospitality !   ","10"
"The apartment was just like in the pictures. The location was very good close to the metro and near dowtown. We stayed 11 days. During that time, we experienced lot of noise coming from the other apartments, we could hear everything that was happening downstairs in the owner's house. The oven was also so dirty it even started the fire alarm when we tried to preheat it. The bathroom also had visible mold on the ceiling. Pamela and her husband also refused to give us the wifi password forcing us to wait for them for every electronic apparatus we had. The bed kept breaking. We had lots of trouble reaching Pamela or her husband on the first day although when we did they were very nice and kind to us.","10"
"Je suis restée dans l'appartement pour une nuit. C'est un bel appart. Tout était bien aménagé et complet. Pamela m'a chaleureusement accueilli et m'a tout expliqué même quand j'étais là que pour un nuit. Elle était très flexible sur l'heure du départ. Je vous recommande donc cet appartement.","10"
"Pamela was a great host. She contacted us in advance to be sure we would either meet or have the entrance code for the door. That was so helpful because we were driving and couldn't say exactly when we'd arrive.  The listing was accurate and we were very pleased with the sweet little apartment. The neighborhood is residential and quiet, but has convenient shopping right around the corner. It was also so convenient to be around the corner from a Metro stop. The mattress was fabulous! We had a wonderful time there.","10"
"J'ai vraiment apprécié mon espace. L'appartement était tel que décrit et très propre. Le lit est très confortable. J'ai été chaleureusement accueillie par Pamela. L'appart est vraiment bien situé et à proximité de tout. Je connais bien le quartier et le recommande fortement. Merci encore!","10"

"Thanks Pamela for making our stay exceptionally comfortable. Your apartment had everything we needed and you guys were very helpful. We had a great time,  and hope to return again someday!","10"
"Pamela was an excellent host, very friendly and always offered prompt and thorough responses. The place was clean and has great light. It is only rented out, not lived in, so it feels more like a hotel than someone's apartment. It's really close to the metro, the neighbourhood is charming, and the best coffee in town is 10 mins away at Odessa. ","10"
"This place was clean, hosts were friendly and reliable, the pictures are accurate, overall great experience.","10"
"Pamela and Fernando were excellent hosts. My girlfriend and I enjoyed their apartment and loved the neighborhood. Look forward to staying with them again.","10"

The apartment was very cozy and perfect for us. We loved Montreal and staying at their place made the trip even more fabulous! We look forward to staying with them again in the future! Thank you guys! =)","10"
"We found our hosts Pamela & Fernando to be communicative, friendly and helpful- thank you! The apartment was as pictured and described, in a good location just a short walk from the metro with some nice cafes and a grocery store nearby. We had a very busy itinerary and only needed basic accommodations for sleeping and bathing and this apartment was a nice fit for us - a good price, a comfortable mattress and fairly close to where we needed to be. Thanks again!","10"
"J'ai profité du studio de Pamela & Fernando une nuit, le temps d'un petit répit de famille, et cela m'a fait un bien fou! La grandeur est parfaite pour une personne ou pour un couple et l'appartement est nimbé de lumière naturelle, ce qu'il est fort agréable. De plus, les hôtes sont discrets et très accueillants. Ce n'est pas très bien insonorisé, comme tous les appartements de Montréal, mais ce n'est qu'un détail sur lequel Pamela & Fernando n'ont malheureusement pas de pouvoir, alors comment leur en vouloir? Les râleurs n'ont qu'à aller à l'hôtel, après tout! Moi, j'aurais bien profité de petit appartement quelques journées de plus!","10"
"Pamela and Fernando were amazing hosts, and were lovely enough to welcome my boyfriend and I into their home for an evening chat! They were very communicative, the apartment was delightful, just as shown in the pictures. The apartment was close to all amenities, and I will be definitely staying with them the next time I am back in Montreal. Thank you! ","10"
"The apartment was excellent and even better than it looks in the photos! It was very private and pretty quiet. It was very easy to get to the metro and everything you need is within walking distance. Checking in was easy and straightforward and Pamela made sure that we were enjoying ourselves and made herself available to us if we needed anything. If I ever get back to Montreal, I will definitely stay with Pamela and Fernando again!","10"
"Nous avons été très bien accueillies par Pamela elle-même. L'appartement était parfait pour deux personnes, propre et bien équipé. À deux pas du métro Beaubien et près de très bons restos(Pâtes bol!). On le recommande fortement!","10"
"I had a short but wonderful stay here. The place is huge, clean, well-lit, and very conveniently located. Pamela sent me great instructions on getting there from the airport ($10 bus ride, and you can use the same ticket to transfer to the underground that takes you 3 blocks from the apartment). I especially enjoyed having Vietnamese pho a few blocks south of their apartment. Overall, an awesome experience.","10"
"Je me suis senti chez moi dans ce joli appartement situé près du métro. La description contenue sur le site Airbnb était conforme à ce que j'ai trouvé dans l'appartement qui était très propre et très tranquille. 
Je me promets d'y retourner dès que possible, pour un séjour plus long car, j'avais le sentiment d'être véritablement chez moi.

Merci à Pamela et Fernando","10"
"The apartment was clean and spacious, as well as being closely located to 2 metro stations and in a nice neighbourhood. 

Pamela and fernando were really easy to communicate with. They checked in with us before and during our stay to make sure everything was going alright. 

I would definitely return for another stay in Montreal!","10"

"Une adresse à retenir pour un excellent accueil dans un quartier peut etre un peu loin  de berri uqam mais tres bien desservi par les transports en commun. J ai passé un super sejour chez Dominic qui est chaleureux,  prevenant et attentif. La chambre est super agréable et le lit de très bonne qualité.  Franchement  je vous conseille cette adresse!! Merci encore Dominic!","10"
"Super week end passé avec Dom et Phil, deux colloc très accueillants, chaleureux, et prêts à vous donner les bons plans dans Montréal. Merci à vous deux !! ","10"
"It's my first trip to Montreal and I'm glad that Dominic and his roommate Philip hosted me! I have to thank Philip in particular for helping me check in their apartment when Dominic was away.  Having taken a greyhound bus departing quite late from NYC and arrived just too early in Montreal, I was just dying for an early check-in to lay my head down. Philip made my bed and gave me many suggestions about the city as he could, sorry Philip, I know I let you get tongue-tied many times;) Dominic was also very nice and responsive. He handed me complementary blankets just in case I might catch a cold at night. As to public transportation, it was  only 2 minutes walk to bus station 94/197, the former takes you to Station Frontenac on Green Line and the latter to Station Rosement on Orange (Website hidden by Airbnb) could always rely on STM to go to all the tourist sites, like the old port and Mont-Royal etc.There were also several grocery stores like IGA and restaurants and bars nearly. My room was spacious with a comfy bed! I should never forget to mention their lovely patio at the back, a nice spot to chill in summer! I highly recommend Dominic's place to you all!","10"
"La chambre est spacieuse et l'appartement bien équipé, je me suis sentie comme à la maison !
Dominic et Philippe sont adorables et m'ont accueilli et intégrée de suite comme leur colocataire. Cela restera un très beau souvenir pour moi, merci à vous deux !","10"
"Good place. Friendly host, willing to explain, the place is quiet even though there are a few rooms for visitors.","10"
"My husband and I spent three nights at Dominic's apartment and it worked out beautifully.  The apartment is well laid out and the room is both clean and comfortable.  There is a good amount of space and a desk for your belongings. The bed is of very good quality.  There are bus stops near to the apartment but, we prefer to walk a lot and see the city and people so we spent almost the entire time on foot.   Dominic and his roommate Philip are warm and gracious hosts who are most helpful. I would not hesitate in the least to return to this apartment on another trip back to Montreal. You will be pleased with this choice. Thank you!","10"
"Parfait airbnb !
Dom est super sympa, très sociable, en 5 minutes vous vous sentirez chez vous.
Le lieue est facilement accessible (métro à 10 min à pied, ou le bus juste en bas), un supermarché est situé en face de l'immeuble.

Si vous êtes fan de hockey, c'est l'endroit pour vous !","10"
"We had a wonderful stay with Dominic. We found him warm and engaging, and very helpful regarding information about getting around the city. His space was clean and comfortable. The area has cute restaurants lots of greenery. We rented the bixi bikes which were a short walk from Dominic's and had a great time getting to know the city that way. Highly recommend and hope to return.","10"
"Très bon accueil de Dominic. L'appartement est grand et agréable ( une belle terrasse pour déjeuner sous le soleil !). Tout a été fait pour rendre mon séjour agréable. Cela m'a permis aussi de découvrir un quartier que je ne connaissais pas !","10"
"Best of the best !","10"
"Totalmente recomendable, súper mercado y estación de bus que lleva directo al metro todo a una cuadra a la redonda. El lugar es seguro, el apartamento limpio y agradable. Dom y Phil son súper buena onda, muy amables, relajados, dispuestos a resolverte cualquier duda.","10"
"Staying at Dominic's place was great! The place is super clean and the room awesome. Right enough space for everything and really cozy. Especially the big window is a big plus! Sometimes it could be very busy in the apartment as Dominic and Phil like to invite friends. But if you are looking for a nice talk or want to get to know new people, then you shouldn't have a problem. However, if you need to go to bed early or want to work it might be a bit too busy sometimes. Dominic is a great communicator and much fun. You will feel welcome in the apt as it's cozy and everything is there (big kitchen, shampoo etc.). The best access to public transit is the 197 to Station Rosemont or the 94 to Station Frontenac. I'd definitely stay again at the place!","10"
"Dominic is a really nice host! I had a great time there. Location is perfect. Next time I would book this room again!","10"
"This place is convenience to go anywhere and Dominic is very kind and friendly. My English is poor but he spoke to me. The room that I stayed was big and cozy room. I spend a time comfortably:)
Dominic and his roommate live here and he has more 2rooms for guest. So you might meet unknown people in the morning.","10"
"Ótima estadia.","10"
"Parfait séjour d'un mois et demi ! L'appartement est cosy, la terrasse très très agréable. Le quartier est mignon, résidentiel, 2 bus amènent au métro. J'ai très bien été accueillie par Dominic et Phil. Je les recommande chaleureusement, ils sont à l'écoute, sympathiques et très drôles. C'est en partie grâce à eux que j'ai pu me sentir chez moi à Montreal à peine arrivée ! Merci !","10"
"I had such a nice stay! Everyone was lovely and Dominic had great hospitality and really helped me out with a few things. The room was a really good size and the bed was comfy. Could not recommend enough loved every second of staying here... didn’t want to leave!","10"
"Dominic's place is a very nice, clean, and affordable space to stay in Montreal. The apartment is located in a very nice, tree-lined neighborhood with supermarkets, restaurants, a park, and other amenities nearby. The bus stop to connect you to the metro is only half a block away and the metro station is only about a ten-minute bus ride away. Once you hop onto the metro, the center of the city of Montreal is only about five stops away.
The apartment is very clean and simply decorated (if you are the ""Bells and Whistles"" type of person, you won't like it as much as I did). The room is a very nice sizable room with a big window. The only drawback is that the window opens to a Boulevard and there is no escaping the outside noise whether from street traffic passing through or otherwise (if you are a light sleeper, beware of that fact and be prepared to get awakened by noise in the early hours of the morning). 
The host Dominic is very nice, very welcoming, easy going, hospitable beyond delight, and, above all, super accomodating. He gave me access  to everything in the kitchen, the livingroom, the back patio, and the bathroom. I really enjoyed my stay at Dominic's apartment and I highly recommend it to any travelers passing through Montreal (whether it's for a short stay  or a long haul)  DOMINIC  WAS  A  FANTASTIC  HOST..........!!!","10"
"dominicains nous a très bien accueilli, on se sent très vite à l'aise comme a la maison.une adresse que je recommande. Une belle rencontre même si un peu bref...... ( nous ne sommes restés que deux nuits)","10"

Le quartier est certes un peu excentré mais très agréable avec tout à proximité et calme.","10"
"Mon séjour chez Dom a été très bon, Dom et Phil ont étés très accueillants et m'ont aidés dans mes différentes démarches lors de mon arrivée à Montréal, je recommande ce logement !","10"
"Very welcoming to newcomers, spending a month in their home was better than I expected having just moved to the city. Right next to multiple bus stops and grocery stores/restaurants","10"
"I stayed with Dominic and Phil for 3months and 15 days. Dominic and Phil and Phil’s girlfriend were really easy going and easy to get a long with. I’m a bartender so I would sleep awkward times of the day and everyone respected my sleep hours and were quiet. The place was always kept clean. The room was a comfortable size and I spent a lot of time there but always felt welcome to sit and watch tv as a group or alone. They gave me my own dry space and fridge space to keep my food and had all the Necessary utensils and pots to use for cooking. Also you don’t hear any neighbors upstairs or downstairs so I always slept comfortably and well.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","8"
"It has been a very pleasant stay. In an apartment with all services and in a very interesting neighborhood. Perfect hostess. If I go back to Montréal, I'll go back to Faustine's house. Thanks for everything.","8"

"This is a great place to stay. I stayed with my girlfriend and her 3year old daughter. Plenty of space and secure. Whole apartment was very clean and Brigitte had bought us food for breakfast for us arriving. Communication was excellent at every stage. There is a Smart TV which is amazing if you want a day to chill! There are plenty of parks, grocery stores and some fantastic local cafes. On street parking near the appartment. In all this is a great place to stay and can be booked with confidence! Thank-you!","10"
"Eine wunderschöne Wohnung in guter Lage in Montreal! Die Kommunikation mit Brigitte war schon im Vorfeld sehr gut und intensiv - somit waren wir gut vorbereitet auf die Tage in Montreal und den Aufenthalt in Brigittes Appartement. Das Appartement selber war unglaublich schön eingerichtet, sauber und es fehlte an nichts - bis hin zu Kaffee, Tee, Obst, Gebäck und Croissants. Ein Tipp: Wir haben uns über (Website hidden by Airbnb) Fahrräder ausgeliehen und somit eine gute Alternative und Ergänzung zur Metro und den Bussen gefunden. Es gibt mehrere Fahrradstationen in direkter Nähe zu Brigittes Appartement. 
Vielen Dank an Brigitte - eine tolle Wohnung: 10 von 10 Sterne! :-)","10"

Le logement est un peu excentré du centre ville mais cela ne pose pas de soucis dans la mesure où le bus n°34 passe régulièrement.","10"
"Très bel appartement, grandes chambres, cuisine et salon confortables. Brigitte nous a gâté à notre arrivee: tout le nécessaire pour le petit déjeuner et le repas du soir. Vraiment très appreciable. Il y a un bon restaurant tout proche ainsi que des supérettes. Il faut environ 10 min en voiture pour aller au centre ville, 30 min en bus. Le stationnement est facile proche de l'appart.","10"

Our stay took place during a particularly cold winter week, but we were plenty warm. 

We were comfortable and appreciated the proximity to a number of good restaurants, cafés, and bars. Check out nearby Dispatch for coffee and Fieldstone for brunch.","10"

"Marie’s place was exactly as described, cute appartment with plenty of space in a nice neighborhood. I would recommend her place to anyone! Thanks Marie!","10"
"The place was as described in the listing.  The place is located in a walking distance to metro station. The market (Marché) is also near if you want to get some fresh groceries. I would recommend staying at this place.","10"
"Excellent location and apartment! It was well decorated and the photos truly displayed what it looked like. It was beautifully renovated and the bathroom was great. We really appreciated the quick communication from Marie. Since it is located on a busy street, it can be quite loud. There are great little coffee shops and restaurants all around. Overall good experience, would recommend.","10"
"Excellent","10"
"Marie's place cannot be beat as far location!  Right in the middle of amazing dining, shops and groceries.  Her apartment has great energy, is cute as hell with a deck perfect for you to ease into your day.  Check in and check out was a breeze and Marie was very responsive to our few texts sent.","10"
"Super bel endroit. On y a passé quatre nuits en famille (couple avec deux enfants 7 et 10 ans). L'appartement est à 30 minutes du vieux port et de ses musées en autobus (même chose en métro mais, honnêtement, les gens sont plus souriant dans le bus). Il est situé au-dessus d'une superbe épicerie italienne, et à moins de 10 minutes du marché Jean-Talon et du Parc Jarry (piscine, terrain sports). Il y a aussi plusieurs petits parcs avec jeux d'eau et cinéma en plain air. Et de la bonne bouffe, il y en a à profusion. On a bien aimé!","10"

easy to communicate and freindly.
Her appartment  is best location

"Nice. Spacious, location excellent, above a lovely supermarket: a little noisy due to construction","10"
"So where should I start ... 
First of all, Tanguy & Uriel, did really take a good care of us. From the booking date to the day trip, they were making sure that we got all the information needed (my wife and I) to get at their place with the minimal trouble. 
Secondly, during the time we spent there (was only one night, but I would bother staying longer if I could), they were also really pleasant, welcoming and easygoing host. 
I do really recommend their places and thank them for making our staying so great. 
At last, the location of the house, in my opinion is pretty good. Near to both the downtown and the highway (we were coming from Quebec), so easy to get in from Highway 20 and to leave too avoiding all the traffic jam)
Big up dudes !","10"
"Tanguy and Uriel are a lovely welcoming family.  They knew what time we were arriving and were waiting on the front steps to show us the beautiful newly renovated full apartment.  You open the door and it just smells clean.  Uriel has special touch in design and he has done a great job with this apartment.  The place has one bedroom and two convertible sofas in the living room, cable TV and Netflix are bonus. There was coffee, tea and a cold drinks in the fridge. From preparing for the trip to the post departure, they have been very attentive and responded quickly. We highly recommend this accommodation.  You will find yourself well taken care of with plenty of space to enjoy your travels; unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the lovely backyard as we spent all day long visiting the city.  

Profitez de votre séjour avec Tanguy et Uriel!","10"
"I had a wonderful stay at Tanguy & Uriel's place. It was a short distance to bus stops and the Metro station. And as a young woman I felt very safe in the neighbourhood at night. 

They were great hosts and let me check in almost 6 hours early to accommodate my schedule and flight time. 

I cooked in the kitchen and it had everything I needed. Everything was as pictured and the bed was comfortable. There are two couches in the living room that fold out and make comfortable beds as well.

Had a great stay!! Thanks again. ","10"
"We really enjoyed our stay!!! Tanguy and Uriel are very kind and friendly hosts. They took care of all of our needs and were easy to contact at any time.  The apartment is in the basement and although not air conditioned, we were very
comfortable at the end of June.  There is a tower fan available which we did
not need to use.  The place is stylishly decorated.  The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped.  Everything worked well. There are also two modern design couches which could become beds.  Very clean apartment.  High end rain shower with plenty of hot water.   A lovely little patio where we enjoyed a couple of our meals. Subway and grocery store
just a few minutes away.   All in all, a delight.","10"
"This place is beautiful - and in such a quaint classic neighborhood. It is fully renovated so tastefully and such a great place to call home away from home in Montréal! It is centrally located, very close to the Vieux-Port and the historic neighborhoods along the St Lawrence River and all the other action the city has to offer. It's the best of both worlds, getting to experience a quiet neighborhood while being so close to the city! Definitely recommend this spot! Tanguy and Uriel are wonderful hosts.","10"
"Place was great and clean. Washroom very nice, affordable for a great area of Montreal 10 minutes away from downtown. Would stay again, thank you for everything!! ","10"
"Oh my goodness. If you're going to Montreal, stay here! My boyfriend and I stopped by for a fabulous respite mid a month long road trip. The apartment itself is beautiful, and Tanguy and Uriel were the best hosts! They were so flexible and helpful. We loved staying with them and will be back again in the future!","10"
"Perfect location for anyone wanting easy access to everything the city has to offer. It's not more than a 5 minute walk to the grocery store and no more than 10 to the nearest metro line, perfect for a weekend getaway in Montreal!

Tanguy and Uriel are nothing but gracious hosts who want to make sure you get the best experience out of your trip, one of the best trips I've had in a while.","10"

"This is a great ground floor apartment that has useful access to busses and two metro stops with many cool places within walking distance. They live right above if you need anything and offered really good dining options when we first arrived. Tanguy and Uriel were super communicative. The bathroom and kitchen are very pretty and the shower was amazing after a long day of trekking about the city. We loved it! Thank you!","10"
"Very clean and accessible place to stay. Perfect for up to four people. About 10 minutes walk to STM train, 5 minutes walk to STM bus. $7-9 CAD Uber to La Banquise (best poutine in town!) which is on a main street with several shops. Lots of street parking. Had the privilege of running into Tanguy, Uriel, and their adorable kiddos. Awesome hosts and family, would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Tanguy and Uriel were lovely hosts. They accomodated our large group and provided extra items such as blankets and pillows evem though we didnt request them. The place was clean, modern and bigger than what we expected. The area was quiet and a quick drive to all of the places we wanted to visit for my guests. 10 star rating! Merci Beaucoup!","10"

"We loved it!","10"
"Uriel and Tanguy's place was wonderful, and exceeded all expectations! Everything was clean, linens and kitchen were well stocked, and there was plenty of room for three friends. The only minor negative was that it is not downtown, but is about a seven minute walk to an easy to navigate metro. However, it is very close to the biodome and Olympic stadium, and driving (another pro: not having to pay to park downtown, as street parking is easy at their place) is only about six minutes. What really pushed the experience over the top was the great communication skills of the host: they were super responsive before and during our stay, and it was made clear they were there if we needed anything while still respecting everyone's privacy. They were also very accommodating that one of our guests was arriving early, and even let us know when the room was ready! A great level of kindness, and a great host. Would definitely stay at their apartment again next time I'm in Montrèal","10"
"Très bonne accueil. Très bel appartement, belle décoration et très propre! Je le recommande pour un séjour à Montréal.","10"
"The place was perfect, super roomy and complete with various extra amenities. Tanguy & Uriel stocked this apartment so well, I️ was in disbelief we paid so little for it. They were extremely kind, even helping a member of my group print out his bus ticket. We ended up using uber to go downtown a lot, which was a quick 10-15 minute car ride. The price for this place caught our eyes but the apartment exceeded our expectations greatly. Best Airbnb I’ve stayed at so far! Thanks Tanguy&Uriel","10"
"Clean, spacious and you control the heat in the bedroom, kitchen, living room,  bathroom and kitchen. 

We were always able to find street parking .

Can't comment on location as we had a car.","10"
"This was a perfect choice for our family to visit Montreal! The hosts were very helpful and available. We had just enough space and everything we needed- especially with young kids. Thanks again!","10"
"Overall a good place for the price! Things were clean and the house is really close to a subway station. Because there are parking spaces nearby, it's a great place for any travellers. The only thing that was somewhat of a challenge was that we heard a lot of noises coming from the neighbourhood, but aside from that, it was a good stay!","10"
"Logement au top.. La description reflète la réalité. C’était très propre et il y a tout le nécessaire (produit de douche, produit vaisselle, thé, sel, poivre...)

The apartment was perfectly clean and Tanguy & Uriel left a very nice and helpful guide to the area. The hosts were very accommodating and recommended some wonderful restaurants, including Régine Café, which was the best brunch that I have ever had. The kitchen was stocked with some essentials as well, which was wonderful! Quiet, beautiful location with wonderful hosts. Can't wait to stay again!","10"

"Tanguy and Uriel's apartment was so lovely. Easy to get to via the metro and/or buses, cozy and accommodating for cold, stay-in nights. 

They were very understanding with the varying times that our group arrived and departed and had countless suggestions on all the places we could enjoy in Montreal. 

Great hosts!","10"
"Logement conforme et agréable","10"
"L'appartement est spacieux, bien agencé et très bien équipé (la douche est particulièrement top). Il est aussi très bien placé, proche de 2 stations de métro (5min à pied) et on a pu se garer dans la rue devant l'appartement sans frais durant la durée de notre séjour. L'accueil de Tanguy et Uriel a aussi été très chaleureux et ils ont été à disposition et réactifs dès que nous en avons eu besoin, nous fournissant de précieux conseils et infos. Enfin le rapport qualité/prix/localisation est tout simplement imbattable à Montréal. On recommande et on reviendra!","10"
"Tanguy and Uriel were model hosts - so kind and helpful! Their place is close to the metro, and easy to get around. Free street parking is an added perk! We look forward to future stays with them!","10"
"As a college student on spring break, my friends and I had such an amazing time and we absolutely loved the apartment. Tanguy and Uriel are very responsive and helpful with things to do and questions we asked, thoughtful of the space we stayed in and providing amenities we didn’t think of for our trip, and very sweet overall checking in and making sure everything is okay. Highly suggest staying with them if you’re thinking about Montréal!","10"
"The house was in a great location and the hosts were hospitable and catered to our needs. It was also very clean and stylish. I couldn’t have asked for a better stay","10"
"If you want an inexpensive place to stay outside of the city, this is an ideal Airbnb. We decided to Uber most days, but there is a train station nearby, as well as a grocery store and a Dominos. The space is comfortable and private, plus the host took the time to check in with us and recommend some great places. Would definitely recommend this Airbnb for small groups (ideally between 1-3 people: 1 bed and 2 sofa-beds).","10"
"Tanguy and Uriel’s space is so livable - everything from the location to the bathroom with the waterfall showerhead was great! Tanguy and Uriel themselves are also such warm people, always happy to offer recommendations and very quick to respond to messages. I’d highly recommend staying here!","10"
"We had a wonderful stay in Tanguy&Uriel’s place in Montreal. The apartment is located in a quiet neighbourhood just a few minutes walk from Frontenac metro station (green line takes you straightly to downtown). There is also a decent supermarket and great Polish bakery nearby - great to stop by on your way home from the city. The apartment was really clean, with fully equipped kitchen, comfy bed and nice bathroom. We also appreciated great sightseeing suggestions from the hosts - they are nice, welcoming and very responsive to the messages. I would totally recommend this place to everyone! Thank you for having us!","10"
"El departamento es increíble. Amplio, limpio, moderno, completo, acogedor. Excelente. La zona Es tranquila y tiene estacionamiento gratuito en los alrededores. Muy bien conectada por metro y bus con el centro de Montreal. Pero lo más importante es la anfitriona, fue Simplemente genial. Nos aconsejo, nos ayudó, estuvo atenta al clima y nos dejó paraguas en la puerta. Y lo más importante, cuando mi hija estuvo enferma nos ayudó a resolver el problema. No dudaría un minuto en volver a la casa de Tanguy. 100% recomendable. Gracias por tu hospitalidad!","10"
"Très bel appartement des personnes très accueillantes qui donnent de bons conseils et de bonnes adresses.","10"

"The space looks exactly like the photos on AirBnB. The space easily accommodated 4 people with 2 on the bed, and 2 pull-out futon couches. The hosts were very friendly, approachable, and knowledgeable of the area. Was pleasantly surprised when I checked in and saw bottles of water, snacks and candy on the table. Easy street parking and very close to many restaurants.","10"

"Wahouuuuu ! Quel bonheur de rentrer dans un logement propre, bien décoré et qui sent extrêmement bon!
L'appartement est situé à 650m du métro le plus près. Si vous avez une voiture, vous pouvez vous garer dans la rue, devant l'appartement, gratuitement.  L'appartement est situé au rdc, bien décoré, cosy et hyper bien équipé ! Machine à laver, cuisine équipée, bbq dans le jardin, excellente literie, Netflix, wifi et j'en passe...
Tanguy et Uriel sont des hôtes très sympathiques, et ne manqueront pas de vous donner de bonnes adresses. 
Plusieurs supermarché à proximité et fast-food.

"What lovely people and what a great place to stay! Montreal is a beautiful city, but can be hectic so it was great to walk into Tanguy and Uriel's place at the end of the day and feel comfortable. It had everything we needed and netflix was a bonus! We were able to park our car, but also were close enough to walk to public transport and a grocery store. We had a wonderful chat with them on the front lawn on the night of our arrival and it was actually a highlight of our stay. Would definitely recommend and would stay again :)","10"

"un très bon accueil, un super host, très francophone, ce qui est plaisant et intéressant dans ses explications sur le bon vivre de Montréal. 
Tout est présent dans l'appartement, l'emplacement est très correct, pas loin du métro, a budget raisonnable.","10"
"The apartment had all the amenities we needed for a pleasant stay. The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood with tons of character and charm! The easy street parking and proximity to the green line metro were a plus. Tanguy  and Uriel were very responsive and super helpful. They gave us great local recommendations and were around to answer any questions. We definitely will be back to visit Montréal soon!","10"
"Tanguy and Uriel’s place was prefect for our 4 day stay in Montreal.  They were so easy to get in touch with and offered suggestions for local activities as well as set up thoughtful extras like a pack and play and booster seat for our 1 year old.  Métro, park and grocery store are an easy walk and neighborhood is quiet with easy street parking.  We very much enjoyed our stay.","10"

Nous regrettons seulement la
 qualité des canapé lits pour dormir mais cela n'a pas changé ntre enthousiasme et la qualité de l'appartement et de l'accueil.

Really staying at Uriel's house was excellent. Firstly, we were greeted by the host who is always smiling and available. Tanguy and Uriel are wonderful people, thanks for everything !! As for the apartment, I just got compliments. It was all very comfortable, easy to park and the garden is an extra plus !!! The kids loved playing in the garden of the house. I can not forget to mention that the location is also very good. Anyway, it is really a five star ARBNB experience.","10"

"Logement design et agréable à vivre ! Quelques petites attentions sucrées et salées à notre arrivée ce qui est toujours appréciable. L'appartement est grand et très bien agencé. Arrivée et départ très simples. Nous avons dû annuler une nuit sur deux de prévues pour une question d'organisation et ils ont tout de suite accepté. Nous leur en sommes encore reconnaissants, c'est la définition d'être de bons hôtes. Très bien équipé, au calme. Peut être un peu éloigné des centre d'intérêts mais transports facilement accessibles. Nous recommandons !","10"
"Super accueil et visite de l’appartement, Tanguy reste disponible si vous avez des questions ! L’appart est bien, conforme aux photos, seuls petits bémols : la salle de bain n’était pas bien nettoyée et l’appartement n’est pas isolé donc nous été dérangée par le bruit venant du haut. Sinon nous avons passé un bon séjour à Montréal !","10"
"We loved our stay at Tanguy and Uriel's place. We were made to feel very welcome and appreciated the extra treats such as bottled water, crackers and lollies. The folder of suggestions and brochures were also very useful. We were travelling with our adult daughter and found the cottage to be very spacious. We were travelling without a  car, but found we could either catch the metro or walk to where we needed to go. I would not hesitate to recommend this place.","10"
"Super zuvorkommend und absolut zuverlaessig. kann ich wärmstens weiterempfehlen!","10"

Public transport is close and easy to figure out, Thanks for your hospitality!","10"
"logement fonctionnel et bien situé dans rue calme, mais sombre et assez mal insonorisé.","10"
"This is in a good location that is close to grocery stores and less than 10 mins from two Metro stations. On-street parking is available and it was easy to find a spot nearby. Tanguy and Uriel are very quick to respond and are helpful in giving suggestions for things to do while visiting the city. 

The mattress is quite firm so if you are used to a soft mattress, you may have an uncomfortable sleep.","10"
"J’ai été chaleureusement accueillie par tanguy et Uriel à mon arrivée.Ils sont très sympathiques et m’ont proposé les endroits types à visiter à Montréal. L’appartement est spacieux, bien décoré et très propre. J’ai eu un coup de cœur pour la salle de bain qui est top!!!

"Hôtes très serviables et réactifs.

"an amazing stay!! Tanguy & Uriel were amazing hosts and answer very quickly if/when we had questions/needed anything. the place is SO cute (id live there)!
has all amenities (dishes, pots, pans, utensils, towels, lining, extra pillows, everything). they suggest using the mattress in the closet for sleeping on the couches, and i agree! there are two futons + a bed. futons you always feel the pipe in the middle, w the mattresses’ you dont!

would recommend this place to anyone!!!!","10"
"Appartement design, moderne, très propre et très fonctionnel. Tous les équipements nécessaires sont présent ici. Le logement est d’une propreté irréprochable et proche des transports en commun et de supermarchés.
Tanguy et Uriel sont à l’écoute, à disposition, très réactifs et ont le sens du partage, ils ont été d’une grande aide depuis la réservation jusqu’à la fin de notre séjour. De jolies petites attentions à notre arrivée qui font plaisir et qui nous montrent que les hôtes aiment et savent recevoir en plus d’un accueil chaleureux, en personne et très souriant (ce qui rend le check-in facile et agréable). C’est un endroit idéal et calme que je réserverai de nouveau si je reviens à Montréal. Alors n’hésitez surtout pas à y séjourner.","10"
"Tanguy and Uriel were very nice people and great hosts. They made sure we were comfortable and offered many suggestions of things to do, but also gave us our space.

"Personne tres acceuillante rien a redire 
Gentillesse sourire serviable disponible 
Je recommande mille fois ","10"
"A great place, would definitely recommend. 
Conveniently close to transit and a grocery store, but far enough away from the city to be peaceful and relaxing. 
Noémie is a wonderful host, and is eager to share info on what to do in Montréal. 

A prodigious amount of pillows were also supplied.","10"
"Be aware: the room is cuter in real life than the photo. Such a pretty place. Couldn't ask for more. Thank you for everything !","10"
"Host was very welcoming and very friendly. The place was very accessible and very clean. Also the bedroom was unexpectedly huge! Host also provided lots of information and guidance. Overall the experience is very positive. I also had great night sleeps at her place!!","10"
"Noémie is an exceptionally dedicated host. She made us feel at home right away and asked several times if there was anything we needed. I told her it would be nice if we could sleep on separate beds, and when we arrived she had prepared an extra bed for us! We had access to all common spaces and amenities, and I have to say this apartment is SO charming and welcoming! The kitchen was my big favorite. The apartment is not in the center of town but very conveniently located: in a quiet residential area just 5 min away from a subway station and a supermarket. And also from that subway station is at the beginning of the gay village, on St Catherine street (the one with the rainbow), where there are many bars and restaurants. Noémie provided us with lots of tips about the surrounding areas. I just wish we had more time to hang out with her! Bottom line is: don't hesitate, this listing is what all Airbnb rentals should be like.","10"
"Very nice place and friendly host, close to downtown, tidy, clean and quiet","10"
"Noemie’s place was great. 
Very clean and comfortable.

"Noemie was a great host, very helpful with everything. Thank you for the warm hospitality!!!","10"
"Coming from NYC, I loved the laid back atmosphere of Montreal. The people where absolutely amazing on all levels. Starting with Alfredo. At first meeting, he was nice enough to come meet me at the subway station and walk with me to the apartment and tell me about the neighborhood. Alfredo was such a gracious host - from meeting me at the subway and giving me a tour of the neighborhood on the way to the apartment to making sure I felt welcomed and at home in his place - one of the best I've had. He had beautiful fresh flowers from the market around the house, some amazing yogurt in the fridge to start the day (have to find this back home) and even had a personalized map to welcome me to the neighborhood.  
The location is absolutely perfect. The apartment itself is nestled between some of the city's top rated restaurants and shops. The canal is situated right at the end of the block for the perfect after super stroll. There is a market about two blocks away that was just about perfect in every way. 
The neighborhood shops and their keepers really made it feel like a neighborhood - one that I wish I had had more time to spend in.
I would highly recommend this place and I'm hoping I can visit again soon. ","10"
"Great location and value. This condo exceeded our expectations. Alfredo was a great host, communication was nothing but smooth. I would highly recommend this place to anyone, the location is fantastic, Atwater market, great restaurants and bars all within a short walk.","10"
"Chez Alfredo est un excellent appart où rester lors d'un séjour à Montréal! Alfredo nous a accueillis chaleureusement et a maintenu un excellent contact avant et durant le séjour. L'appart est propre et très bien situé dans un coin jeune, dynamique, proche de tout. La cuisine est très bien équipée avec tous les petits électroménagers comme un grille-pain, mélangeur, cafetière, grille à sandwich etc. Salon propre avec télé câblée. En haut, il y a une salle de bain propre avec laveuse\sécheuse et le lit dans la chambre est très confortable! Quant au quartier, il est génial. Beaucoup de bars, bistros et cafés charmants, quartier jeune et vibrant avec beaucoup de patios en été. Une distance à pied du marché atwater et du Canal Lachine, deux excellents endroits pour une promenade ou être parmi les gens. Bref, j'y resterai à coup sûr lors des futures visites à Montréal!","10"
"One of the best Airbnb experiences we've ever had! Alfredo is an amazing host who embodies what Airbnb is all about. He greeted us at the place, insisted on helping us carry our big suitcases, left us wine and macaroons (!!) at the place and was so gracious and responsive our whole stay. The place was a complete delight. Clean, comfortable, centrally located right by AtWater and just 5 minutes from the Metro station. Lots of cool bars and restaurants right down stairs, even a natural store and pharmacy. The bed and shower were comfortable, enjoyed everything about this place! When we checked out Alfredo came to see us out, once again insisted on helping with the luggage and was fun to chat with for a few minutes until our Uber got there. We are Airbnb super hosts and feel like Alfredo inspired us to be even better by adding his own personal touch and lots of thought into his hosting. We recommend staying with him highly!!! Your Montreal experience will be amazing, you will feel just like a local with the comfort of home!! Thank you Alfredo! We will be back!","10"
"Alfredo's space was a great home base for us for our week in Montreal. It's a great location - we loved being by Atwater Market, and we ate at several of the restaurants in the area. It's also a fantastic spot if you want to get around by metro, since the station Lionel Groulx is on both the orange and the green lines, which was perfect for us (we used the metro a lot). Alfredo was a great host who was happy to answer our questions and I'd definitely recommend his place!","10"
"Alfredo is beyond a perfect and gracious host. He is attentive to detail and makes sure your stay is better than you could have hoped!! We will surely stay there again due to Alfredo, the apartment and the location. You could not ask for better. Why stay anywhere else!","10"
"I was in the city for a conference downtown and the place was perfect. I could hop on the metro around the corner and quickly get downtown, and then retreat into this sweet little neighborhood with great restaurants and cafes, the Atwater market just across the street, and take long runs up and down the canal or to the river.  Also a great public pool just down the street. Such a laid back vibe in the area!  The apartment is just as nice as in the photos and the stuff in the place is nice - crisp sheets, nice towels, good kitchenware, etc. Alfredo is a superhost who greeted me with an overview of the place and area, and made himself available if anything came up (which nothing did). I will definitely stay in this area if I return and @ Alfredo's if it's available.","10"
"My favourite air bnb to date. Alfredo was a fantastic host and very accommodating. He was there on arrival with everything we needed (including some macaroons and beer in the fridge!). Gorgeous apartment, very spacious and clean. The neighbourhood was fantastic with countless bars and restaurant and close to the canal, market and the metro. We walked into the city some days and took the metro others but either way, fabulous location without having to be too into the city to not have the pleasure of seeing the canal etc. Our flight time was changed last minute and Alfredo was very accommodating in allowing us to leave our luggage at the apartment. He was super quick in responding and catered to our every need. I can't recommend this listing enough. BOOK!","10"
"Absolutely brilliant flat, super clean, Alfredo is incredibly friendly and easy going, happy to answer all questions with a big genuine smile. Flat very well equipped, TV, Washing machine, great big shower room, very comfortable bed. 
Will definitely stay there again.","10"
"Alfredo is a great host and his apartment is in a great location. It's located in a lively street with several restaurants and Irish pubs and 5 mins walking from the supermarket, farmers market, and the canal. We'll definitely look for its availability next time we visit Montreal.","10"
"I had a wonderful stay at the unit hosted by Alfredo.  When I arrived at the unit, I let myself in with a key from a lock box and Alfredo arrived 30 minutes later to introduce himself and provide information about the unit.  He graciously supplied a case of water and a much appreciated bottle of craft Quebec beer.  

The unit itself is in a safe and thriving neighbourhood about a 5 minute walk from the Atwater Market.  The entrance to the unit is through a locked door at street level and up a flight of stairs to the front door.  Inside, the unit is very spacious and bright, with windows that face the street.  The living room and kitchen is on the first level and the bedroom, washroom and laundry facilities are on the second level.  

The unit is stylishly decorated and furbished, with a strong wifi signal throughout.  There is a long sofa facing a top class entertainment system which I didn't have time to use. The kitchen area is roomy and has a dining table.. Although I just made coffee in the mornings with the cream and ground coffee supplied by Alfredo, there are plates, cutlery and utensils for those planning to cook their own meals.

I had a comfortable sleep on the king sized bed and the black out shades kept the room completely dark when I slept in in the mornings.  The bathroom is well stocked with toiletries and the shower has excellent pressure with lots of hot water.  

All in all, the apartment completely met my expectations and I would certainly consider renting it again the next time I'm in Montreal.","10"
"Siamo stati bene, casa con ogni confort e in un punto strategico vicino ad ogni servizio. Consigliatissimo","10"

"Our stay at Alfredo’s place was amazing. 

The place is spacious, very clean, comfortable, decorated with good taste, and has everything one may need. I really liked his apartment. 

It is very well located, the restaurants and bars around are great and in an easy 30 minute walk you are downtown or in old Montreal. Very pleasant area to be outside and felt very safe. 

Alfredo always answered my messages within 5 minutes and was incredibly helpful and generous. 

I highly recommend this place. Thank you Alfredo!","10"

"Superb flat, beautifully decorated, super clean. Alfredo is very friendly and it was our second stay there and we will come back. Located so close to Lionel Groulx, very close to the canal that we can follow to town center (25 mn walk). 
 A perfect flat for a comfortable affordable stay. Alfredo had put coffee, a jar of jam and a beer in the fridge for us...","10"
"My third stay at Alfredo's, feels like home sweet home ! 
Lovely appartment, charming host... highly recommended for a nice stay in Montreal.","10"
"Great location for restaurants, Atwater market and Lachine Canal. The apartment on 2 levels is well set up for a couple but not all parents with small kids would be comfortable with the steep stairs. We liked it despite construction outside during our stay. Only criticism of the kitchen was the lack of microwave and lighting not as good as it could be. Same for the shower (lighting). We would come back i think.","10"
"It is the second time I stay here, I guess that says it all!
Thank you Alfredo for making it possible.","10"
"Alfredo’s wonderful space and convenient location is perfect for anyone staying in Little Burgundy. It is closely situated near the Atwater market and a great many shops and restaurants. The space itself is second only to Alfredo’s superb hospitality. In my case, he was tremendously accommodating in extending my stay. 
Thank you, again, Alfredo.","10"
"Alfredo was a great host. The location was perfect, the street had parking and lots of restaurants and shops. We loved our stay!","10"
"We appreciated the opportunity to stay at this stylish and spacious one-bedroom. The apartment is well appointed, with an attractive large window on the upper level. The location, beside many bars and restaurants and close to the Metro, is excellent. Alfredo was an attentive host and a flawless communicator. We hope to stay again.","10"
"This was the third time staying at Alfredo’s. Always wonderful. It was really cold out and the heating worked really well. All very clean and comfortable. Alfredo’s communication is swift, detailed and polite. He is friendly and welcoming. The area is nice, central but with a neighborhood feeling. I explored Atwater market this time and had a great time. Highly recommended. Overall everything was as expected, perfect. Would stay again? Yes! Thank you Alfredo","10"
"Highly recommended! Alfredo's place is beautiful, comfortable & homey. We were able to walk or take the Metro everywhere. The location was perfect as we were in town for a show at the Theatre Corona - a 3 minute walk away. I appreciated Alfredo's hospitality. He greeted us in person, arranged parking for us, and even had some local treats sitting out for us. The bed was so comfy! Great place to stay.","10"
"As always, Alfredo is a wonderfully accommodating host who truly has earned the moniker Superhost. 
When faced with a potential cancelled flight, Alfredo did not hesitate to suggest for me to stay an extra night. A tremendously accommodating offer!
Thank you, Alfredo.","10"
"This was my fourth time at Alfredo's. That says it all! Alfredo is a great host. The space is amazing, so close to some of the best restaurants in Montreal and to Atwater market where you can get anything from great cheese, bread, produce and fish. being so close to the 747 bus to the airport is perfect, 25 minutes to the airport for 10 dollars couldn't be better. All in all, I truly enjoyed staying there and I feel ""at home"" at Alfredo's! He always leaves a little present, this time it was a great bottle of wine. Grazie!","10"
"This is a great place to stay in Montreal. We were in town for a show at the Theatre Corona and Alfredo’s apt was less than two blocks away. The neighborhood has many great dining options within steps from  the apt, but also extending out a few blocks. There’s also some cute boutiques to check out.  TheOld Poet, Botanical Gardens and Mile End is a 15-20 minute drive, so getting around is easy. 
The apt itself was fantastic.  Sparkling clean, comfortable, lots of light,  nice towels, and a very comfortable bed. Alfredo was great to deal with before, during and after our stay. He was responsive, great at communicating, offered tips and recommendations and even left us some welcoming treats. We will definitely stay at Alfredo’s again. It was perfect for our needs!","10"

"Good home base for our trip.","10"
"Wonderful apartment in an interesting location--close to downtown. Alfredo was a thoughtful and helpful host and the apartment was perfect. Definitely recommend!","10"
"Awesome apartment in a great location, with great restaurants at your doorstep (check out Le Bon Vivant!).  Atwater Marche was right around the corner and the supermarket also a very close walk.

Great apartment with everything you would need - the fresh flowers in all the rooms were a beautiful touch!  Highly recommend for couples looking for a getaway in Montreal.  Thank you Alfredo for a wonderful stay!","10"
"6th time here. It was fantastic. This time I loved the Spring light coming in through the windows. The place is clean, comfortable, easy, functional and practical. I love the area. Alfredo is thoughtful, kind and generous.

Highly recommended.","10"
"The best kind of Airbnb experience. 

The apartment is lovely, spotless and a really homely place to stay. Alfredo has thought of all the little touches, and the location is perfect, with easy transport to/from airport and loads of great cafes, restaurants, markets and bars nearby. The Lachine Canal nearby is also great for running.

Alfredo makes everything simple. Check in and check out is easy and his communication throughout was great. 

Thank you Alfredo - you played a big part in our amazing holiday!","10"
"There are two key components to my review.  The first is Location, Location and Location.  You could not want for a better place to stay in Montreal.  Firstly, you’re barely five minutes from the Atwater Market to get all those amazing goodies for your meals (which we did!) and five minutes from one of the Metro station that will get you to most of the key sightseeing places in Montreal.  We didn’t use our rental car during our three day stay there.  On top of that, walk out the apartment door and whether you went left or right, there was an amazing selection of cafes to choose from.  

Secondly and most important is the apartment itself.  The apartment had everything you could want for your stay, a comfortable bed, great living area and so on.  Then add in the personal touches left by the host like fresh flowers, coffee, etc. and you can see why I can’t recommend Alfredo’s apartment highly enough.  I’ll certainly won’t hesitate staying there again should I return to Montreal in the future.","10"
"This flat is WAY better than the pictures show. It really felt like home away from home from the moment I'd walked in. First of all, Alfredo is a wonderful host. He was waiting for me at the flat even though I was running late due to traffic from the airport. A great welcome from him from the moment I walked in. The flat is actually quite large for a single traveller but would be perfect for a couple. Alfredo thought of everything: from a well-stocked kitchen to tons of towels in the bathroom, to cable TV, and even fresh cut flowers! The flat is located minutes away from TONS of bakeries, cafes and restaurants, not to mention the amazing Atwater market. AC definitely helpful during hot summer days. The flat is on two levels located above a pop up shop; so no noise issues from neighbours. However, it is located right on a busy street; so if you're a light sleeper, highly advisable to bring earplugs. Otherwise, a truly wonderful stay. Thank you Alfredo!","10"
"We had a wonderful time at this apartment. Alfredo exceeded our expectations. The location was perfect. We highly recommend staying here!","10"
"Alfredo was a great host and was very quick to respond. Many nice touches to make us feel welcome. Apartment was clean and had everything we needed. His apartment was exactly as advertised and actually turned out to be better than our expectations. Thanks again Alfredo","10"
"Alfredo’s place in Montreal is conveniently located to great restaurants and markets.  Alfredo was extremely responsive and his extra touches including complimentary wine and water made our stay extra special.  We would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal!","10"
"Alfredo's place is at a perfect location, very easy to get around with public transportation and walking distance to awesome bars and restaurants. His place is great,  clean and has everything you need. He is nice guy who was  helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it.","10"
"5-star accommodations, 7-star hospitality. ","10"
"Alfredo & his apartment far exceeded all expectations for our trip to Montreal. My husband and I initially booked with another host but after unforeseen circumstances arouse, I was left to look for another place to stay while on our way up to Montreal. I reached out to Alfredo and he dropped what he was doing to take us in and make sure that all was perfect for us! We walked in and we’re greeted with a cute sign welcoming us and with some Canadian wine. He showed us around and made us feel welcomed right from the start. He even gave us some fresh fruit that he had picked up at the market before we arrived. 
The location of his apartment is perfect! There are so many amazing restaurants and bars within walking distance. My favorite was the ice cream shop - La Diperie. The subway is also just five minutes away which was so convenient for getting into the city! The apartment itself was super clean and has everything you could need. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were so soft. Stop searching now and book with Alfredo! I definitely will the next time we are in Montreal. ","10"
"Alfredo is a Superhost. His unit is my home away from home. Very hospitable and has great attention to details. The unit is well maintained and has complete amenities. I would say that it exceeded my expectations. Thank you Alfredo for making my stay in Montreal a very relaxing and memorable visit. It was great meeting you.","10"
"As I have become accustomed to, Alfredo’s superior hospitality and convenient space have exceeded my expectations. Thank you again for accommodating my reservation (on such short notice). ","10"

"Great spot, in an exciting neighborhood.  Clean, comfortable and larger than expected. Alfredo's place is situated in a perfect area, with a pharmacy, supermarket, lots of restaurants, bars, Atwood market, the canal and the metro close by.  Don't pass this spot up.   ","10"

"Great as always
Can’t wait to be back
Wonderful place
Wonderful host!","10"
"Excellent apartment and Alfredo is a very helpful and considerate host.","10"
"The place is very comfortable and spacious; not fancy but the decor and layout really works and and is very comfortable, with many thoughtful touches.  The stairs were no problem for us and most people, but could be a challenge for someone with limited mobility. 
 We loved the location. Within a few blocks we went to the Atwater Market, which is great. The bakery accross the street is fantastic.  We liked brunch in the place next door and dinner at both restaurants within a block or two.
The metro is only a few blocks away and  the 35 bus going to the old town right in front.
We didn't meet Alfredo in person, but he was very prompt in communications and accommodating to our needs.
In Montreal, we really enjoyed Bota Bota and the light show at the Botanical Gardens.","10"
"Great location. Awesome host!  CLEAN and a great place to stay","10"
"Amazing location and great, clean and stylish place.  Great communication with the host. Recommend!","10"
"Far and away my new favorite Airbnb in Montreal. If you're coming for the food, like me, note this place is 4 minutes walk from Joe Beef and Liverpool House. if you enjoy a drink, some of Montreal's best are at Atwater Cocktail Club half a block away. In short, very centrally located. 

The place itself exceeded all expectations with a great bedroom, a nice living room and even a patio out back. Lots of fresh towels and the place was sparkling clean. 

would stay again in a heartbeat!","10"
"This is a lovely, comfortable, and spotlessly clean apartment in a great neighborhood. The location couldn’t be better...right near Atwater Market, close to the Metro with lots of great restaurants in walking distance. Alfredo is a very responsive host and will go out of his way to make your stay a good one.","10"
"As I have come to expect, Alfredo is a wonderful host and his place makes for a lovely and convenient stay in Little Burgundy","10"
"Great location and space. Conveniently located less than 5 min walk to Theatre Corona and Metro station. Plenty of restaurants, cafes, a pharmacy, liquor store and grocery near by. Would definitely recommend this place to others traveling to Montreal.","10"
"Alfredo was an amazing and very accommodating host and the place was fantastic. Super clean, very nicely decorated, warm and great location. Highly recommended.","10"
"I spent 5 days at Alfredo's place, a little longer than other times and had an amazing stay. It was clean and well prepared. His new bed cover is very pretty! I actually prepared a full meal this time and found everything I needed in the kitchen. It is so well located, the restaurants nearby are excellent. I was even able to take a 20 minute walk to go to the cinema. The apartment is cozy and welcoming. As always I recommended and would go back anytime to stay there.","10"
"Cozy apartment in a great location! Easy checkin and checkout, with good communication and thoughtful touches.","10"
"Modern light filled space to stay. Dine in with well equipped kitchen or eat out at one of numerous restaurants close by. The amazing atwater market is a block away beside a huge liquor store...never seen one with as much choice!","10"
"Alfredo is an amazing host. His place was spotless. The location was outstanding. Can’t ask for more in an Airbnb. Allowed for an early check-in and was very quick to respond to our questions. We will definitely be returning. Thank you Alfredo !","10"
"I love this place. Cozy and well located. It was very cold and was very happy with the heating system. 
Alfredo is an outstanding host.","10"
"Alfredo is consistently an attentive and warm host. His place is conveniently located in Montreal’s Little Burgundy very near to shopping, Aesop, dining, the Atwater market, etc. It’s a lovely spot to stay with a super-host!","10"

"Doris was extremely attentive and responded to our questions and needs quickly. Doris' home is extremely comfortable and beautifully decorated. It is in the lively Rue St. Hubert area with its great local restaurants and bars and is near the metro. We felt like we were living in Montreal style!

I would highly recommend a stay here if you are visiting Montreal.

"Really Nice loft. Exactly like the photos, plus Doris was fast replying. ","9"
"Ideal for family stays and Doris Mel's give quick response for any needs.","9"
"Had a great time in this appartment, everything was clean and beautiful. The hosts have great taste! Its very close to the Beaubien station so its very practical to go around town.
I definatelly recommend it!","9"
"We really enjoyed Doris's place!  The space is clean and bright.  The location is near shops and restaurants.  It was easy to get around here.  Doris was helpful and responsive.  We needed a few extra supplies and she was very quick to get them for us.  Parking was easy.  Checking in and out was no problem.  The space worked well for us.  We will look to stay here again.","9"
"The loft is perfect for a couple or two couples to spend a night or a week, or even longer.  The kitchen is equipped well enough to cook if necessary, and the washer/dryer in the unit was the perfect thing for us halfway through our trip to do a couple loads of laundry.  The bathroom is large and has a pleasant rain shower stall with a skylight in it.  Beds were comfy and clean, although it is a loft so be aware that there are no doors to the bedrooms, but they are large enough and located so that there is privacy.  The neighborhood is a mix of shops and some restaurants and bars, but was never loud at night.  The subway is a short two block covered walk away and gives you access to downtown in 10-15 minutes.  Overall, it is a great place for a couple to explore Montreal.","9"
"Very nice experience in this beautiful 2bed apartment. :)","9"
"good location, good facility, good for parking.","9"
"Overall, the loft was true to its description and photos.  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again next time we visit Montreal.","9"
"This is my dream house!l like it s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) much~~near metro ~l hope next could stay one week ~","9"
"Lovely spacious loft, nice location - walking distance to Little Italy. To get downtown or Old Montreal you need to take a metro though or drive. It is listed as having parking, however, parking is in the back alley on the parking lot of a store above which the loft is located. To get to the car you have to go around the block. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the maid who was  unsure about the parking situation. It did get sorted out quickly enough. The loft has a nice rooftop patio but we weren't able to use it since there is a constant noise from the store's big AC units located right next to the patio. Also, in the bathroom we had 4 little bottles of body lotion and 5 little bottles of conditioner, but no shampoo or body wash - we had to get our own. The host was a bit slow to respond, I was using SMS so maybe it's a problem with the app. Overall, we had a pleasant stay (3 nights).","9"
"The apartment was clean, accurate pics and a cute part of town.  Close to little Italy and near great restaurants and bars.  Doris Mel was easy to communicate with and responded promptly.","9"
"Great location with cool rooftop area. Lots of bars and restaurants in the area to enjoy :) round the corner to the metro which is very easy to use - 10mins to Montreal centre","9"
"Doris was very efficient and nice. She was very communicative, willing to help and answer any questions. The place was well provided, from kitchen utensils to laundry detergent. There are restaurants and shops right below the apartment. Most importantly, her furniture shop (which is very nice) is right under it. I recommend this place, it was a great stay.  ","9"
"Nice, very modeern place, very nice decoration, located in the middle of little Italy.","9"

"First time going to Montreal And glad we found Doris's airbnb. It was clean and comfortable staying. Also, it came with free overnight parking too! I would definitely stay at Doris's again if I go Montreal. Thanks!","9"

"Tout était très bien ! L'appartement est conforme aux photos et bien équipé. C'était très propre. L'emplacement pour la voiture est pratique ! Je recommande vivement ce Airbnb :)","9"
"A great place to stay, Very clean and in perfect conditions. Lovely apartment ","9"
"This is a very nice apartment in a fantastic location. The photos are accurate. It is quite clean and well appointed. There are not doors on bedrooms as it is a more modern layout, but this was no problem for us. It is maybe a minute walk to the subway. Petite Patrie might be the best neighborhood in all of Montreal.","9"
"Exactly as pictured with lots of natural light. The rain shower was really nice. The metro stop is right around the corner, but it's also walkable to mile end and the plateau. There are some nice restaurants and stores in plaza St. Hubert too. We loved staying here. ","9"
"Apartment was quaint with easy access to food, Bixi bikes, and shopping. Bonus parking spot in the back of the building, but  be cautious on the steep stairs in the front entrance. Doris Mel was super helpful especially when we had some hiccups in our check-in. Overall would recommend this spot if you're looking to stay in Little Italy. ","9"
"This was a great spot! True to the pictures with a nice, private deck off the back. Very close to the metro, but could also be walkable for those up for a bigger city trek (Mont Royal, old town, Olympic stadium - It takes some time, but it was a great way to see the city).
Lots of great restaurants in the neighbourhood as well.
FYI - there aren't currently curtains on the back windows, taking away from complete privacy, but there are spaces that provide that if needed (ex bathroom).
Doris was quick to respond and was flexible and understanding with arrival time - a great host!","9"
"Accommodation in the suite was very luxury and comfortable","9"
"We had a great stay. Check in was easy. Good for 2 couples. Great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and a short walk to the metro. Would stay again!","9"
"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans ce logement idéalement situé, lumineux et vaste.
Une petite remarque : des rideaux occultants seraient les bienvenus devant chaque fenêtre. Idem pour séparer la chambre du reste du couloir menant au séjour.
A noter l'accueil très chaleureux à notre arrivée comme à notre départ.","9"
"My friend and I really enjoyed staying at this AirBnB.  We rented the 2 bed unit. 
This was a very nice area to walk around, close to a fair amount of restaurants and public transportation.  Spacious unit itself, and nicely decorated.  Would recommend!  A note that those with mobility issues or heavy baggage may have problems with the stairs, as they are quite steep.  Otherwise, great spot!","9"
"The apartment has just everything ! it's well located (nice surrounding, close to the metro, variety of dining options and bar) and is well equipped. Definitely a good choice!","9"

"We loved our stay in Montreal. Great property in a convenient location!","9"
"The apartment is beautiful and just as pictured. The parking spot in the back is very convenient. The street is full of restaurants and a great coffee shop. I would definitely book this place again on my next trip to Montreal!","9"
"Lovely, clean and modern appartement. Nice patio in the back. Folks should know there are no doors on the 2 bedrooms....","9"
"Clean and comfortable.  Host very responsive.","9"
"The apartment was in a nice, lively location with lots of good bars and restaurants within walking distance. It was also very clean and in good order. I would recommend that she puts cover plates around all electrical outlets, both on the walls and ceilings (for obvious safety concerns). Also, it would have been nice to have doors on both of the bedrooms for privacy.  The location by far is the best part about this place. Doris was slow to communicate and disorganized in regards to pickup of the keys and parking location. An email or text would of been nice to have received a couple days prior to our stay in regards to instructions on where to pickup our keys and the free parking locations,  along with any relevant suggestions about the area. If she approves upon my noted concerns, I would highly recommend this apartment/condo.","9"
"Doris flat is cute , comfortable, with an amazing  wooden terrasse !!
2mn from orange subWay to downtown !!
Air conditionned in the flat : great !!
The street of the flat is well known with a lot of shops and cafes
Doris was not here but answers very fast to the mail 
We recommand heavily for a family stay","9"

"Nos gustó mucho el departamento de Doris: amplio, limpio, muy cómodo y con mucha luz. Perfectamente situado en Montreal y cerca de transporte público. No tuvimos problema para llegar en automóvil.
Sin duda regresaremos!","9"
"Awesome place! Really clean and full of wonderful furniture and decor. 

The street is also pretty quiet. Slept really comfortably and well! Really neat furniture store downstairs. Just our style. 

Easy to check in and out, no hassle.","9"
"The apartment is elegantly decorated and comfortable. It absolutely lives up to the pictures and description. A pleasant surprise for me was the surrounding neighborhood--plenty of charming shops and restaurants (some not so charming ones too of course) are steps away. It's a 5 minute walk to the subway stop which was so convenient for everything we wanted to do. Highly, highly recommend.","9"
"This place is worth. It has all the amenities as described. Additionally, it is close to downtown and most restaurants. The host needs to make it clear on where clean towels are located.","9"
"Great condo and we enjoyed our stay. The check in/out was easy as we picked up and dropped off keys to the store below. The condo did look like the pics but not exactly as lux and spacious as pictured. Also, be aware that there are no black out blinds (for people who like to sleep in complete darkness like me :( and the stairs are pretty steep and difficult to maneuver. We rented the condo for a girls getaway weekend and had a pretty rough time trying to get the luggage up and down the stairs! There is a TV, but no cable, so if you want to watch TV at all or play music, you will need to use your own Netflix account ( as we did). Overall, a pretty good value.","9"
"True to the pictures, the loft was spacious and clean with beautiful comfortable modern decor.  The outside area was a welcome bonus.  Check in and out was very simple via the staff in the furniture store below.  There is parking in the back of the store which was free, convenient and safe.  The neighborhood was active yet quiet, with many shops and restaurants lining the street. The host was friendly and responsive to any questions we had.  There are a few maintenance issues that need to be addressed (various outlet and electrical covers & a broken handle on the freezer) however, none of them interfered with our visit.  I would highly recommend this loft for your visit to Montreal.","9"
"The area is amazing, you are steps from everything you need. We ended up staying local on each of the nights there. Great Thai place across the street and lots of South American, French and Italian places around to choose from. Cool beer store down the street and a micro brewery you should definitely check out. The apartment is clean, well stocked and really nicely decorated. There is a cool terrace out the back and a really nice shower with a skylight. It is a bring your own bedroom door duration so just remember that if you want privacy. All in all a fantastic place, we would move there!","9"
"Nice place in a centrally located location. Be mindful if you have heavy bags or a stoller that the apartment has a steep staircase. Otherwise, a good place to stay when you're in Montreal and a 10--15 minute walk from Mile End.","9"
"Great location, lots of good restaurants/cafes within walking distance, as well as the Jean Talon Market. Apartment is clean and comfortable...and surprisingly quiet, considering the street below. I slept so well!","9"
"Wow, ce logement est impeccable!","9"
"Great location","9"
"We had a wonderful stay at Doris Mel's apartment! The location was on a very cute street with lots of stores and restaurants nearby and the metro (orange line) was right around the corner, which leads you straight downtown to Old Montreal! The apartment was clean with plenty of natural light. It was a great fit for a girls weekend away!","9"
"房子的位置很好,在一条商业街上的楼上,周围就有餐厅､面包房､小超市等等｡找门牌和钥匙的时候花了一些时间,之前一直没有找到位于门侧面墙上的密码箱｡房子的装修比较别致,但是有遗留的电线接头没有处理好｡总体比较干净,但是我们入住时发现卫生间垃圾桶里有遗留的垃圾没有倒掉｡有洗衣机,需要自备洗衣粉｡楼梯特别陡和窄小,有重件行李比较吃力｡车子可以免费停在后面｡总之,优缺点各备｡","9"
"Doris Mel's place is amazing, very clean, beautiful decor, large space as well. We enjoyed the back terrace, and it was surprisingly quiet inside eventhough the bedrooms are located adjacent to the main street. The location was perfect, lots of shops and restaurants nearby, including a grocery store and pharmacy. The stairs are a bit tight, its ok with small luggage, but it might be difficult with large suitcases,  otherwise the place was great, we enjoyed our stay and would go back for sure! Thanks!!","9"
"Let me first of all start by saying we would definitely stay here again.  It was clean, great location, FREE parking in the back (though the back is not easily accessible), the owner was very responsive, and the location was great.    A few things to mention would be that the bedrooms do not have doors so if you are needing privacy, you would have to be mindful of this.  Also,  the listing doesn't show the stairs leading from the main entrance.  What you see in the photos are the stairs in the rear that lead to the roof down below.  If you have difficulty climbing very steep stairs as we did (grandmother) then it's quite an inconvenience.  Though it would be fine otherwise.  

I did like the fact that it's close to a ""Jean Cotou"" store so you can get all your toiletries there.  It's 1 min walking distance along with other little stores and restaurants.  If your a coffee drinker,  ""Caffelinni"" is 3 mins away walking which we enjoyed.  Free parking (in the back) was a huge plus since parking in Montreal can get pricy.    That alone adds a lot of value to the overall cost of the place.  We were able to Uber when needed and drive to other places if we wanted without having to worry about garage fees.  

So overall, we were more than satisfied with the place and thankful to the owners for letting us stay there.","9"
"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great. Doris Mel responded quickly and made our experience smooth and easy. Although the stairs were a bit steep… her space is beautiful, spacious, and decorated as pictured… the washer/dryer and parking area were a plus! She’s a great host!","9"
"Super easy to communicate with host, good location - very walkable and close to subway, and nice, functional space.","9"

"Great place to stay!","9"
"Initially I was really pleased how responsive Doris Mel was when we booked the flat. She was very pleasant and she said she would be in touch closer to check in. I didn't hear from her so I followed up two days before and she told me that she would share the key code with me the day before. I didn't hear from her with the code. I sent her a message early the morning of check in and did not hear back, then I continued to message as we got closer, but still nothing. I read in reviews that she had a furniture shop as shown in the pictures so when we arrived I went into the store but she wasn't there. Someone at the shop knew the code for the key so we were able to self check in. I sent Doris Mel another message to ask where to park and she replied and apologized for a problem with the Airbnb app. I never received any information from her about the apartment, the key code, wifi password, check out, so we guessed our way through. The apartment is very spacious and nice but it had some quirks. The street the flat is located on is a hodge podge mix of shops and feels more urban than the rest of the area. I love Jean Talon and Little Italy so I was happy to be so close and the parking was a bonus but that was a little bit awkward too.","9"
"This is a modern luxurious flat just like the review claims. The location is on a vibrant and fun retail street (although the apartment is high up and completely quiet. ). There is a steep walk up the the apartment so if you have a disability this would be difficult.  The host like I think all Canadians was pleasant, patient, and nice.","9"
"We had a great time at the loft and truly wish we had another night there!! The space is modern, open, clean, with an exposed wooden wall on the back side. Very neat. There are no doors so it is a great place to hang out and float around with friends. It was close to good dinner options and also 5 minutes to the Beaubien stop on the orange line of the metro. The neighborhood is quirky and cute and definitely worth staying here! Thanks for the great stay!!","9"
"J'ai bien aimé le logement ainsi que son emplacement près de tous les services. Toutefois, on sent bien que personne n'habite ce logement et on a comme l'impression de se retrouver dans un appartement hôtel. Ce n'est pas très grave, mais, personnellement,  je suis moins fan. Les accessoires de cuisine ne sont pas de bonne qualité et on y trouve que l'essentiel. Sinon, le logement est bien décoré et le stationnement derrière est vraiment très pratique.","9"
"The place is really pretty and looks exactly like the picture. The only problem is the communication with the host. Better talk to the host before you arrive. The stairs to the top condo are a little hard for heavy cases. The location is good and the rooms are clean and comfortable to stay. In summary, it is a pretty good experience for me and my friends and we will recommend this place to other friends.","9"
"Very nice place as described on the pictures.  Could use a bit more kitchen utensils and basics like salt, pepper, sugar etc and some bed side lamps. 
We did miss having a little guide as we used to in our previous rentals for best places to go in the area for food, visits etc to get more of a local feel. 
Nonetheless we’ve had a lovely stay and although we didn’t meet Doris, she was very responsive at all times. We definitely recommend this place for its central location","9"
"What an amazing place and amazing location!

Photos are totally accurate, place is just awesome for the price. very spacious and my girlfriend and I had a wonderful time here while we stayed in Montreal for New Years.

Totally walking distance to everything and Right in the middle of the two best neighborhoods in Montreal!

Thank you guys!

"Doris is super responsive, and her place was very nice and in a great location.","9"
"Exactly as shown. Very clean. Spectacular neighbourhood, the strip was as if it was Christmas again. It was a bit difficult to find because the number isn’t visible on the front. Free parking but was hella hard to find it. The parking is located on the street prior to the actual street address.  Drove around atleast 3 times before we figured it out. At least 15-20 minutes away from downtown. If you have heavy suitcase or luggage, the stairs won’t be your best friend . You cannot, I repeat cannot enter from the back, so you have to park and walk around to the front. I would only suggest a mat at the front door for our shoes especially because it being winter, hand soap and hand towel to dry our hands would be nice. Overall my friends and I had a greet stay and would revisit. Montreal it was great, I shall return in warmer weather cause there’s so much I didn’t get to do.","9"

"It looks exactly like the pictures, very artistic  and rustic with a hint of industrial decorations. The aesthetics of this place is just perfect. Doris was very nice and patient with me since it was my first time renting an apartment and I had lots of questions lol. I'm glad with my experience with her.","9"
"Thanks for hosting us! We had such a beautiful visit to Montreal!! The apartment was safe, clean and quiet. It was easy to pick up & drop off keys. The area was cute. Lots of little shops around. It's above a store front and very close to grocery stores, restaurants & the metro. We bought a 3 day metro pass and found it very easy to jump on the subway to get downtown, to old Montreal and to Mont Royal. Our host was extremely quick at responding to any questions. The bedrooms have no doors. This was not a big issue for us in the end, but was a bit surprising. Can't wait to come back and visit again!!","9"
"Loft moderne, bien équipé et bien situé, tout à fait comme decrit.","9"
"Had great time! Mel was very responsive and helpful.","9"
"The apartment is very clean - I've stayed in 20+ Airbnbs and this was probably the cleanest. It is spacious without clutter. Although it would sleep and provide plenty of space for two couples, I found the single couch to be a limiting factor for comfort seating. We visited in March with temps in the 30's with our two year old - the apartment was plenty warm and very quiet. It's a short walk to the metro and bus - there is a great little grocer a couple doors down and an excellent bodega selling regional craft beer. Plentiful restaurants a short walk or metro ride away. It was a great ""neighborhood"" experience in Montreal.","9"
"Beautiful condo located on a busy shopping street, lots of great food options close by, the metro station is 3 minutes away.","9"
"Good place. Looks exactly like the pictures...just be advised, there aren’t any doors on the rooms except the bathroom.  So, if you want to be romantic with your spouse and you have company in the other room it’s a bit risky. Hahah

Aside from that, the touch of wood made it feel like home. Shops are just down the street and there is decent night life. A few bars good drinks and surprisingly not over priced.  Over all experience was good. She responds fast like she’s attached to the phone and is very helpful. Couldn’t ask for a better host.","9"
"Doris Mel’s place was perfect for our stay! It was clean, stylish, and comfortable. Doris Mel was quick to respond to questions about check in and check out which made the process super easy! The location was also ideal and there was so much to do right in the neighborhood. Would definitely recommend and stay again!","9"
"Exactement comme sur les photos","9"
"Really enjoyed our stay at this bright and cheery place. Beds were so comfy and lovely small restaurants very near by. So many to choose from!","9"
"Rien de négatif ! L’hôte répond très vite aux messages la place est exactement comme sur les photos. Manque de rien draps et oreillers en extra dans le condo même. Lits confortables et a quelques minutes du métro et du centre-ville. Vraiment génial !","9"
"Doris’ place is very clean, nicely appointed, has air conditioning (very important in the summer months) and a free parking spot.  Unfortunately when I was looking at the map, I didn’t notice how far away the condo is from downtown so we spent a lot more time on the metro than we’re used to.  We like to walk everywhere, but it wasn’t possible to walk to where we were spending our days (Old Port and downtown).  If you’re planning to spend more time by Jean Talon Marketplace and in Old Italy, this is a great place to stay.  Overall, we loved the condo and the fact that we didn’t have to worry about our car the whole time we were there, but the location was just to far away for us.","9"
"Overall, this is a good place and we had a nice stay. The space looks exactly like the photos, and it’s a perfectly sized apartment in my opinion. There are a few great bars and restaurants within blocks. Bed was comfortable. 

The main thing lacking was communication. The hosts never responded to my messages on Airbnb asking about check-in, all the way till the morning of our arrival. I texted both numbers listed in the House Manual and one of them finally answered hours before we got there. Doris was helpful and friendly over text but I wish there would’ve been better communication from the beginning and throughout our stay. On our last day, I asked about the details of checking out (wanting to know if we had to do anything specific before we left), but I never got an answer, so we just kind of guessed.

Other things to note: This is definitely more of a businesslike Airbnb, rather than someone’s actual home. I think they could use a fan in the bedroom. We weren’t sure if the towels or linens were 100% clean. The TV doesn’t have cable and you’d need to bring your own HDMI cord if you want to connect your computer to it. WiFi was good. Neighborhood is kind of a funny mish-mash of shops, but it has its charms. Parking spot was ideal.

If host communication improves, I would recommend this place!","9"
"Nice location, and easy access to downtown with the Metro nearby. Nice home.","9"
"The apartment is stylish and clean. The staff in the furniture store, which belongs to the same owner of the apartment, was very helpful in guiding us for the check-in.

We enjoyed very much our stay in the apartment.","9"
"Doris Mel's place was great, just as in the pictures. Very stylish and clean. I can't say enough good things about the neighborhood, we had so much fun exploring the area. It's also a quick walk to the metro station to get access to the other parts of the city. The parking behind the unit was a huge plus. We just parked the car and left it there for the duration of our stay (we were on a road trip.) Also the in-unit washer and dryer were huge for us because it allowed us to pack light. There's a full-sized supermarket a couple of blocks away where you can stock up on supplies. Thanks Doris Mel!","9"
"Beautiful loft, great location. Easy access to shopping, close parking space. Mel responded quickly to any question that I had. My family really enjoyed staying here. ","9"
"Doris' place is in a wonderful neighborhood. It is a roomy loft and it is steps away from some great restaurants and a few blocks away from the Metro.","9"
"Doris's place was extremely clean, nice and looked just like the pictures. Was in a good location and helped make our visit even more special. Thanks!","9"
"Fine place. Location is fun and you can walk to a bunch of other cool neighborhoods. Layout of the bedrooms without doors is very weird when staying there with 4 people.","9"
"Logement épuré et propre, très confortable et bien situé!","9"
"Mel's place was fabulous ! Super nicely decorated and confortable. It's in a vibrant street with lots of bar and dining options. Our family of 4 enjoyed it to the fullest. The parking spot was a plus for us!","9"
"Perfect location and truly beautiful home","9"
"Great place to stay!","9"
"The space is beautiful and comfortable and in the most fantastic neighborhood.  Would definitely stay again!
The space is lacking in some kitchen basics (salt, pepper, oil etc), but all can be accessed at nearby shops.
The A/C and parking was SO appreciated for our August stay.","9"
"Nice place Not so easy to find the entrance","9"
"You can't go wrong with Doris' place.  The neighborhood is fantastic, you're a short walk to the metro, and the apartment is very comfortable.  The air conditioning was a lifesaver, and since there are no doors on the bedrooms the air circulates well to cool the entire apartment.  For coffee drinkers, there's a Keurig coffeemaker but the closest stores don't carry the pods.  We found the pods at Marché Station 54 near the Rosemont metro.","9"
"Perfect location , nice appartment  well equipped  and easy to live in with an outdoor patio.
No doors inside make intimacy a little difficult .
Host very responsive  eventhough  not present .
Steep steps to access to the condo .
Definitively to be recommended","9"
"Doris's place is as it advertised. Very clean and walking distance to many shops and restaurants within couple of blocks. Highly recommended!","9"
"The apartment was very nice and clean. The unit itself was surprisingly quiet given how lively the area was. The location was great, and would definitely recommend this place for other travelers.

However, communication could've been better. We were not made aware that there were 2 lockboxes (1 for us, the other for the unit next door also rented out by the same host). We spent a lot of time trying to open up the wrong lockbox, as the other one was on a side wall which wasn't very noticeable (especially at night). Our calls/texts/messages to the host were not getting a response. The neighbors also came out to try and help us, and it took all 5 of us another 10 minutes of trying to reach the host before the neighbors noticed another lockbox on the side wall. This was the only time I've ever been frustrated with an Airbnb check in process.

I'd still recommend this place, as it was very nice and reasonably priced. However, I'd suggest that you get all of the detailed instructions from the host before the check-in date to avoid any issues.","9"
"Beautiful apartment in a very nice part of the city; great vibes from the neighbourhood! Tons of food places right in the market area hard to beat the location. The place was nice and clean and well stocked with extra pillows and blankets and towels. The shower was very nice and modern with a skylight which was nice. There is a very nice seating area out back that didn’t sound too great in the reviews but it’s actually a great space my friends and I enjoyed relaxing out back there","9"
"Great place. highly recommended.","9"
"Fantastic place. beautiful apartment. Just outside the centre (taxi to central) spacious. Really enjoyed our stay.","9"
"Beautiful apartment in a great location near everything. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.","9"

"Great location and space","9"
"非常好的房子","9"
"great location!","9"
"The loft is bright and airy. The furnishings are stylish and comfortable. Recomended.","9"
"This is a pretty cool place to stay but there are a few things that could be improved on and a few that should be mentioned. 

Some of the windows don’t have curtains and it’s a bit awkward after dark. There was no hand soap or hand towel in the bathroom, and there was only 3 towels for the 4 of us. There are also 35 narrow steps to haul your suitcases up, not a problem if you’re young and strong. This rental is a very open concept, with no doors on the bedrooms, and one open to the living room. 

On the plus side, it was super clean, the bed linens were crisp and clean, and the furniture was in excellent condition. Very stylish place!","9"
"Cute place!","9"
"Excellent rapport qualité prix. Logement tranquille.","9"
"L’appartement est très propre, les explications très clairs, quartier très calme, à 5minutes à peine de la station Papineau ! La décoration est magnifique ! Rien à dire
Très bonnes adresses à quelques rues de pizzeria ou brunch ( chez Régine  ) 
Merci à Doris Mel qui ont rendu ces quelques jours parfait","9"
"Stylish and accurately described. Our family stayed here for a one night visit. Great trendy neighbourhood with plenty of great restaurants and coffee shops. 
Thanks!","9"
"A cute and very, very clean little apartment a short walk from the Beaubien metro. Very clean and a great base for walks to Jean-Talon, Mile End, Plateau, Little Italy and other great areas. Would recommend! It may not work for those with accessibility requirements as the access is up a narrow stairway. Also, if you are planning to cook for yourself (we didn't) you should bring some basics with you. All in all, a lovely place for a short jaunt to Montreal!","9"
"Au coeur de la plaza Saint-Hubert un beau logement propre et bien décoré. Bon rapport qualité prix je recommande.","9"
"You will not regret staying at her place!  It’s well located and is beautiful!","9"
"Doris' place was beautifully furniture, close to the metro station and grocery store. Highly recommend Z Biztro (across the street) for great food and live music.","9"
"Bel appart! Très bien situé et très design, adorée mon séjour!","9"
"Doris' home is well located and convenient to public transportation. Her beautiful kitchen helped us feel like we were at a home away from home being able to have breakfast together.","9"
"Great location. We were able to Uber everywhere. Also the metro station is very close.  Everything was as described. The apartment is open, very nicely decorated. Bathroom is big, and the convenience of having a washer and drier. Parking is a plus.","9"
"Very clean and up to date. It was a pretty good stay because of that, but it was difficult to find the place and the parking in the back alley. It was also difficult to decipher what the host expected the place to look like or anything. There was no reassurance from the host whether or not everything was going ok. If you’re looking to have the least amount of communication and just a clean place to stay for the night, this is it for you. Unfortunately, it made our experience less of an experience because it was a trip for a group of us and we didn’t get any recommendations or anything from the host.","9"
"One of best place to stay in Montreal as everything is close by. All kind of shops and restaurants are close to the place. My recommendation to go for it.","9"
"The apartment is extremely clean, well designed, warm, and well maintained.  Additionally, communication with Doris was immaculate and I had no problems checking in or out.  I didn't give it a five stars because basics like soap or coffee that I generally have expected in many Airbnbs were missing for me.  Additionally, the extremely steep and narrow staircase was a little concerning, especially when walking in the dark.  Otherwise, highly recommended.","9"
"Lovely location and a stylish, roomy, sleek apartment. Terrific host!","9"
"Très propre et très jolie, bien situé j’ai adoré ","9"
"Decently located (not necessarily within walking distance) near mile end and other great parts of Montreal. It is super close to the metro which is very easy to navigate and really convenient for exploring the city. The apartment is really cool and well decorated, and the two queen size beds that  are really comfortable. There was no soap in the entire apartment, and also no hand towels, which was a minor inconvenience
But otherwise it’s a great spot, and I would recommend!","9"
"Had a wonderful stay in this conveniently located and well-decorated unit. The host was very quick to respond to all of our questions and needs, and the ability to have parking and being very close to key attractions (walking distance to the market and cute stores, as well as a quick Uber ride to downtown) made the stay extra enjoyable.","9"
"This place was great for my family of 4 people as it was cozy, comfortable, and clean! The entire suite is roomy and there are two separate rooms with two large beds (although there are no doors separating the spaces, so if you have snorers, you'll still hear it) and a nice living room area with a TV. Doris was very responsive to my texts whenever I had any questions and was wonderful to speak with! Just note that parking is just street parking, so you will have to pay out of pocket.","9"
"Great space and location.","9"
"Clean and stylish place that is open concept. Good place for a group of friends travelling. There is a nice coffee and dessert place across the street, a costume store (Dracolite) on the street and all the general amnesties you would need. The subway station is around the corner. The beds were comfortable! I enjoyed staying there!","9"
"Great location! Cozy stylish place with basic amenities.","9"
"Overall I enjoyed my stay, the only problem I had was with the front glass door being broken (you can reach the lock from outside because the glass is all broken which also means anyone can come in) and  glass was all over the front entrance. A big piece of glass was leaning against the lock which lead to me cutting my finger...besides that it was a nice place to stay in.","9"
"L'appartement était propre et agréable.","9"
"Great stay. Overall a great value. Only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5: the parking was very far from entrance, we had to walk down a back alley at night with the road completely iced over with our luggage and there were no doors on the two rooms so do not expect great privacy. But a great launching pad in Montreal and beautiful decor!","9"
"all good","9"
"When we arrived at the apartment we discovered that there was no key in the lock box. Multiple calls, texts, and messages to the host were not answered. After an hour of attempting to contact the host, who had left the key in the wrong lock box, we finally left and got a hotel. If the host had answered the phone and given us the code to the lock box containing the key everything would have been fine. When I attempted to call the host the next morning she hung up on me and all subsequent calls went directly to voice mail. RENT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!","9"
"Beautiful home and everything was absolutely perfect! Thanks for the great hospitality! :)","9"
"Le logement est magnifique, très chaleureusement meuble, On se sent comme à la (Website hidden by Airbnb) rue Saint Hubert est animée et très bien située. On recommande cette adresse.","9"

"Great place ,very clean ","10"
"I selected this apartment for location and value, and I was quite pleased. From this location we didn't even use the car. We just rode our bicycles everywhere. The bike trail is not far, and it took us to Old Montreal and beyond. The second bed in the apartment is a pull-out couch, which was comfortable enough for our short stay. We were there during a heat wave, and we noticed with the bedroom door closed the bedroom was stuffy, but that was solved the next night by leaving the door open. I opted to park curbside and received a parking fine, not realizing it was illegal there. Next time I would pay to park in the garage. Overall, we were quite happy with the apartment, and Carole was very responsive and helpful.","10"
"Appartement très propre et idéalement situé. Nous avons tous fait à pied mais vous avez la possibilité de prendre le métro à 5 Minutes à pied","10"
"Spacious and comfortable apartment well located. We had a good time :)","10"
"The apartment was in a location that was easily accessible from an airport shuttle stop.  It was also close to many restaurants and coffee shops. 
The apartment itself has just the basic amenities.  It appears no one lives there when it's not inhabited by short term (Airbnb) renters, and that means that there were some things missing that someone living in a place might have been able to offer (i.e., a hairdryer).  Getting into the apartment was a breeze with the no-key entry.  Carole was nice although I didn't meet her in person.  She was  available via text- for the most part.  We had a nice, one night stay in Montreal at Carole's place. :)","10"
"Fantastic room that was located in a great area. Close to public transportation and to downtown Montreal. Very clean and spacious. Would recommend :)","10"
"Carole's place was great - so close to downtown and old Montreal with tons of shops and restaurants. Her place is well equipped and very comfortable.","10"
"Carole's place is clean, simple, and tucked quietly away from the main hustle and bustle of Montreal--exactly what we were looking for in our short stay.  Carole is easy and efficient to communicate with.  We appreciated her quick responses to adapt to our changing circumstances prior to arrival.  ","10"
"Carole was easy to reach and very accommodating and let us check in early! The space was well cleaned and accurate to the posting. The only down side being that the laundry service costs $4 to use and the wifi was spotty. Overall a good stay and would recommend to my friends.","10"
"Un grand merci à Carole pour son accueil et sa disponibilité l'appartement est très agréable, propre et calme, parfaitement situé près du centre et des transports en commun pour profiter de Montréal ça donne envie d'y revenir.","10"
"Easy to communicate with. Was very flexible upon check in. Great location. Highly recommended","10"
"Carole's place was really conveniently located in the downtown area, close to bus and metro stops. We enjoyed using the pool a few times. Check in and out were very straightforward. Thanks Carole. ","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"

"Great place. Walkable! Quick communication with host!","10"
"Carole's place had everything we needed! It was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. The location was amazing, as it was a very short walk to both Saint Catherine St. and downtown while also being tucked away from busy traffic. It's the perfect place to make you feel safe and at home!","10"
"O apartamento foi perfeito. Possuia tudo o que necessitamos. Muito limpo e cheiroso.  Perto dos meios de transporte e da estação central. Recomendo sua locação.","10"
"Great location, clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. A lovely place with almost everything you need, including a little balcony if you like getting some fresh air. The WiFi signal was kinda weak in the bedroom and there was no TV in the living room, but overall, it was a very pleasant stay. 10/10 would recommend.","10"
"Great host, quick reply and very helpful. Great location if going to Bell Center!! Would book again!","10"
"O apartamento de Carole é muito confortável e bem equipado, além de bem localizado. Nós o encontramos muito limpo. Um dos melhores lugares em que me hospedei pelo Airbnb.","10"
"Great location 

Close to food, pharmacy and metro.

Avoid walking around at night solo if ur a girl there was some issues with the locals catcalling us. 

Other than that we would defiantly
Stay again","10"
"Sarah's place is a nice little apartment in a really great location downtown. It is really close to the Metro station which was very handy. It was really hot when we travelled which the air conditioner wasn't able to compete with therefore the apartment was quite hot. The WiFi also doesn't work very well. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it.","10"
"Parking on site for a fee but necessary in such a busy city. It is below the high rise apartment building and a little confusing at first. You have to walk out the drive in ramp when you arrive since you won't have the code card yet to scan. After that it's easy in and out. Little extras in the apartment make you (Email hidden by Airbnb) fortable and clean. Our first Airbnb and a good experience.  We walked everywhere but the public transportation would get you there too.","10"
"Sarah's place is amazing! Super close to everything we needed and we were able to find parking close by. The communication with Sarah was super easy and once we arrive to the apartment it surprised me how clean and nice it was. She provided us with everything we need (or may need) for our stay. I totally recommend it and I would love to stay there next time I go back to Montreal.","10"
"Sarah est super  disponible. Appartement propre et spacieux.","10"
"El apartamento de Sarah es mas amplio de lo que se ve en las fotos. Fácil acceso al metro, se puede llegar caminando a 3 diferentes estaciones. Muy limpio y ordenado. Un supermercado y varios restaurantes cerca. Sarah es una excelente anfitriona, de fácil comunicación y pendiente de cualquier cuestión. Un plus es que hay artículos de aseo en el baño y botellas de agua disponibles, ademas de suficientes toallas para la estancia.","10"
"Sarah's place was excellent. She communicated with me to ensure our stay was pleasant and we had everything we needed. 

Very clean, walkable to down town Montreal, and a stones throw from lots of restaurants and city life. Highly recommended to anyone looking for reasonably priced accommodation in Montreal.","10"

"I recommend this place without second thoughts. Everything I needed was available. It is a very cozy place, clean and it felt like my own. The location is perfect as I used to live in Montreal for 13 years and went to Concordia university. It is close to all kind of fun entertaining places, close to metro, and it is a safe area.","10"
"This apartment was everything we needed. It was a short walk to  all the downtown stores, restaurants,  and bars.  It was great to have a full kitchen and a balcony to catch some sun and fresh air.

"Sarah’s place was great. She kept in touch before and during our stay and checking in was super easy. The apartment was really clean and had everything you could need. Plenty of space and a very good shower!

It was in a great location close to Lucien L’Allier and Guy Concordia Métro stations and just around the corner from the 747 airport bus stop. Despite being next to a busy highway and a fairly busy railway line, there were no issues with noise at all (thanks to the good windows). Only 5mins walk to St Catherine Street and max 20min walk to downtown. 

If I’m back in Montréal I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again!","10"

"Stayed at Sarah's on a brief 2 day trip to see a concert at the Bell Center.  Fantastic location,  just a 10 minute walk away.  Also walking distance to great restaurants and pubs.  The space was clean, bright and airy.  Everything worked including the AC.  Beds are comfortable and linens clean and fresh.  Great shower.  Lots of space including a balcony.  Quiet building too.  Would recommend this place and this host in a heartbeat.   Hopefully I will get to stay here again.  Thanks Sarah.","10"
"I rented this place for my son to take his 13 year old daughter for her birthday to Montreal.  He sent me a text to say the place was excellent - the location couldn't be better, the availability of parking within the building helped a great deal and was not expensive - the food in the breakfast buffet worked well and he just found it overall excellent - and very clean.  Thanks to the hosts.","10"
"Sarah was a saviour. We had our original booking get cancelled very close to our trip date. Sarah was very responsive and helpful with coming to our rescue. We then experienced another uproar with airbnb themselves, and Sarah had our back the entire time. I am very thankful for what she did and provided us with during our stay. We walked to Old Montreal, all through St Catherine. And everything was close if you didn't mind the walk. Being 10mins from the Bell Centre, which was our main reason for our trip, was amazing. We felt very safe during our stay, and would highly recommend this space. And will most definitely check for availability my next trip ","10"

"Sarah’s house is in a perfect location; the bus from the airport drops you 3 minutes walking from the house, you have 2 different subway stations to choose from within 7 minutes walking from the house and it’s a nice, short walk to get downtown!
Although we never met Sarah, she answered right away to all of our questions, both house-related and not, such as where we could find supermarkets late t night!
The flat is very spacious and provided with everything you might need both for short-term and long-term stays: plenty of towels, soap, shampoos and conditioners, pans and pots, coffee maker, hair dryer...
We absolutely loved the house and it helped us enjoy our 5-day stay once Montreal even more!","10"

"My boyfriend and I had a delightful stay at Jade's cozy apartment.  Jade met us at her apartment and provided us with a helpful itinerary and advice on what to do and where to go.  She generously gave us a quick walk through of where to find things and even provided us with complimentary coffee, teas, and chocolate. The apartment itself had so much natural light and had a cute patio where we enjoyed breakfast in the mornings.  It was situated in a great location close to cute bars and restaurants.  Thank you for the stay Jade, hope to be back in the future!","10"
"Jade was an amazing host who helps you out in every way. She keeps in close contact with speedy responses and her apartment was great! I would stay there again in a heart beat.","10"
"We'd be delighted to return to Jade's beautiful and bright apartment! It looks just as pictured in the photos. There were lots of stairs to get up to it but it's a great space with nice views, perfectly located near the plateau, McGill University and Place des Arts. The apartment was well equipped. The bed was comfortable and the WIFI was fast and efficient. It is a great find in a super location!","10"
"Jade's apartment is just as charming as it seems in the photos, and she is so communicative and helpful. She even left us a two page, hand written guide of things to do, see, and eat in Montreal. 

Her kitchen has everything you'd need to cook (go to Jean Talon Market for the freshest produce imaginable, and excellent cheese). Her street is lovely and convenient.  Just a few blocks from Juliette et Chocolat on St Laurent, where you can get the very best dark hot chocolate ever. Shirt walk to several busses and a metro, and a slightly longer walk to Mont Royal park, the Quartier Des Spectacles, and to the McCord and Beaux Arts museums. 

The bed is comfortable. The balcony is perfect for morning coffee (though we never ended up sitting out there because we had breakfast out every day). The neighborhood seemed really quiet while the students were gone, though got louder the last night we were there as the school year seemed to have started again.

I would absolutely stay here again.","10"
"Un Grand Merci pour votre sympathique accueil ! Quartier parfait tant par son calme que par sa facilité d accès à tout Montréal. En 5 à 10 mn en bus ou en métro on peut visiter toutes les facettes de cette ville très vivante ! A recommander pour des week-ends romantiques ou culturels ! Grand loft où la lumière est le maître mot avec vue imprenable sur le Mont Royal du beau à chaque saison. Tout simplement MERCI","10"

"Laurel's loft is indeed magical. I loved every minute of my stay there. Comfy sleeping area; comfy desk and chair for working; beautiful view of the backyard garden through a big window; skylight to gently wake you in the morning; nice, clean bathroom; kitchen with two stove tops (no oven) where one can do decent cooking--- it was all that I was looking for. The loft is quite compact but very functional and beautiful, it worked perfectly for me. PLUS the location - Duluth Avenue, St. Denis Street, La Fontaine Park, Mont Royal Park, etc, are all steps away or within easy reach. PLUS the host - Laurel was so thoughtful, responsive, helpful, and kind. I recommend this place with no hesitation.","10"
"I loved staying here. It's super cozy and the location is fantastic, just one street away from a bunch of bars and restaurants!
Laurel, even though I didn't get to meet her face to face, was highly available, accommodating and very friendly.

Keep in mind this place is tiny!! I do not recommend it for people who like to hang out in the appartment too much. I would highly recommend it for people like me who spend most of there time out and about and just need a nice cosy place to lay there head down for the night.

If I go back to Montreal I hope to stay there again.

","10"
"Cosy and quiet little place! Laurel was flexible with the checkin time and responsive when having questions. The location is fantastic, close to cafés, restaurants and shops, ten minute walk to metro Mt Royal.","10"

"We absolutely loved Laurel's space! It is homey, clean, well-decorated, and had everything we needed and more for our stay. The location is great and Laurel was a very communicative and accommodating host. We would love to stay here again. She also recommended some wonderful spots to check out during our stay - so make sure to check those out! This was definitely one of our best vacation accommodations ever.","10"

"Laurel's place is great! She's very responsive, and the place is convenient, located near restaurants/bar/supermarkets/metro and in a cool area.
I much recommend this place!","10"
"This was a great spot!  I arrived late, so the lockbox made check-in really easy.  The location was ideal; I walked everywhere and only took the Metro/bus to and from the airport, plus the neighborhood is adorable with lots of cute houses and fun murals nearby, as well as tons of restaurants and bars.","10"
"Very nice place, everything was perfect","10"
"A very sweet little spot, well located and private. Check-in is very flexible and Laurel always responded promptly to communications. A great spot for a weekend getaway.","10"
"Lovely paradise close to everything !!!
Laurel will receive you in this hidden tiny loft, in a quiet street next to everything around.","10"

"The hobbit loft is a cute quirky place and finds itself in a fantastic location for all things Plateau. You won't find better self contained value than this.","10"
"Location!! Great for walking and close to Metro.
Close to many great restaurants for evening dining and morning walks for pâtisserie and café.
Laurel is an excellent host and responds quickly to messages.
There was a small issue that Laurel addressed immediately and resolved very generously.  
I would recommend this accommodation ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","10"
"Laural was super nice and helpful. She went out of her way to make delayed baggage arrive at the flat late at night (~ 1 am) as I didn't have a local phone number. This was super helpful. Only drawback was the loud fridge which got better once I place some paper towels on top. Otherwise I slept like a baby. The place is cute and nicely located and has everything you need. I would def come again. Thanks!","10"
"Great location in the Plateau, cozy and peaceful space.  Good place to stay in Montreal!","10"
"Excellent location. Easy and flexible check in and check out process and time.","10"
"I had a nice time at Laurels place! It is indeed a small hobbit loft, cosy and well equiped, just the fridge was a bit noisy and in summertime it can get really hot upstairs. I recommend this apartement for a short trip! Laurel was really easy with Check in and check out and welcoming! Thanks!","10"
"L’appartement de Laurel est identique aux photos. Il est d’une propreté irréprochable. Laurel a été très disponible pour répondre à mes questions. L’appartement est bien situé, à quelques stations du centre. J’ai vraiment apprécié ce séjour à Montréal ! Merci Laurel","10"
"The best choice I could have made for my first days in Montreal! Laurel was the best hostess and Hobbit's place the best airbnb ever! The location is perfect, the apartment is magical, inspiring, full of loving details. Many trees around and a ceiling where you can sleep looking at the moon and talking to the stars. Laurel was really nice and helped me a lot. Everything was clean and a lovely welcome message with some coffee were waiting for my arrival. Thank you for opening your home for me! It was really special.","10"

"Great stay in Montreal! Davide was great at communicating details and answering any questions I had. The place was exactly as described and was perfect for our group's stay.","9"
"We had a wonderful stay at Davide's house. The house is located in a beautiful area of Montreal, and walking distance to a bunch of trendy shops and restaurants. The house was very clean and we were offered everything we needed (laundry, kitchen stuff, coffee, towels, etc). Our favorite part was sitting outside to eat breakfast in the private backyard. Athena, the cat, was sweet, quiet and easy to take care of. 

Davide had great recommendations, was very communicative and accommodated an early check in for us. I would highly recommend this airbnb for anyone looking to stay in a fun, non-touristy part of Montreal.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Davide and Pierre's home offers great style, location and value! It looks even better than the photos, because the kitchen and downstairs have been recently renovated. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants to experience living in a neighborhood setting. However, please keep in mind that the home isn't air-conditioned, and that it's located next door to a charming BYOB restaurant. The latter has outdoor seating in the back in the warm weather months, so there is some outside noise until about 11 or so on weeknights and until about midnight on Saturday. ","9"
"Davide went above and beyond. Left information about local spots and how to access them. Amazing and hope we can stay again. Thanks again Davide.","9"
"Séjour très agréble chez Davide. Tous étais propre et conforme aux déscriptions. Très bon emplacement à distance cyclable ou à pieds des quartiers animés. Merci.","9"
"Davide’s house is lovely and is in a beautiful and lively location. It has a cosy backyard  where you can spend special evenings in the summer. The house has a cool decoration and everything is handy in the kitchen. 
The only thing we were not satisfied about the house, although we knew the owners live there, is that we thought we were not given enough space to place our personal belongings in the kitchen and bedroom. And the owners didn’t go the exta mile to make us feel welcomed like the other houses we stayed in this trip. 
Overrall a good stay. 

","9"
"Davide est une  personne , très réactive, qui a su répondre a toutes nos questions , arrivé sur place nous n'étions vraiment pas déçu, le logement est impeccable , spacieux et bien équipé ,il est idéalement bien placé ( boulangerie , ligne de bus , dépanneur sont à proximité ) . De plus le plateau est un quartier très animé .
Nous reviendrons un été ... ","9"
"Wonderful condo in an excellent location. Carlos was incredibly hospitable and friendly! Thanks for the lovely stay!","10"
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for Memorial weekend and the place was very convient to the center of town, the metro, restaurants and shopping. The apartment was modern and quiet and the underground parking was a huge plus! Carlos was pleasant and responsive to any questions we had and we would highly recommend his place to anyone traveling to Montreal. ","10"
"Everything was great! Carlos is very nice. The place was well stocked, in a good location, and a good size!","10"
"Superbe place! Very clean and easy access. Carlos was fantastic with accomodating us with 2 parking spots. Although we were 2 couples, good thing we brought a throw cover and pillows for the pull out because their were none other than that fantastic. We would definitely rebook with Carlos. ","10"

I enjoyed my stay here and definitely look forward to stay in the future.
Thanks Carlos for the excellent hospitality extended to us.","10"
"Das Apartment von Carlos liegt in Gehdistanz zu Downtown Montréal und ist damit idealer Ausgangspunkt für die Besichtigung der Stadt. Es ist neuwertig und verfügt über alle Annehmlichkeiten, die ein Tourist braucht. Trotz der zentralen Lage verbringt man die Nacht dank moderner Bauweise sehr ruhig. Das Waschen unserer Kleider war problemlos möglich.","10"

"Carlos was a great host who was very flexible and incredibly easy to communicate with. We had a great time and would recommend the spot to anyone looking for a few days in a great part of the city!","10"
"I exspecially enjoyed the cleanliness and the excellent quality of the entire décor, the functionality of the items, the studio apartment is really cozy cheap compared to the offer of hotels and residences in montréal. If you have special space requirements, it is best to point to a two-room apartment, here the bed, although separate from the living room/kitchenette, is visible. My review is great, i would recommend it, even for a stay longer than two weeks that i and my husband spent there.","10"
"Perfect place.

The unit is new, clean and everything works perfectly. The location is excellent, downtown (close to Guy Concordia subway station on the green line and to Lucien L'Allier on the orange line) and at less than 5 minutes on foot to St-Catherine Street. 

I loved my time there and I would recommend it to anyone.","10"
"Very clean apartment. Carlos met me to hand the keys and explain everything. It si difficult to find better location.","10"
"Très belle localisation et très propre. Carlos répond promptement aux demandes. Nous le recommandons.","10"
"My husband and I really enjoyed ourselves in Montreal. The location was perfect for us and it was easy to walk to many restaurants and shopping. The condo is beautiful and very clean.

L'appartement est propre, l'accès à la cusine sans aucun problème, rentrée dans l'appartement a l'heure flexible est très pratique. Le prix est équivalent au qualité donnée.

"Very nice host, quick response","9"
"The host was argumentative when I told her there were no drinking glasses in the kitchen. She expected me to use one of the tiny little expresso cups. There were a sink full of dirty dishes from the time I got there until the time I left. We found a dead mouse on the kitchen counter one day. The bathroom sink was disgusting when I got there but cleaned, but not well, a couple days later. The outside door was not just unlocked but open when I got there because it was broken. It was fixed a couple days later. There were new windows being put in the week I was there. She failed to tell me that until after I was there. The workmen were there too early in the morning for me and made a lot of noise which effected my sleep. You needed to take a long bus ride to get to the grocery store. Luckily, there was a well stocked variety store just minutes away.","9"
"Although I did not meet her my first day, Caroline was very helpful  and provided very clear and straightforward instructions for checking-in. She was also very quick to answer any questions I had via text. The room is simple, warm, and looks just like the photo. Location is convenient as the bus towards downtown Montreal runs on the same street. I would not hesitate to book again.","9"

"Great deal for travellers looking for a place to rest.

It is in the suburbs. Accessible by public transit via Metro and then the 189-E Bus from the Honoré-Beaugrand station. Which drops you 1 block from Apt. also take the 189-O bus to the metro from George V road. 
Convenience store within 1 block of apartment for essentials. 
Subway, indian and Vietnamese restaurants about 1 mile walk.
I had cool roommates during my stay so hopefully you will too.

"Situé à une trentaine de mètres du merveilleux parc Bellerive, cet appartement reste un espace idéal pour celles et ceux qui n'aiment pas le bruit. La tranquillité est frappante. Le confort du lit ne passe pas inaperçu, plutôt remarquable. La cuisine est en libre service....
Un petit bémol tout de même, la propreté des espaces en commun dépend des différents colocataires...(cuisine, salle de bains).
Ne vivant pas elle-même dans cet appartement, Caroline est très réactive à tout mel, message... Et comment faire fi de sa sympathie et surtout de son souci de s'assurer de votre bien-être? Impossible.
Je la recommande vivement à tou.te.s

"Rafael was very nice, and easy to communicate with! He also had very good advices on what to see, what to do! 
The apartment was absolutely perfect!! The location was great, close to everything and 10 minutes walking to the Mont Royal metro station. 5 minutes away from the Mont Royal avenue and 10minutes away from Berri UQAM. 
It is across from the Parc Lafontaine which is one of the nicest parc, especially on a sunny day! We had a great stay and we will definitely come back and stay at his apartment if possible! Thank you Rafael! ","10"
"Foi tudo muito perfeito! O Rafa é uma pessoa espetacular, de muito fácil acesso e sempre muito respectivo com qualquer dúvida. A experiência foi ótima, a localização do apartamento é perfeita, próximo de bons restaurantes, uma praça bem agradável para caminhar e andar de bicicleta. O estúdio é bem agradável e de fácil acesso por transporte público. Recomendo a todos no Airbnb. ","10"
"We had a good stay at Rafael's. He is very easy to communicate with as his co host. They provided us with everything we needed to enjoy our stay. I would recommend staying at Rafael's.","10"
"Overall this is a great place to stay! The hardest part was trying to figure out where to park. It's easier to find a spot on the weekends, but I don't know where we would have parked if it was a weekday. Once we were settled though, my husband and I loved the apartment! We were able to cook there and it was a good size for 2 people. There is a big park right across the street that was nice to walk in and if you want to, you could walk to downtown and save the hassle of driving. Rafael was also a great host and was very quick about responding to questions we had! He also left some snacks out for us and made staying there easy. I would highly recommend if you're looking for an affordable place to spend the night and tour the city during the day.","10"
"The location was great and everything was just as described--if not better. Raphael was a great communicator as well and very helpful in making adjustments. I strongly recommend his place for the location, value and great host!","10"

"Rafael made the whole process very easy. Communication was superb. This location is great. We were lucky to find a parking spot right in front of the building  so it turned out to be a great deal.","10"

"This place was central and walkable to pretty much everything. Great value for money & perfect size for just me, but the futon couch was great for when my friend stayed over one of the nights. It's right across from Parc Fontaine & a nice  walk to Mont-Royal. Rafael was very prompt with all communication including detailed instructions for self check in. Would recommend to any of my friends & would definitely stay there again if possible.","10"
"Rafael was an excellent host. Though we did not meet him, he was excellent at communicating with us and he made check-in very easy.

I went for long walks.There are lots of nice restaurants in the area. Also close to buses and metro.  The room and bathroom are spacious and listing was accurate","10"
"Shereen's place is the ideal spot for experiencing Montreal.  The apartment is immaculate with easy access to two metro stops, the Atwater market, the canal, and a Bixi bike hub around the corner.  Her recommendations are perfect for enjoying the city and nice additions like netflix access, the gym, and on-street parking make the apartment a top-notch experience.","10"
"Shereen's place is beautiful!  Sparkling clean, beautifully decorated, and the rooftop terrace was incredible.  The apartment is in a great location--a quiet, peaceful street, but a quick walk to great restaurants, shops, and the metro.  Checking in and out was super easy.  Shereen was communicative, really friendly, and had great recommendations.  Stay here, it's wonderful!","10"
"Shereen appartment's is a very nice place. Very clean! Exactly like on the photos ! The pool on the rooftop is a plus ! Shereen answers very quickly if you have a question. We highly recommend it.","10"
"Shereen was an amazing host. The neighborhood was everything my gf and I could have asked for. Its quiet and residential but also hip and lively in a short walk. This trip meant a lot to my gf and I and Shereen's place made it that much better.

We 100% would love to stay there the next time we come to Montreal. As we will definitely be back!
","10"
"Shereen is a great host, got everything we need before we check-in. The location is great where closed to a lot of attractions and public transportations. Definitely will come back next time.","10"
"This a lovely place - everything is just as it appears in the photos! The building and amenities are great - especially the rooftop pool and seating areas.","10"
"Shereen was very helpful in terms of providing restaurant and entertainment recommendations and her place was beautiful and clean, just as the photos show. There was one surprise that the photos show but I didn't realize until we arrived - the large windows don't have any curtains. If you're a morning person, this is lovely, but it does make sleeping in difficult when the sun rises so early. ","10"
"Shereens place was great and just as beautiful as the pictures. She made us feel very comfortable and gave us really good suggestions on things to do and see.","10"
"Awesome place looks exactly like the pictures!","10"
"Shereen's place was really great.  Overall, a 10 out of 10.  The condo was as advertised in the photos, but pictures don't do the bed and shower justice.   The memory foam bed was very comfortable and the shower has some serious pressure.  Easy kitchen in which to cook, and the wifi was very reliable.  Only ""hang ups"" were with check-in (had to pull bed sheets/pillow cases out of the dryer and put them on bed/pillows myself) and parking, from time to time.  While parking is, in fact, free, it's not entirely hassle-free.  To Shereen's credit, though, she makes this known in her condo's listing.   Parking in front of the condo is nearly always filled up. On Rues Bourget, Irene, Sainte-Antoine, and Sainte-Jacques (four main streets near the condo) you don't have to pay to park, but you're not allowed to park during certain weekly times.  For example, on the north side of Rue Bourget (right in front of the building) you'll be ticketed if your car is parked between 8 and 11:30 am.  Then, on the opposite side of the street, you're forced to move your car on Tuesdays from noon to 3:30 pm.  Moral of the story?  Come enjoy Shereen's awesome condo, just don't bring a car.  You can Uber anywhere from her centrally-located spot in less than ten minutes for about ten bucks.  Overall, an awesome stay and I look forward to being back.","10"
"Shereen's place was bright and clean. Close walking distance to  Metro. The roof top pool was nice, however the gym was across the street in a different building. 
If you're looking to be a little outside of the downtown core this place is oerfect. ","10"
"This is a fabulous place if you want to combine busy city weekend with some relax time by the pool. Very cool indeed.","10"
"Le logement est identique aux photos présentées dans l'annonce: magnifique. Le coin est calme et super beau! Pout ce qui est de Shereen, elle est très gentille. Elle répond rapidement aux messages ce qui est génial! Avant d'arriver, elle nous recommande plusieurs restaurants et endroits à voir ce qui aide beaucoup. ","10"
"Shereen was such an amazing and helpful host!! The location was perfect, and gorgeous (the pictures don't do it justice). I just totally recommend it all around. ","10"
"Loved Shereen's place. Clean home and has all necessary basics. She is a great host, and offers lots of suggestions for Montreal. Thank you!! ","10"
"Apartament amb un disseny remarcable, cuidat, molt agradable, ben equipat i molt net. Ben situat a pocs minuts a peu de l’estació de metro, en poques parades et situes al centre.","10"
"She's the sweetest person ever if u are looking for a great place u should stay at her place.","10"
"There's nothing you won't like about the design and furniture of this place. Beautiful. It's like a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station. Also around a 15 minute walk to St. Catherine which is a main spot for tourists. The building is very nice. Shereen was so sweet, I met with her when checking in and she was willing to help with everything I had, lovely lady!","10"
"The place is great, it really is as advertised in photos. The curtains are the only thing I can think of as a slight negative. They are a bit too thin. They let a lot of light in, and you may need to get dressed in the bathroom if you have some privacy concerns. Apartment has anything you may need. Shereen responds fast if you have any questions. Overall, we were very happy.","10"
"Shereen's place is exactly(!) as pictured and was perfect in terms of design and layout. Extremely clean and spacious, with a pleasant view of the street and plenty of natural light. Shereen herself was as pleasant, responsive, and helpful as any Airbnb host with whom I've ever stayed - she gave great tips on both the surrounding neighborhood and city as a whole. Finally, I loved the gym (across the street) and rooftop lounge area - peaceful with amazing views.","10"
"Shereen's place is a nice cozy studio. It felt very homey and looked amazing, the pictures don't do it justice! Shereen is a great host. She was flexible with our check in/out time. The neighborhood is nice and quiet yet very convenient with plenty of places close by. I had no issues with street parking, however do read the posted signs. I would highly recommend staying here and would love to visit again.","10"
"Centrally located on a quiet street in one of the hippest neighborhoods of Montreal. Shereen was very acomidating and the bed is super comfy!","10"
"Shereen was extremely helpful with giving us information for our stay. Her place was kept very clean and it's a very nice quiet atmosphere. My husband and I stayed this past weekend with our 6 month old for our wedding anniversary and it was a perfect place for house. The washer and dryer is a bonus too.","10"
"Shereen was a terrific host, easy to communicate with and very easy check-in/check-out.  The place very clean, as described and the building has wonderful amenities.  Highly recommended.","10"
"We had a great stay at Shereen's place. We love the converted loft style and loved how the condo was decorated. Check in was super easy and Shereen was kind enough to let us check in a couple of hours early. The building is located in a quiet residential area. Bed was comfortable. Would recommend!","10"
"I stayed here previously and both experiences were great. Perfect stylish loft that is clean, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood. Shereen is a wonderful and helpful host. Highly recommended.","10"
"Very stylish apartment. Great location - close to a lot of restaurants and shops. Shereen was very quick to respond and check-in was a breeze.","10"
"Great place! Nice and cozy. Very comfy bed :)","10"
"Great place in St Henri - very clean, has everything you need, close to the metro. You have access to the gym in the building which is very well equipped and convenient. You are just a few min walk from the metro and some great restaurants as well. Would highly recommend staying here.","10"
"Great place.  10 min walk to Lionel-Groulx metro station.  Very clean and quiet.  Washer/dryer in unit works well.  Host was very responsive.  I texted her that the internet was down, and 2 minutes later she was on the phone with the provider, and service was restored within 10 minutes.","10"
"My stay was great. I was traveling on my own and found that the apartment was spacious and had everything I needed. Shereen was incredibly responsive and thoughtful throughout my stay.  I'd highly recommend staying here.","10"
"We had a mini road trip and decided to stay in Montreal for 2 days. The place was very clean and tidy. It was close to the places we wanted to visit. Shereen was very responsive to answer all of our question. We enjoyed our stay there. Thank you.","10"
"This place was absolutely GORGEOUS. Everything you could hope for in an airbnb. The pictures are absolutely true to what it is! If anything, they undersell the spacious, luxurious nature of this loft. Shereen was the most gracious host! She accommodated our check in time and responded within minutes of messages. The apartment is incredible - big ceilings, clean, fabulous kitchen and bathroom!  It is so open and warm (quite literally, toasty with the heating system!). She has all necessary kitchen items/utensils needed - plates, dishes, knives, pots and pans, etc. The gym was gorgeous - a room for floor work (the yoga room) equipped with weights, mats, kettleballs, etc. as well as multiple cardio machines, weight machines available in the main gym space. 

Truly, there is little you could want or need for at this place. Parking was so easy and the area is great with tons of lovely restaurants, easy access to groceries, and very accessible to downtown Montreal.","10"
"Very nice unit in a great location. 
Perfect for one person or a couple.
Shereen was quick to respond to messages and made me feel very welcome. 

The parking is free in some areas on the street, however you will have to move your car daily depending on the section of the road. 

The building was very safe, the amenities were as expected and the unit was nice and tidy.

It was a great spot, definitely recommend it!","10"
"Shereen’s place was clean and stylish. Had everything I needed except parking. When the listing said “free parking on premises” I assumed that meant there was parking on the premises but apparently it means there is some free street parking on the adjacent streets. However the signage was confusing for a non-local and I had trouble finding parking on multiple occasions (especially if I arrived later in the evening). Other than that everything was good. Pool was closed. Gym was across the street and looked decent but I didn’t end up using it.","10"
"Great place, near from the Metro. Cozy and stylish!","10"
"The place was amazing, Shereen provided excellent recommendations and helped make an all around good trip even better!","10"
"Sakina and her family were great hosts. She is always available to help. The place is really nice and comfortable. I recommend Sakina's place and will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Montreal.","10"
"Despite the location being a little out of the way, it was wonderful, cute, and clean. We had a great stay! :)","10"
"Je trouve le quartier résidentiel les gens très sympathiques aussi 
Restauration pas très loin par contre pas de très bonnes qualités dommage
Un peu loin du centre ville
","10"
"Sakina was a great host, and the townhome was awesome. Spotlessly clean and in a great area close to the heart of Montreal. I highly recommend it!","10"
"This is a cozy, comfortable basement suite in a quiet residential section of Montreal (NDG). Sakina is an attentive hostess, very responsive by text both before and during our stay. There is free parking on site behind the building, which was great. We really enjoyed exploring the neighbourhood, and it is a short walk to the number 105 bus which links to the metro system. There is also a small fridge and microwave, which we did not expect but of course were very appreciated. Our party was 2 adults and 3 kids, and there was plenty of space for all of us. ","10"
"We were delighted with Sakina's basement apartment. It was clean and large and private, with two decent-sized bedrooms and a very large living/dining/common room, and a locking door separating it from the rest of the house. We had exclusive use of the washer/dryer that was in our space, and on-premises parking. It worked extremely well as a comfortable home base for our family of 5 during our 5-day stay in Montreal. ","10"
"Very clean. Suited our needs. Great value.","10"
"Sakina and her family were very friendly. We definitely enjoyed our stay. The apartment was clean, cozy, and had everything we needed.","10"

"Sakina est très accueillante très disponible aussi pour mon deuxième séjour impeccable merci pour tout","10"
"Sakina's place was sparkling clean, convenient for a family of four.
The location is in a quiet residential area 15 mins away from downtown by car. 
Sakina is very welcoming and made up feel at easy which made our holidays even more enjoyable.","10"
"Sakina's place by far has been my greatest stay. Sakina was a great host providing all essentials and even had breakfast foods, including milk, stocked for us. The space was large and the beds were very comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and close to public transportation. I would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Sakina's place was great and just what we needed. We were traveling with a single person and a couple so we needed two bedrooms and a common space, and this worked out perfectly. We had a nice couch to relax on and watch TV, along with a table and chairs for eating. Sakina even left us a variety of breakfast food, which was a nice surprise. There was a fridge and microwave as well. The apartment was very clean and quiet, and she left plenty of amenities like shampoo, extra blankets, and a hairdryer. The neighborhood is quiet and residential, and it's a short drive from the city center not far out of the way. One day Sakina asked to borrow a table in our space for a birthday party, and when we came home we found that she had returned the table with slices of cake for us! We felt very welcome and there was a good mix of communication and privacy.

L'appartement a été très bien, propre, et dans un quartier calme et résidentiel mais quand même pas trop loin du centre ville. C'était parfait pour plusieurs personnes, dans notre cas moi et une couple, vu qu'il y a plusieurs chambres dans un espèce d'appartement privé dans le sous sol. Il y a également une espace commun dans l'appartement pour parler, regarder la télé, et manger ensemble. Sakina a même laissé des choses à manger pour le petit déjeuner. On sentait très à l'aise, confortable, et les bienvenus dans cette espace. Merci, Sakina !","10"
"I found this place to be very spacious and clean. It was easy to get to and from and Sakina was very easy to communicate with. I would recommend it to anyone.","10"
"Sakina's basement has everything. It's very clean and it's very spacious. There're many things included: breakfast and bathroom soap etccc..
The relationship prize-quality is fantastic. I recommend it.","10"
"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Sakina, qui s'est montrée disponible et attentive. Le quartier est sympa, a 25-30 minutes du centre de Montréal en voiture ou en bus. Nous recommandons ce logement à d'autres voyageurs ! Encore merci Sakina ;)","10"
"It's very good place to stay.","10"
"Everything was fine! Good place!","10"
"I booked this cozy basement for one of my friends who came to Canada for the first time, and she could not afford the cost to stay in hotel due to high season. Sakina was very communicative and she arranged everything for her and her family.","10"
"Great place! It was nice having two separate rooms, and the living area was perfect for hanging out.","10"
"Nice and tidy basement accommodation,  suitable for family, quite street, very accessible to highways. Friendly host SAKINA*****","10"
"I stayed 3 days at Sakina's basement appartement which was very spacious, cleaned and had all of the comfort and essentials we needed. It was also very easy and clear to communicate with Sakina and she was accommodating. We would definitely stayed with Sakina again.","10"
"Very clean, beautiful and spacious 2 bedroom basement. Our host Sakina provided everything for breakfast we needed. We really enjoyed our stay at her place and we would recommend to everyone to go there if you!","10"
"Sakina is a very nice host, welcoming and helpful whenever needed. The place was right for us, and we look forward to staying again here!","10"
"It’s a beautiful and cozy place to stay, very clean and Sakina is so friendly and kind. You can take transportation just around the corner to go to downtown or any of the most touristic places in Montreal, my family and I had a great experience!","10"
"Great space, very close to the downtown area. Has all the amenities you need for a great stay.","10"
"Appartement propre,accueillant et pratique. Notre hôte a su bien nous accueillir et répondre à nos besoins. Il est facile de communiquer avec l'hôte.","10"
"Great little 2 bedroom apartment in the west end of Montreal. Great location with good bus service. Grocery and drug stores nearby, as well as a couple of pizza joints. I like the parking at the rear, don't like leaving my car parked at the curb in Montreal. Everything for a nice stay is provided, will definitely go back.","10"
"Very clean. Sakina is also very quick at responding. It is a large space as well and very clean.","10"
"We had a lovely stay at Sakina's and all five of us (2 adults and 3 children) slept well. Her home was very spacious and tastefully decorated.

We appreciated that Sakina provided us with all the breakfast essentials (bread and spreads, milk, cheese, cereal, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc.) As parents, she made our life so much easier, especially when traveling from afar.

Sakina really went the extra mile by helping us recover our youngest daughter's  forgotten stuffed animal.

We would definitely welcome an opportunity to enjoy her home again and would not hesitate to recommend her.","10"
"The space was very clean . Sakina provided us with breakfast and was prompt in replying back","10"
"Sakina was very nice to me and my familly. We were supposed to stay for a month , upon arrival we realized that there wasn’t any stove for cooking, hence, we only stayed there for one day. It was our fault we didn’t read properly the comments that Sakina posted. She agreed on refunding us the full price.","10"
"Super endroit, très propre","10"
"Sakina provide us a compliment breakfast, it was perfect for the first day.  the place is very, very clean, and very confortable. Sakina answer us really quick, and help us in what we need. You gonna love the place!!","10"

"Great location and could not be cleaner.  Fantastic value.","10"
"Great hospitality, clean, and spacious place to stay!","10"
"My wife and I stayed at Sakina's place for 3 nights/4 days. The place was very clean and, for a couple, very spacious. The place had the essentials needed for a good stay. We liked that Sakina offered us parking behind the building (her private parking area). There were a couple of things that we didn't like, though. The first one was that Sakina's was not quick at responding to our messages. Actually, she never answered the first message we sent her once we were in her property, and she was not prompt to respond to a couple of other messages. The second thing is that the place gets very noisy from around 5am to around 8am. We stayed there during weekdays and in the basement we could hear them getting prepared for their day. In all, we had a good stay, but based on previous reviews we had higher expectations. Thanks.","10"
"Would recommend a stay with Sakina without any hesitation. Everything we wanted and more. Wonderful hostess and so helpful with directions, as this was our first trip to Montreal. Very quite house and surroundings.
Close to bus stop and Metro, which meant not having to use our car.","10"
"Close to the bus stop and it was a perfect, clean space for our family!  Some breakfast foods provided and water was helpful in the mornings.  The sofa bed was comfy too.  We had a great time!","10"
"Wonderful hospitality.We felt like our own home.Very neat and clean space.Good parking facility.Breakfast was awesome.","10"
"amazing place. better than staying in the hotel. I will recommend this place to Everyone","10"
"The listing said a/c is not available however the host provided us with fan for each room as it felt warm, Parking was not an issue, check in was smooth, the only down side was that we felt the linens were not washed as 3 of us had red spots that looks like bites on the face and neck after the first night. ","10"
"Totalement satisfait par le logement, même mieux que sur les photos. Sakina à été un hôte disponible et serviable.
Je recommande sans hésiter.","10"
"こちらからの質問に対して､とても対応が素早くとても助かりました｡","10"
"Sakina is a wonderful host! She prepared the place very nicely and provided us with more than just basic necessities. The location was perfect as it was very easy to drive downtown (about 10-15 min) and there were a lot of restaurants in walking distance in the quiet neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again if I ever went back to Montreal!","10"

"Eve's house is nice, in a great location and very close to subway station. It is perfect for a cheap weekend in the city! ","9"
"I had high expectations from the pictures of the place and my short conversation with Eve. Taking that into account, the experience still highly surpassed my expectations. Eve is an amazing person that is more a friend than a host after having met her for a few minutes.","9"
"Pascale was great abs super accommodating. Will stay there again","10"
"Pascal left us with a very cozy and organized house that my family enjoyed a lot. Every thing seems perfect. RECOMMEND!","10"

"Vous voulez visiter Montréal en famille? La maison de Pascal est l'endroit idéal.  La maison est parfaite pour petites ou grandes familles. Pascal a été superbe, ayant répondu à chacune de nos questions. Nous n'hésiterons pas de suggérer l'endroit pour une famille. Les enfants ont bien aimé.

L'emplacement est central et facile d'accès. C'est facile à se déplacer à pied, en autobus ou en Métro. Nous avons visiter des attraits touristiques comme le Vieux-Port, le Biodôme et la Ronde, et on a pu se rendre à chacun de ces endroits en moins d'une demi heure.

Merci pour votre accueil chaleureux!","10"

"The view from the room is perfect. Jeremy was great host, highly recommend to anyway that's visiting the city!","10"
"Jeremy was a great host. Very hospitable. We only stayed two nights to see the sights, events and nightlife they had going on in Montreal that weekend. The room is great size for a couple has closet and its own washroom. The kitchen is quaint and clean. 

He even gave us a continental style breakfast the morning after our first stay. He did not have too but it's just a testament of how hospitable he is. The room is literally next to the laundry room and pool as listed. The view from his balcony is great. You're right in the centre of Montreal near shopping ball, restaurants. His place is right next to a stall of Bixi bikes for those who like a little workout in the morning.

There is a fan in the room but it never really gets hot considering the draft coming from the balcony.

Communication-wise Jeremy is very efficient. He responds within 5-15 min. Mind you, you barely see Jeremy unless you have a question or you see him doing upkeep on the place which is nothing against him but it shows that you kind of feel alone in the place which is nice and is probably the idea he was going for.

All in all I would stay here again and probably will.","10"
"An absolutely amazing apartment and host. The best ever. JEREMY has not hosted before; however, all hosts can learn from him. His apartment is amazing and you will not need a thing. Everything is provided including laundry detergent. Swimming Pool in across the hall and you have no neighbors. Outside deck on same floor and one above the roof. The views of the city are actually best from the bedroom and the veranda outside the living room. JEREMY will be seeing me again.","10"
"We enjoyed Jeremy's penthouse. The bedroom was spacious, the bed was comfortable and the towels and linens were high end. Great views of the city! We visited in the summer and the room was a little warm, no AC, but fans are available and with the windows open you can get a good cross breeze. Close to metro and lots of restaurants. Jeremy is very considerate and helped me to get accumulated to the city. ","10"

"Jeremy was an amazing host, the apartment was very nice! pool was right across the room. He even made a little breakfast basket for us in the morning. My friend and I could not have had a better experience with an Air BnB, thank you Jeremy","10"
"This is by far one of the best locations you could stay at in Montreal!
The room is spacious enough to hold two guests plus the access to pool and sauna makes this location an excellent choice (and don't get me started on the view!).
The host—Jeremy—was extremely friendly and open minded.
Totally worth checking this location.","10"

"This is my dream apartment: a penthouse with beautiful skyline of the city, in-building swimming pool & sauna (on the same floor), spacious bedroom with personal full bathroom, cozy living room, walking distance to great restaurants and metro stations. Jeremy has been helpful, friendly, and accommodating! He provided light breakfast (bagels, orange juice, fruits). Tea and coffee are available in the kitchen, whenever you like. He labeled the things you might need in the common area (trash, mugs, tea/coffee, spice, ...). A great experience with a great host.","10"

"We had a wonderful stay! Very nice, clean bedroom attached to a bathroom with shower, and well-stocked kitchen (we cooked a meal and enjoyed the complimentary fruit and bagels for breakfast). We loved the pool across the hall!! The mattress is on the firmer side which wasn't ideal for my partner (who has spinal disc pain) but it felt totally normal to me and I slept very nicely. The comforter is VERY cozy and the blackout shades were great. There is absolutely no street noise and there are restaurants, grocery stores, a mall, and a metro station in the area that we made full use of. In fact we took many recommendations from Jeremy's wonderful guide!! I would highly recommend this place!!!!","10"
"Appartement très bien situé avec parking, ce qui est un avantage. Vue magnifique de Montréal. Et petit plus, une piscine spatieuse et très propre.

Jérémy est un hôte aux petits soins.","10"
"À un jet de pierre de Ste-Catherine, vue époustouflante sur le centre-ville, accès au sauna et piscine. Hôte très sympathique.","10"
"The view from Jeremy's place is just amazing! Very easy self-check in with well laid-out instructions. Located right downtown close to lots of restaurants, things to do, and the metro to get a little further away - we didn't use our car at all the 2 days we visited, so having the parking spot available was great. The floor is high up enough that street noise is not a problem. Having a private bathroom is always great. Very clean throughout and Jeremy was very accommodating. We had a great time.","10"
"The penthouse has great views and was well located for our local destinations.  Glad to have the heated, offstreet parking.","10"
"It’s a perfect stay, close to everything, big and comfy bed, pool + sauna on same floor, nice view of the room and a good host, 100% recommend","10"
"Perfect location and price, best place to rent in all of Montreal.","10"
"Great location - <10min walk to a metro station, 1 block from a grocery store, with numerous restaurants and cafes nearby. The penthouse view is stunning, and the space has everything you need. Even though it is a shared space, Jeremy makes it feel very welcoming. The rules and boundries of the space are clearly communicated, so you know what is acceptable and what is not, which I found helped me feel less like a guest.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 83 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"It would definitely enhance the place if we had a Sofa, a TV set, and a Microwave. Host had put food which is a great gesture but mostly we never used anything as we had our own stuff.","10"
"This apartment is in a great area of town. You will be able to get to most things from here very easily.  The hosts are extremely responsive and the view from the apartment is amazing.","10"
"We were hosted by Steven, an associate of Jeremy’s, who was very attentive and responsive. ","10"
"Great location, spacious apartment with great views and a pool across the hallway. I would stay here again. ","10"
"Really great downtown location, close to lots of bars and restaurants and metro.  Easy check the in and out, would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Great location and very communicative host. Note that there is no a/c although there are fans in the rooms.
","10"
"This penthouse apartment is well represented by the post and pictures. Our host, Steve was very responsive. Location is central to the old Montreal area with a lot of food and activities within walking distance. Having parking included is a definite plus!","10"
"Catherine's place is bright and very comfortable, in a quiet street in a fantastic neighbourhood with easy access to transit - her restaurant, cafe, and bar recommendations were great! Catherine is helpful and clear - it was easy to get hold of her immediately when I had questions. Thanks Catherine!","10"
"Appart vivant et chaleureux, tres sympa ou nous nous sommes tous tres vite sentis a l'aise ! Le quartier est top. commerces, restos et bistros plutots trendy a portée de main. Catherine a etée particulierment dispo et reactive et les echanges etaient parfaitement agréables. Ses conseils ont etes appreciés. Trés bonne adresse sur Montreal !","10"
"Great place for families. Quiet street, plenty of space, nice kitchen. Lots of good tips on restaurants and the area.","10"
"Catherine was a great host and quick to respond to any questions we had. Her place is charming and in a fantastic area with everything you need. Her local recommendations were spot on - best croissant I've ever had!","10"
"Great host. helpful and always replies back fast. the place is clean and cozy. I will definitely revisit when I have a chance.","10"
"The home is as advertised - spacious and convenient to get to. The beds are comfortable, bedding & towels were clean and the tub in the master bedroom was nice! 
Communication with Rina and her brother Joss was easy, and they were very attentive to making sure we had what we needed for a great stay. Joss lives upstairs in a different unit, so he was close by when we had questions (of which we had only one, to do with the TV). 
We'd definitely stay again! ","10"
"We loved staying here! The location is amazing, the house is child/baby friendly, everything was neat, host was always in touch to check up on us, the are stores near by, subway station is 2 blocks away, there's a 24 hour bar one block away, it was great! I will definitely stay there again :) ","10"
"Great place!","10"
"Appartement bien situé pour visiter Montréal, spacieux.

"That's a wonderful place to stay with my family","10"
"If you are taking a trip to Montreal you absolutely have to stay here at this apartment. It's not only that it's a fantastic apartment and near the Metro. It's not only that it's quiet and very roomy and perfect for a solo traveler, couple, or group. It's that the host, Therese, is absolutely outstanding. She met me for check-in after 3am because of traffic. She made sure I had everything I needed. She even made authentic Pho and another Vietnamese traditional soup. She showed me the sights of the city and told me about the ones that she thought it should see without her when she had errands. I told her that I am learning French because I am going to grad school in France next year and she took the time to give me some pointers. All in all, Therese made the trip to Montreal that much more enjoyable and exceeded expectations. ","9"
"The apartment was comfortable, clean and located very close to public transportation. Therese was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay at Therese's again.","9"
"Therese was a great host!  The apartment was very clean and spacious and it was great to have breakfast foods available for us to fuel up before we headed out to explore Montreal.  The only issues we had were with the wifi being down and there not being air conditioning.  Therese was very communicative and gave us some great suggestions for things to do around the city.  The location so near the Metro made getting around the city very easy!","9"
"Great place and great host, would come back if I go to Montreal again.","9"
"You will not find a cleaner place than Therese's! She was very friendly and accommodating. She suggested places for us to tour in Montreal when our plans got rained out and she has NETFLIX!","9"
"Therese is a wonderful host.  She is very attentive and responsive.  Her apartment is sparkling clean and the king size bed is high quality and dreamy. 
She is right next door for early or late evening help, and is extremely willing to be of assistance.
Her neighborhood is the most ethnically diverse in Montreal.  North African cafes are just down the street. Public bikes are available for rent 2 blocks away at the Metro station.  This is a great place to get a glimpse of how real people live their lives in Montreal.  Two thumbs up!","9"
"Therese was absolutely great! Her place was cozy and cute and was exactly what we were looking for. It was a little bit farther away from the main attractions of Montreal than I thought it would be but the train station is close by and about a 20 minute uber ride away. The fact that this place had a parking spot for us was so helpful. Therese provided us with great suggestions of things to do and was so flexible with check in and check out. Would definitely recommend this place for your stay. Thanks!","9"
"The place is as advertised, cozy and clean. The host is excellent and thoughtful!  Very close to a major subway line - commuting was very easy.","9"
"Great apartment good value clean , Very close to attractions such as Bio-dome, Botanical garden, Insectarium...  Metro stop two minutes away. As well as a hidden st-viateur bagel bakery located in the corner market.","9"
"Therese was a very gracious hostess. Check in & out were seamless. The parking spot was clutch. Apartment was clean & comfortable.","9"
"Therese est très accueillante et souriante, arrangeante et reste disponible à la moindre question. Elle n'hésite pas à demander si tout se passe bien pendant le séjour. 
Le logement est très agréable et confortable, propre et correspond totalement à la description, tout est fourni. À côté du métro, supermarché juste à côté. Il n'y a rien à redire. 
Je recommande sans hésiter.","9"
"Therese's apartment was immaculate and was perfect for a couple.  The apartment is only two short blocks from the Metro which made it extremely easy to get around the city.  Therese is an extremely helpful and communicative host.  I highly recommend both her and her apartment.","9"
"Therese is a great host! The apartment is roomy and has beautiful floors. The train station is very close, and Jean Talon has plenty of small restaurants in walking distance. I was also relieved to have a parking space and a gated back yard to store a bike.","9"
"Peggy and I enjoyed our stay in Montreal to the max in part because of the kindness and warm hospitality of Therese.  She readily answered all the questions a typical tourist would ask.  ""Where can I access the Metro?  Where is the nearest grocery store that has great produce?""  Over and beyond the expectations of anyone, Therese got our stay off to a great start with breakfast treats.  Therese's apartment has excellent location--just a 5 minute walk to the Metro which then gives one access to almost all the tourist destinations.  One does not have to remember complicated bus routes in order to get around in Montreal--the Metro is fast, efficient and inexpensive.  We had no need for a car at any time while we were in Montreal.  So, I would say to prospective guests, treat yourself with a marvelous stay in Petite-Patrie with Therese.","9"
"It was exactly like the pictures. Very convenient and close to the metro. The parking was very useful. Therese was an awesome host and very helpful!","9"
"Endroit confortable et propre.  Près du métro.  La dame est très accueillante, serviable et aimable.  C'est privé (appartement au complet).","9"
"The pictures of the place are very accurate. One of the great things with this place is that it comes with an actual parking spot vs on the street. (Can be difficult to figure out 3 different parking signs on one post). The place was very clean and Therese was able to get is the keys when we arrived. However the only negative thing that I have to say is that the walls are very thin and any noise outside can be heard very clearly inside. (Only a downside if you're a light sleeper). Therese was  a great host and had checked in to ensure we had everything we needed. The overall feel of the home was feeling as if you were a guest in someone else's home verses a hotel.","9"
"We booked Therese's apartment for our trip to Montreal and we were happy that we did. The location worked great for us, Therese was more than perfect communicating with us every time very quick and we had good time there. 
The apartment is as described, a nice modern touch, perfect for a couple, clean and the fact that there is a reserved parking spot is a very appreciated bonus saving the big city parking headaches.
You can leave your car there and walk few minutes to city's transit, very easy to make it to all your favorites spots. And if you don't have a list Therese will help you with all kind of ideas.
A thank you note for you Therese from both of us.
Laura and Mitch","9"
"Apartment was perfect for one person or a couple. Bright and clean with a great king-sized bed! Also, easy to get to when driving, although better to avoid rush hour, but this applies to anywhere in Montreal. Subway just a block away making it easy to get downtown and back.","9"
"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had (and I use it a fair bit!). The spot was well-located, barely a 5-minute walk to St. Michel subway station, which makes it easy to get anywhere in the city. The apartment was incredibly comfortable, with a wonderful big comfy bed, really nice living room/sofa to lounge in and watch Netflix, a nice spacious kitchen, etc. But the best part was the host - Therese was one of the nicest hosts I've met, super-quick with responses and information. We were there over a holiday and she gave lots of information about what was open and what wasn't, even loaned us items for some elaborate cooking we decided to do. Anyway I could go on, but the point is that this was among the best Airbnb experiences I've had - highly recommended! Therese was an amazing host and you will not be disappointed with this place!","9"
"Quel magnifique appartement! Nous avons adoré notre petit séjour romantique, c'était le parfait nid d'amour :-)","9"
"I must admit, there is nothing negative i can say about the experience I got from Therese and her Airbnb spot. Coming from someone who is somewhat picky about these things my stay was amazing, from the cleanness of the place to everything being a walk away to the quick and clear responses and follow ups from Therese through out the day to make sure everything is going well and if I needed anything. Parking is super you have your own spot right in front of the building on a private property. You have all the essentials and much more. I have already told Therese how satisfied I was and the next time I need a get away to Montreal her place is most likely the place I would stay without question. I can continue writing nothing but positive stuff but if read this far just book Therese's place and enjoy!","9"
"Therese's place was amazing, and her communication was prompt and so informative. From the moment I booked to the moment I walked through the front door, Therese was so welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed. 

Kitchen was huge and spacious and was stocked with food. In fact, the whole house was actually bigger than I anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise. Best of all: comfiest bed ever. 

Super pro: the parking spot. Parking in Montreal can be a nightmare. Not here! If you have a car, this is a huge perk and really made coming and going so easy. Location-wise, if you have a car, the house is conveniently situated and not too far from many sights. 

10000% recommend anyone to stay here. It's a gem :)","9"
"We loved this place. It was perfect. Therese thought of every last detail to make our stay great. My only negative point was that we only had 1 fork. But we made do. It was nicely decorated and comfortable. It truly felt like home. We can’t wait to stay again.","9"
"It was a short weekend/stay but my boyfriend and I were pleased with how clean the place was. It was just perfect and the parking spot is an added bonus :) 
Thank you for everything!","9"
"A very positive experience and on Christmas Day even!!","9"
"Great location,  spacious apartment. Therese was great at communicating.
Apartment was as described.  Kitchen could use a couple more things to make it useful, such as a can opener (We borrowed one from them when asked), a pot to cook in.
Best to call ahead to make sure that the parking spot is available when you arrive.
Convenient location. Comfortable bed.","9"
"Everything was great.  Especially having reserved parking.","9"
"Appartement bien situé, proche du métro et des commerces. Thérèse est d'une gentillesse incroyable et se met en quatre pour satisfaire les demandes","9"
"Large one bedroom and large living room, big kitchen, Just 2 minuets walk from Saint Michael Metro,  the place was quite nice and warm, Therese and her family live right next door and they’re  super nice,  I enjoyed my stay there","9"
"Therese's apartment was wonderful. Plenty of space, amenities, and a great location. The parking space was a savior! The apartment itself was clean, easy to get to, and very close to the Metro. We had a great experience!","9"

"Cozy, clean, and comfortable! The three C's of an excellent Airbnb. It was just unfortunate I didn't get the chance to meet the host in person but she was quite reachable at most times. 10/10 would recommend to a friend!","9"
"everything was great! therese responded so quickly and she gave us so many good tips about things we should do in montreal!","9"
"Therese est très sympathique et l'appartement est parfait. Je recommande!","9"
"communication could have been better, but great value overall because of location and price. Unit was clean and exactly as the photos. subway is a short 3 min walk. surprise bonus was the smart tv where I could cast movies from my phone to the TV.","9"
"Theresa's home was excellent. Her apartment(3rd floor) has separate entrance, bright and has many amenities including washer & dryer which will be nice for long term staying. Theresa answered our questions in quick manner. We recommend Theresa's home.","9"
"Excellent logement très clair calme confortable , avec des hôtes très attentifs et prévenants. Le cadre est encore plus agréable que sur les photos. De beaux équipements et de l’espace.
Excellent rapport qualité prix. À recommander très fortement","9"
"Therese and her family were great hosts.  The apartment is nicely decorated and furnished and is ultra clean.  Despite the heat outside, the apartment was nice and cool inside.  And the kitchen has everything for you to have a great stay. I would recommend this place without any hesitation.","9"
"Therese's place is very well located, close to Jean Talon Market, metro and good restaurants. Therese was quick to respond to questions. The apartment is very clean and the bed is super comfortable. Parking is available on-site which is a plus! You will need to walk up a few flights of stairs to go to the apartment but that is quite typical in Montreal. Would definitely recommend your next stay with Therese!","9"
"Therese and her family are very sweet and helpful. There are not many amenities in the space but if you don’t mind commuting into the city via the metro or bus, it’s a perfect place.","9"
"Therese’s place is great; clean and the parking space was helpful. 
Metro was needed to go into Old Montreal, but it was very close. Simple apartment which is just what we needed when staying two nights. 
I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants a value for being in the city but not feel like they’re in a rush. If we are ever in Montreal again, Therese’s place is our first choice for sure!!","9"
"Our stay in Therese's apartment was wonderful! The parking space attached to the home made arrival and check-in easy, and the air conditioning unit in the bedroom was a godsend during the heatwave. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated (with touches like flowers and trays of glassware ready for use), and perfectly sized for the two of us. We also loved the location - a short walk to both the metro and a nearby grocery. The one issue we encountered was around checkout. When we asked near the beginning of the visit what time we should expect to check out, Therese's answer was an hour earlier than the time listed on the website - which was fine with us, and we planned accordingly. However, on the night before our departure, she sent us a message at 11:30pm asking if we would be able to leave between 8-10am and if we would be able to move the car around the same time. In the end, we left and moved the car only an hour before our planned departure time. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at this Airbnb, but the muddled information about checkout added an extra layer of complication to the end of our stay.","9"
"Therese's place is very clean & she is  very responsive with all communication. Her place is very convenient for walking to metro & there is a wonderful patisserie right across from D'Iberville station to get breakfast on your way into city.","9"
"Very comfortable, close to transportation and well maintained! Full kitchen and A/C in the bedroom a definite +, would recommend!","9"
"What a nice host! Super clean space and always willing to help. Highly recommend staying here!","9"
"Had a great time!","9"
"We had a fantastic stay at Therese’s place! Fantastic communication beforehand with check-in, tips for during our stay once we arrived, and an easy check-out! The place is very clean and even seemed to be bigger than expected for an apartment in the city! We were also very happy about the private parking space so we didn’t have to worry about our car at all during our trip. Like everyone else has mentioned, this is a short five minute walk to the metro and will get you anywhere you need to be in the city. Highly recommend staying with Therese! ","9"
"Wonderful, clean apartment! The space was perfect for my little family and me. The dedicated parking space was so appreciated as there was no street parking at all. The Netflix and wifi were perfect, and we also used the clothes washer and dryer. The host did not intrude at all and her family who also live in the building were so nice! ","9"
"Thérèse's apartment is great value for your money! It is incredibly well situated.  There is a grocery store around the corner, the Métro is within walking distance and the highway is close by.  There are lots of local restaurants nearby as well. It is quiet, and the neighbors are friendly but unobtrusive. 

My wife and I really liked the layout of the apartment; it provides privacy between guests if needed.  It was clean and nicely decorated. The bed is a comfortable king size. We loved the lounging area with a large comfortable couch and high def tv with Netflix. We were able to prepare and cook meals in the large kitchen. Thérèse was responsive to our messages, referred us to places to go and was kind enough to offer complementary bottles of water.

I would highly recommend Thérèse's place! Thank you, Thérèse!","9"
"Therese is an excellent host. The apartment is super clean, located near the metro station in a quiet neighborhood. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Montreal. ","9"
"The private parking & nearby metro made navigating the city as a pedestrian very easy.","9"
"Her place was so beautiful and cozy.  Would stay anytime.","9"
"L'appartement était super propre, lit confortable. Le stationnement privé était pratique pour moi.","9"
"Therese’s place was fantastic! We were greeted by her aunt and uncle who were so friendly and welcoming! The place is clean, spacious and well lit. Location is great for public transit (<5 minute walk to the metro). The bed was really comfortable, plus my boyfriend loved having the king size bed since he is very tall. Just a tip if you are using the parking space, there is a window to another apartment unit right behind the parking spot so don’t back in!","9"
"Location and neighbourhood not great. Smaller than expected and with very small investments could be a lot more inviting. A lot of random posters and personal items around the place when it seems to be a full time vacation rental. Host was good and place was comfortable but it was not near all of the things it says, and I didn’t feel great walking around the neighbourhood. I paid less for a much cleaner place in the heart of downtown, but it would be a good place to stay if they were charging less. As is, I wouldn’t recommend.","9"
"Definitely one of the best air bnb experiences I’ve ever had. It’s a cute little apartment perfect for a couple and close enough to the st mitchel metro, which gives you access to the entire city. Access to Netflix was a plus! Therese’s list of places to see came very handy. I give the place 5 stars!","9"
"Very handy for the metro, and a parking space is very much appreciated!","9"
"Rien à dire sur le logement ! Au top","9"
"The private apartment was perfect for us. The parking space was a great bonus but even if you don't drive the subway is just around the corner, as are lots of markets and restaurants.

Everything was sparkling clean and as described / shown in the pictures. The building and area were very quiet at night. Although it is not in the heart of downtown, it took no more than 15 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go. Having the smart TV with Netflix was better than cable. The bed was super comfortable as was the living room. 

Check-in and checkout was easy and convenient.","9"
"Therese is fantastic. The stay was great and we were very pleased.","9"
"Logement très correct, propre, pratique. Cage d’escalier un peu encombrée. Quartier correct, bien que quelqu’un ait uriné sur notre voiture garée dehors.","9"

Therese lives in the apartment next door and is available, and responded to our emails promptly before our arrival. I really recommend this apartment and would use it again!","9"
"Therese’s apartment is extremely  clean and comfortable. Just a couple of minutes walk from the metro which connects you to anywhere in the city. The neighbourhood is quiet, check-in was super easy and it was great to have the free parking space right next to the building. Definitely recommend!","9"
"Clean and nice place.","9"
"This place was just what we needed in Montreal. A super nice apartment, the cleanest I have ever seen. All the amenities you would ever need. Its in a super quiet and small building so you don't need to worry about noise. A quick 10 minute walk to the subway so Montreal is at your fingertips. The parking spot was a huge bonus and made our life stress free since we had to drive into Montreal. Therese and her family were also super nice and very responsive. Will definitely stay here again when I go to Montreal.","9"
"I would have book again!","9"
"I truly enjoyed my stay.  I strongly recommend Therese place to anyone who's looking for a full house in this area. Very clean, cozy atmosphere and quiet. It also comes with a private parking space which made it very convenient during our stay.","9"
"Therese’s place was great! Very clean and had everything we needed for our short stay here. The parking spot and smart TV with Netflix was awesome too! The grocery store “Esposito” was close by and the “St. Michel” metro station was less than a 5 minute walk away, letting us travel all around Montreal quickly and cheaply. Each room had its own thermostat too which was helpful while staying here in the cold winter months. This apartment was on the third floor so just something to be aware of if anyone has ambulatory issues! Overall an awesome experience and would return here again in the future! Thank you Therese!","9"
"Therese’s home is an excellent place to stay if you are driving to Montreal or renting a car. The parking spot made our stay hassle free and the drive to Downtown and Old Montreal was quick.

"Tristan was an excellent host and has created a wonderful space for visitors. Prior to arriving, Tristan was very prompt in responding to my messages and extremely communicative in arranging arrival plans, keys/parking/etc. Tristan greeted us and directed us to the private parking for the apartment, in the rain!!! He was very sweet upon meeting us and walked through the apartment with us as well, making sure we had everything we needed for our stay. During our stay, I had a few questions, he was always available to answer via txt and even coming up to the apartment. 

The space itself is immaculate. Brand new. Amazing shower, comfortable beds, fresh linens, ample space in closets, plenty of towels, kitchen supplies, everything stocked. Simple, yet very thoughtful. Everything you need. 

Thank you Tristan! ","10"

All of my guests loved it as well and we all agree that we would love to stay at Tristan's again!","10"

I would definitely come back.","10"
"Well located and a parking space in the back alley.
Minimalist decor, which I liked.
2 big bedrooms. Very clean. No TV, but Wifi available.

Nice bakery and convenience store at the corner.
Parc Molson is very nice and a cinema with répertoire movies.

idéal pour une famille qui veut explorer tous les charmes de Montréal (Marché Jean Talon, Little Italy, downtown...)","10"
"Quiet, residential area close to cafes and a few restaurants. The place was spacious for 2 people, very clean and stylish. Our stay there was super comfortable. The host was really welcoming and friendly! Would definitely recommend.","10"
"First and foremost it was a great pleasure dealing with the host, Karen, who went out of her way to make our stay comfortable. She provided many great tips on restaurants, and transit providing us with a print copy of Metro stations nearby.  The unit was ample size for us two but would accommodate four guests comfortably. The bed was very comfortable. This unit is definitely as advertised, and we second all the great reviews for this location.  We would definitely stay here again and hope to come back soon. Thanks Karen!","10"
"Great place in a quiet neighborhood. Check in was easy and Karen was helpful with tips to get around. Private parking was right out back, very convenient.","10"
"Had a great stay. Perfect location. Would definitely recommend this place.","10"

"Près du parc Molson et de la rue Beaubien, cet appartement est bien situé. Multiples cafés, bistros à 5min de marche. ","10"
"Great apartment! Absolutely no complaints during our stay :) would stay there again. Thanks Tristan!","10"
"Pros:
-- In a nice area close to many restaurants and cafes
-- About 25 min walk to main Subway/metro station
-- Super clean place
-- Easy check-in/out

Cons:
-- No air conditioning, provided a fan ( but only 1 fan when there are 2 bedrooms)
-- No TV 
-- Internet went out a few times during our stay
-- Walls thin can hear neighbours walking around upstairs at all times
-- Bathroom door sticks and quite hard to open/close 

Overall, a nice basic place without the bells and whistles.","10"
"We really enjoyed our time in Tristan's place! It is situated on a nice residential street but is a very close walk to coffee shops, the cinema, grocery stores as well as other bars and restaurants. The space itself was clean and had some nice minimalistic touches that we liked. We really liked to come back in the afternoon to chat and have coffee in the common areas.","10"
"Fantastic apartment in a great neighborhood. It’s bigger than it looks in the pictures! It’s close to little shops and restaurants, but even better is that it’s near a really accessible thoroughfare that makes it really easy to use public transit to get to their areas of the city. Tristan and Karen are super communicative and make the whole process super easy and comfortable.","10"
"Très bon accueil. Appartement lumineux et spacieux.
Je recommande vivement cet appartement","10"
"Appartement spacieux, propre et bien équipé. 
Literie confortable et salle de bain moderne. Un peu loin (15-20 min) du métro mais proche des bus. 
Quartier agréable et vivant. De nombreux restaurants et magasins d'alimentation à proximité. Place de parc privée très pratique. 
Tristant est réactif et arrangeant, très bon contact avec lui.  
Le quartier est calme mais on ne peut pas en profiter totalement car l'isolation phonique à l'intérieur de l'appartement est vraiment mauvaise. Difficile de fermer l'oeil tant (ou dès) que le voisin du dessus est actif tant les craquements du plancher sont présents dans tout l'appartement, dommage car tout le reste est au top !!","10"
"Appartement agréable dans un quartier calme très bien situé. Très bon accueil","10"
"Un appartement dans un quartier très sympa avec tous les commerces nécessaires à proximité, une station de métro située à 15 à minutes à pieds (ligne bleue - Arrêt d’Iberville) permettant d’accéder au cœur de Montréal sans souci. Tristan est un hôte très réactif, qui habite avec sa famille dans l’appartement en-dessous donc une sécurité supplémentaire au besoin. Si je suis amené à revenir sur Montréal, nul doute que je solliciterai à nouveau Tristan qui mérite son statut de Superhost !","10"
"great comfy place!","10"
"Logement très agréable
Idéal pour 2 couples","10"
"This is a very cute apartment great for groups! My friends and I enjoyed using this place as a home base during our trip to Montreal. One thing you should consider (if using a car in the winter) is asking if parking will be available before you arrive. Since parking was in the title of the listing, I assumed we would have parking during our stay. Yet, the parking spot was not cleared when we got to the AirBnB. We were eventually allowed to park in the neighbor's spot. I recommend just asking before you arrive if off-street parking will be available during your trip.","10"
"Perfect","10"
"L'appart est très fonctionnel : il y a tout ce qu'il faut pour cuisiner, la cuisine est très grande, la sdb parfaitement propre, le lit douillet et le petit salon, quoiqu'un peu sombre, agréable. Il y a même une petite cour derrière avec petite table et deux chaises. Super sympa pour être à l'air et au calme. 

La rue Drolet est très jolie, fleurie, calme, il y a un dépanneur juste au coin de la rue, pratique. Et surtout dès que vous marchez 3/4 minutes, vous rejoignez la rue Duluth, le bd saint laurent et st denis où la vie reprend, dans les bars, restos, terrasses... 

Le quartier du plateau est vivant, mais attendez vous à croiser des français partout où vous allez :)

En tout cas n'hésitez pas à réserver ici, votre séjour sera idéal et Sarah et Aristide sont adorables, disponibles et arrangeants.","10"
"It was a really beautiful space, you could tell the hosts put alot of thought into decorating and furnishing the place because you had everything you could possibly need (including cooking spices, tea and coffee). It was clean, quiet and very well located. Sarah and Aristide were lovely to meet. I was really happy with the accommodation. ","10"
"It's exactly as pictured. I was SUPER comfortable during my stay and it has so much character. The perfect little place to stay when you come to Montreal.","10"
"Sharah & Aristide are very nice people. They provide a lot in this space. Fully equiped kitchen, bathroom had shampoo and body wash, umbrellas in case of rain, fans and spare sheets and pillows in the bedroom. This place is great for the value. You're so close to many great restaurants and boutiques. I would gladly stay again!","10"
"A very cute rustic home :) really enjoyed our stay!","10"
"Great place with a lot of character, amazing location, and a super comfortable bed! Loved our stay here, and the hosts were very helpful and flexible. Highly recommended!","10"
"Great location, half underground so nice and cool in the summer time. Super clean and very cool.","10"
"Great place in a great location. Sarah was very responsive and helpful with any questions I had both leading up to my stay and during my stay. Also, the location is perfect - walking distance to many restaurants and bars and also well connected via metro. The place itself is clean, spacious and quite large. Definitely recommend.","10"
"Sarah and Aristide's self-contained apartment was wonderful. Clean, homely, with access to a beautiful garden and within easy walking distance from a host of beautiful buildings, hundreds of murals, and super independent restaurants, bars and coffee houses. After 13 hours of travel, it was wonderful to sink into a bath in this rustic building in a quiet street. I heartily recommend this place to stay for a happy, chilled out stay, as well as Sarah and Aristide as warm, accommodating hosts.","10"
"Sarah and Aristide were great hosts, and the room was especially cozy, and quiet. A very cool location, highly recommend staying in Le Plateau if you haven't been to that part of town, 10-20 minute walk or an 8 minute drive to Main Streets such as St Laurent and St. Catherine.","10"
"We loved our stay in Sarah's apartment! It is close to several types of public transportation and within walking distance of many restaurants and shops. The apartment itself was very clean and full of useful accommodations. Sarah was very thoughtful and quick in her communications. We would stay here again and recommend to anyone!","10"
"GREAT location and value. Close to lots of good shopping, metro, schwartz's and mount royal. We were able to walk everywhere (longer walks but quite doable) as this place is well located to many of the popular sites and great food! The space is very clean, comfortable and stocked with nice ""extras"" like fresh coffee and tea. Sarah and Aristide were lovely hosts, very open and accommodating, ready to answer all questions and help out with anything in the apartment. Overall, we had a great time and would book here again because of the great hosts and lovely, comfortable, home-like space.","10"
"Après une expérience ratée dans un logement d'étudiant délabré dans le ""ghetto McGill"", nous avons eu le plaisir de passer 2 nuits dans le charmant appartement de Sarah et Aristide sur le Plateau, un contraste total! L'endroit, à deux pas du square St-Louis et des rues St-Denis et St-Laurent, figure un quartier tranquille et charmant, où il fait bon vivre, où les enfants dépassent en nombre les autos... Les maisons ont toutes un charme certain, dans leur style urbain de début du XXe. L'appartement mis à disposition par Sarah et Aristide se trouve sous leur logement - de sorte qu'on peut résoudre immédiatement toute question avec eux - au rez-de-chaussée de leur maison. Tout y est charmant, des murs en brique au sol en parquet (et en pente!) au mobilier cosy et fonctionnel à la fois. On y loge aisément à 3 grâce au fauteuil convertible en lit dans le petit salon. Et l'appartement permet aussi d'y cuisiner et d'y manger. Un très bon choix !","10"
"I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun getaway in Montreal. It is conveniently located in the middle of a hip neighborhood filled with great restaurants and coffee shops. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating, and the apartment was neat, clean, and overall attended to my everyday needs.","10"
"Endroit charmant et très bien situé.
Le logement est correct. Cosy, propre.  Aristide et Sarah sont accueillants.
Très agréable","10"
"Excellent place to stay. The space was clean and spacious enough for 2-3 people. The metro is a very short walk away and a bike rental(bixi) station is just at the end of the street. Very quiet neighbourhood. I would have zero hesitations staying here again!","10"
"Très bon logement bien equipe et bien situe 
Je recommande ce logement","10"
"Cute space, cozy and just the right size for two.  Our visit coincided with an unprecedented Montréal heat wave, but the apartment was always cool and pleasant to return to.  With the windows open, there's some playground, household and neighborhood noise during the day, but perfectly quiet at night.  Easy and charming walk to great restaurants in the neighborhood.","10"
"Highly recommended, charming spot. Great location only a short walk to the Metro and a great restaurant/bar Else's, amongst others. Easy check in and out and great communication.","10"
"Lovely little apartment, very very clean and quiet. 
Sarah and Aristide are very friendly and helpfull. 
I definitely recommend this sweet apartment.","10"
"Comfortable, clean & well-maintained apartment in a quiet residential area, not far from great restaurants. Sarah & Aristide responded quickly to text messages.  Apartment is a ~30 minute walk to old town Montreal, McGill University and the fine arts museum; and ~60 minutes walk to a large open-air farmers market in Little Italy area of town.","10"
"Super logement! 
Très bien placé: à proximité du métro Sherbrooke. Mont royal à 10-15min à pied. 
Très facile de communiquer avec Sarah Et Aristide!! Réponse immédiate par email avec réponses à toutes nos Questions. 
Logement très agréable, équipements au top Et propreté impeccable! 
Je recommande!","10"
"Logement très agréable. J'adore le bois verni avec cette couleur dorée, je trouve ça chaleureux ! Logement très calme : très peu de passage dans la rue et en plus, on est un peu en retrait. Comme dans toutes les constructions de ce type, on entend facilement les bruits de pas au-dessus, mais heureusement, cela ne dure pas bien tard. Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de profiter de l'arrière-cour. J'ai néanmoins particulièrement apprécié le nid douillet, la cuisine spacieuse, le bain pour relaxer et les serviettes bien agréables. J'ai eu aussi la chance de trouver une place de stationnement libre juste en face de l'appartement. J'ai pu ainsi laisser la voiture tout le week-end et aller en centre-ville grâce au métro (la station Sherbrooke est à 600m). Bref, très bonne expérience. Je recommande !","10"
"What a wonderful place to stay whilst travelling in montreal. 
It is perfect for one person, suitable for two. Also so very close to all that
you could want to see in Montreal. Tons of nice cafes on St. Denis for anyone looking to work, and a veryyy comfortable bed. Pleasure to communicate with 
and very prompt response. Thank you Sarah & Aristide!","10"
"This is a wonderfully compact, reasonable priced,  and ideally located apartment for visiting Montreal. The street is quiet but walking distance from great restaurants, parks and the metro. After a full day of walking, I appreciated the comfortable queen bed with duel reading lights..  Sarah and Aristide are responsive hosts,  and thoughtfully stock the kitchen with fresh coffee.  If you are arriving by car, make sure to get precise info regarding the free street parking - the signage system in Montreal  is unique, and parking tickets costly!","10"
"We had a lovely stay at Sarah's flat. The neighborhood is absolutely charming, and pretty walkable to everything we wanted to do and see (put on about 10 miles/day) but in the lovely fall weather and cute streets of the neighborhood and city we didn't mind walking at all!

Sarah was so friendly and quick to reply to all of our messages - offering suggestions on best places to thrift shop, and tips on finding a free parking spot for the weekend. Definitely appreciated!

The flat itself was very clean and pretty big - had everything my fiance and I needed; with a very comfortable bed I may add! The only small bump in our stay is that I believe Sarah and Aristide have a small child/children who we heard running around every morning at 7:30/8AM. We love kids, and have a few nieces and nephews ourselves, so we totally understand that they have a LOT of energy in the morning - but a heads up for people who like sleeping in late - this wasn't a huge issue for us as we are fairly early risers, but just worth noting. 

Overall - great first time to Montreal! Would love to come back someday!","10"
"Aristide s'est montré très accueillant et attentif. Les informations données concernant notre arrivée étaient précises et facilitantes. Les lieux sont propres et chaleureux. Quelques jeux de société sont mis à la disposition des visiteurs, nous avons bien apprécié le jeu de mémoire plutôt original! L'appartement est on ne peut mieux bien situé.","10"
"Great location, friendly hosts","10"
"Excellente communication, logement propre, confortable et chaleureux.  Hautement  recommandé.","10"
"The hosts were very helpful, especially in accommodating our needs for our toddler. They were easy to communicate with, and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Great price for the location and amenities.  Awesome little place to stay, we walked nearly everywhere for what we wanted to do in Montreal.  Previous reviews were accurate about the noise, you can definitely hear the kids upstairs in the AM, but we were out and about the majority of our stay.","10"
"Sarah and Aristide's apartment was super cute and even larger than it appears in the pictures. The bed was super comfy, everything was spotless and there was coffee and tea for the morning. Communication was great and the directions for all the available parking were concise and easy to follow. I loved the neighborhood and the apartment is close to all sorts of cool restaurants, cafes and bars. Would love to stay here again!","10"
"Excellent location and very nice space for two people. Clean throughout and very comfortable bed. Coffee and tea available which we enjoyed very much. If it is dark out when you arrive, watch for the stairs into the home as they begin quickly. We loved our stay and sincerely hope to be back!","10"
"This is a great, garden-level apartment in the Plateau-Mont-Royal neighborhood. If you enjoy exploring cities by foot, this is perfectly situated near Mile End, Mont-Royal, Boulevard St Laurent, Rue Saint-Denis and so much more. It's also a quick walk to the Sherbrooke metro station and you are surrounded by bus routes, making the entire city very accessible. The neighborhood is fairly quiet, safe and very charming. Highly recommend if you prefer to stay in a neighborhood vs the bustle of downtown.","10"
"The space was clean and comfortable, exactly what we hoped for! Thanks for a great night ","10"
"Great place to stay while in Montreal! Apartment is cozy, clean, and in an excellent location.","10"
"Sarah and Aristide's place was a fantastic home base for our Montreal visit: very clean and cozy (even in a particularly frigid January), great neighborhood, and easy access to the rest of the city via transit. S+A were extremely responsive and accommodating despite being out of town while we were there.","10"
"It is definitely cute and quirky.  The floor is very uneven -- we kept jamming our toes.  The drain in the bath doesn't work very well.  In winter months, it is cold and draughty.","10"
"Real authentic cozy Montreal Plateau apartment. Was exactly what we were looking for, great location and easy access. Would come back again!","10"
"The apartment was in the perfect location for walking to Rue Saint-Laurent and was clean and very cozy. Sarah and Aristide left very detailed instructions for everything. The only minor issue we had was with parking, but with a quick trip around the block we found a spot. We will definitely book again if we are ever in Montreal!","10"
"Great apartment, very clean with lots of nice touches. Communication was really easy and the hosts were great. One of the best air bnb's I've ever stayed  at.","10"
"Appartement très bien tenu dans un quartier calme mais vivant et dans une jolie rue avec belles maisons colorées :) 
Sarah et Aristide ont été réactifs et très arrangeants, notamment pour la fin de séjour.

"Sarah and Aristide's place was lovely - cute, clean and cozy. Had a great stay and the place was great location wise, pretty much walked everywhere from there. Would recommend and hope to be able to stay again in the future!","10"
"Logement très agréable et très tranquille sur le plateau, le bus et le métro sont juste à côté . Je recommande fortement","10"
"Muy buen lugar. Amplio, cómodo y limpio, tal cual descripto en la foto. En pleno Plateau con todos sus bares y lugares de comida, hay un subte cerca para ir al centro de Montreal. No conocí a los anfitriones pero la comunicación fue fluida. Recomendado 100%.","10"
"Sarah & Aristide were super helpful from the get-go. We received a note upon our arrival of what to expect when we reached the apartment, along with guidelines of where to park -Montreal street signs can be a little tricky. The apartment itself was very clean, cozy and has lots of character. The interior brick walls were a nice touch, the floors were a little uneven in certain areas - we got used to it fairly quickly and it definitely added to the rustic feel of the apartment. It is also in a great location - close to various cafes, shops, and in the middle of two main streets. The kitchen was stocked with the essentials for cooking - as well as coffee and tea which is always a plus. Internet was easy to connect to and very fast - there was also a small, yet loud, stereo system available for use in the living room. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend!","10"
"Sarah and Aristide were kind and gracious hosts. They were very caring to ensure we had a pleasant stay. Thanks for everything!","10"
"Sarah and Aristide's place is a great location!  It was about a 10 min walk to the Metro and lots of places around for eating and shopping.  I loved that it didn't have a TV, but offered WiFi to check in with our family in the US.  We hope to back to Montreal very soon.","10"
"I had a great stay at Sarah and Aristide's place. The apartment was super clean and really nicely decorated, with lovely creaky wooden floors that made me feel as if I was in a log cabin. The place was perfect for my brief stay in Montreal - comfy bed, nice big kitchen space with a dining table, and on a quiet street though centrally located (nearest metro station is less than a ten minute walk).

Communication was always quick. Wifi is great. Check-in and out all very smooth.

All in all I highly recommend the apartment! Thanks again Sarah and Aristide.","10"
"The apartment was well located within walking distance to many shops and short drives to various spots in Montreal. The only slight concern was that any small footsteps from anyone upstairs was clearly heard in the apartment below, but that did not negatively impact our experience overall.","10"
"The place was great and only a few minutes walk to the metro. We arrived a little earlier than expected and they kindly let us drop off our luggages so we didn’t need to carry them around :) lots of thoughtful thinking by the host! Definitely recommended!","10"
"Sarah & Aristide's home was a great getaway in the middle of a great area of Montreal. There is plenty to do nearby and it is roughly a 10 minute walk to Laurent. The space itself was clean, good for 2-3 people, might be a little cramped for more than that. Street parking was available but is limited due to residential permits being required for a majority of the spots, so be mindful of the spaces. As hosts, they we're very responsive and accommodating to my needs.","10"
"Très beau logement aménagé avec goût.  Quartier magnifique et très calme. Une très belle étape","10"

We definitely recommend this place for your stay in Montréal!","10"
"Très joli appartement avec beaucoup de cachet. Il est idéalement situé pour visiter Montréal.

Je conseille vivement.","10"
"Appartement magnifique, emplacement parfait, superbe jardin. Je recommande vivement","10"
"Our hosts were very quick to respond to our concerns and made us feel very welcomed. We had a brief issue with the hot water but otherwise the space was really wonderful. It’s an old space on the ground floor so we knew coming in we’d be able to hear the occupants from upstairs so it didn’t bother us. Very walkable to downtown and the surrounding area was close to great food shops. We definitely have no regrets about staying there and I’d definitely recommend this space to any friends interested in visiting montreal.","10"

"Super clean, comfortable, exactly as described. Great neighbourhood. Lovely hosts! Highly recommend!","10"
"My partner and I had a wonderful time staying at Sarah and Aristide's place. The apartment was cute and very clean, with everything we needed for our four-night stay. The neighborhood is charming, and the location was perfect--close to both Mount Royale and La Fontaine parks, and to too much good beer and coffee for us to exhaust in one trip. Exactly what we were hoping for!","10"
"Sarah & Aristide were always available and returned my messages promptly; they allowed me to stay a bit beyond check out time so I didn’t have such a long wait at the airport.","10"

"Excellent place for a couple who wants to rest and enjoy tranquility in the middle of Plateau Mont-Royal!","10"
"This 1 BRoom spot is great, Lots happening in the area and easy walking to and from. House had lots of amenities and the owners attention to detail is fantastic. Communication although not used very much was top notch. ","10"
"The apartment is very comfortable and has a pleasing rustic vibe. The location of the apartment is PERFECT. Around the corner there is a bicycle rental station if you prefer cycling. There is a busy street with plenty of great restaurants. Nearby there are also a variety of very good bars nestled in side streets. Lastly, within a quarter mile, there is a boulevard with vibrant nightlife and restaurants. I can’t imagine staying anywhere else during my next visit to Montreal","10"

"Beautiful private small apartment, with unique local architecture. Centrally located. ","10"
"Beautiful cosy character apartment.  Everything looks as is, super clean and great layout. The location is awesome close to great locations and metro yet not busy at the same time which is nice to relax. Sarah & Aristide communicated with me as needed. If I had any question they were prompt to respond. Overall I would recommend their place. Great host and hospitable. ","10"
"Nous avons bien apprécié notre séjour à Montréal dans ce jolie appartement.  La localisation était parfaite et répondait grandement à nos attentes. J'ai bien aimé la porte de jardin qui nous donnait accès à une belle petite ruelle tellement typique du plateau. Ma plus grande crainte était le stationnement, mais suite aux explications précises, nous en avons facilement trouvé un tout prêt de l’appartement pour toute la durée de notre séjour. J'ai également trouvé très sympathique Aristide qui s'est s'informé à savoir si j'appréciais mon séjour et m'a même offert de partir un peu plus tard que prévu, si je le désirais. Pour toutes ses raisons, un gros merci  !","10"
"Sarah and Aristide’s place is ideal for a couple visiting Montreal. It is cute, homely, and centrally located in a great neighbourhood. Parking is somewhat difficult, but Sarah and Aristide were very helpful in orienting us and helping us find where to go. ","10"
"What a place! It was close to downtown and smack dab in the middle of what became our favorite neighborhood in Montreal. It's close to all sorts of shops, restaurants, and mount Royale. The only tricky thing is parking, but Sarah helped us out, we had a trailer with a couple scooters on it and we were able to get parking for both nights so it all worked out wonderfully. We would definitely stay here again.","10"
"This B&B is very well located at the centre of Le plateau.
However you can hear a lot of noise of kids running around above. ","10"

"Sarah and Aristide's apartment was perfect for a short stay in Montréal, placed in a quiet neighborhood close to some great parts of the city. Also, Mont Royal is in reasonable distance for a nice afternoon walk. 
The apartment itself is very cosy with its wooden floors and the low front door. Super clean, and has everything you need and then some.","10"
"AMAZING place to stay. Prime location - calm neighborhood (but not at all boring), close to everything, with some nicest restaurants around (Café Névé was my favorite!). Apartment was charming and very comfortable. All in all, five stars! A great value, especially for short vacations in Montreal.","10"

"Apartment is exactly as described in the post. The hosts took an extra step and helped us find parking the evening we arrived. They were available but not at all intrusive. The apartment was clean and cozy. Bed was very comfy and shower had good pressure. The best part was the location. A quiet street in the middle of a wonderful neighborhood. There were plenty of restaurants and areas to explore within walking distance. It was very safe. Just one block down there was even a playground for children and in the opposite direction an elementary school. Next time we are in Montreal, we hope to stay here again.","10"

The studio was really comfortable and perfectly located - we were close to all the sites and good places to eat, but the street was still quiet and comfortable and private.  The hosts were really great to spend time with too - I felt like we were meeting as old friends after a few minutes of conversation and they were really accommodating.  We loved staying here!!","10"

Its also super close to both the green and orange metro lines. Despite being so close to such a bustling area, it is also so quiet and secluded.  Marina’s place was also very clean and provided everything you need. Check in and check out were very easy, and Marina was quick to respond to messages. We would definitely stay again!","10"

This location was the best and convenient. It was only steps away from the metro station and steps away from St Catherine which had so many different cafes and restaurants to choose from. The evening is always so lively. Marina's place was very very clean and tidy. Marina was very fast at responding to any concerns I had. Marina was very flexible with my stay when I told her about my late check in and late check out. I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely come back and stay at Marina's place again. ","10"

"Fantastic location; convenient and easy access to restaurants, cafes, and bars in the Village. Grocery and bodega nearby when you want to use the kitchen in the apartment. Close to Metro and other transit. The apartment itself is located on a quiet side street; great haven in the midst of a fun urban area. Will book again for future visits to Montreal.","10"
"Marina's place is a PERFECT location for staying in Montreal.  It's great because you get to stay in a classic Montreal building and you're a block away from Saint-Catherine St.  The metro is a really short walk and it really helps to get around the city.  The place itself was spotless when I walked in, and really comfortable for 1 or 2 people.  The bed was comfy, I slept well every night.  The shower is great with good water pressure, same with the sink.  The front door takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it you'll be ok.  I would definitely stay there again.  Great location, price, and clean.","10"
"The apartment is on a quiet, one- way street with a serene yard in the back, even though it is close to dynamic Montreal activities,","10"
"Marina's place is in a PERFECT location less than a block from St. Catherine Street. It is easy walking to all the sights and districts in the city and close to the subway. It's a large, comfortable flat with a big bathroom and huge patio. Easy check-in. Responsive host. It was a bit tricky with the window configuration to get cool, fresh air on Montreal's warmest summer days/nights. All in all, an exceptional value. I would absolutely return.","10"

"Pour nos trois premiers jours au Canada nous avions réservé l'appartement de Marina. On ne pouvait pas mieux tomber ! C'est un petit appartement cocoon, très chaleureux, entièrement équipé et très bien situé dans une rue calme à une centaine de mètres de la rue principale du quartier du Village, très beau quartier et très animé.
Durant notre séjour, Marina a été une hôte parfaite, très à l'écoute et extrêmement réactive. Nous avons eu des petits problèmes de plomberie un soir. Marina a tout de suite appelé un plombier pour qu'il vienne nous dépanner dès le lendemain matin et nous a même offert un petit cadeau local pour se faire pardonner du désagrément.
En résumé, un séjour parfait qui nous a paru trop court !","10"

"100% description accuracy. Didn't get to meet the host but the room and the apartment were very comfy and nice. It's like one block away from the train station so you can go anywhere very easily and also very close to the Mount Royal, park La Fountaine. Just in front of my room was a coffee shop, ice cream, restaurants, bars, and shops. Stayed here the last days of my trip so I was resting most of the time but again, super comfortable place. Would definitely recommend Craig's place! ","10"

"Located just five minute's walk from a major bus artery and from there only a 5min ride to the Blue Line (Metro), Paschale and Julien's home is the perfect base-camp for families looking to explore Montreal and return to a quiet neighborhood at night. 

While located within a 20min drive of all major attractions, we parked the van for three solid days and explored the city via public transit and on foot. Within a 7min walk of the home is a Provigo (chain mid-range grocery) two large parks with wading pools, tennis courts, basketball and baseball spaces, and even publicly available piano to play. Near one park is a fantastic breakfast place and a row of shops on Rue Beaubien including artisianal cheese and meat shops. So you needn't travel far to live like a native and entertain the children.

The home itself easily sleeps 7 (we were 5 including 3 children ages 7 to 12) and provides adequate cooking, dining, and sitting space. Clean, bright, and cozy, we felt right at home. 

Situated on the main/basement floors of a 3-storey walk-up, the main floor features three bedrooms and an office we repurposed as a fourth bedroom, using the trundle bed from one of the children's bedrooms. No air-conditioning, but the windows and fans proved more than adequate for the mild weather this week (no highs above 28C).

The bathrooms are nice, especially the newly remodelled basement bath with walk-in shower and attractive vanity. The basement also provides another bedroom and a sitting area with couch and futon facing a large TV; a comfortable space that could easily sleep two.

We are sorry our trip had to end. We would gladly stay here again. So glad we found this spot and hosts!","10"
"Karim gave clear and thorough instructions prior to our visit. Though we never needed to meet in person or speak over the phone, he was very friendly and helpful, and eager to make our stay as comfortable as possible. 

Use of the squash court was a bonus. ","9"
"Tidy and comfortable apartment with all the essentials and good shower pressure. The futon bed was comfortable. The dedicated secure undercover carpark was great. Short walking distance of downtown and the major city attractions. Karim was very responsive and a pleasure to communicate with. Would happily stay in the apartment  again if ever back in Montreal.","9"
"The place was very clean and cozy. 5 mins walk from St Catherine St. Very communicative and responsive with me. I will recommend it for sure to other guest visiting Montreal!","9"
"The place was very clean and the location was amazing.  The only challenge was the pool was closed for renovations during our stay.","9"
"Host was very accommodating for our last minute late night check in. Parking garage was kind of tight, definitely would be a squish for a mid sized car. But aside from that, Appartment was a lot more spacious than expected :) very cute decore and extremely convienent location ! ","9"
"Great location. Walking distance to pretty much everything.","9"
"We had a great stay! The place is just as pictured very comfortable & clean. I didn't get a chance to meet Karim but he provided detailed information on how to check in, park and check out. The place is at a very convenient location - close to restaurants, bars, shopping and metro. Would definitely recommend and come back. ","9"

"Karim was an excellent host.  Gave us accurate directions and instructions.  Flat is located perfectly in walking distance (or metro) of all downtown action.  We love to walk everywhere as Montreal is a walkable city but had no issue with Uber and taxis.  Did not take advantage of the pool due to limited time but it is amazing along with the rooftop patio.  Had no issues with loud neighbors and building is relatively quiet.","9"
"Karim's apartment is awesome! Fit 5 of us comfortably. Karim offered some great local recommendations and was really helpful and responsive. The location is within walking distance from a lot of cool restaurants and bars. There's a lot of shopping on Sainte Catherine which is right down the street. It's also a cheap taxi ride away from the water front and Mount Royal. Would definitely recommend this place!","9"
"The apartment is  almost exactly as described. It's not fancy, but you will have everything you need. The beds are all futons, even in the bedroom. It's well stocked, very clean and comfortable.  Parking situation is wonderful. Location is wonderful. Karim was very responsive and helpful.","9"

"L'appartement est sympathique mais le ménage laisse vraiment à désirer .... Draps avec des taches, poussière un peu partout ... Dommage au prix de la nuit on s'attendait à quelque chose de propre.","9"
"Karim's place was sizable, but also very basic. It's use is clearly for Airbnb's only, so it felt a bit bare. Lacked small details like a full length mirror and paper towels. We also ran out of toilet paper (we were 2 women, stayed for 5 days, and there were 2 very small rolls when we got there). As for location, it was very close to the metro. The parking spot was clutch. We ended up not using our car at all (walked/took metro). As a side note, if you are sensitive to cigarette smell be aware that the hallways do have a strong odor. The apartment itself had none, but there were a lot of cigarette butts on the patio. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to check out the pool. Overall we were satisfied with our stay.","9"
"Everything was perfect. Karim explained the check in process effectively and we enjoyed our stay. There was no hassle and the location was everything we wanted and more.","9"

It is very convenient to find meals (Japanese, Korean, Indian, Chinese, Spanish, Steakhouse, Vietnamese) it is close to University and college so transportation and restaurant are very easy reach.","9"
"Just as listed, I wouldn't say dirty but wasn't the cleanest place ever.
The terrace and building amenities where amazing! Enjoyed my stay. 
Worth it for the price. Thanks Karim!","9"
"Great location - very near to metro station, which can be used to access most attractions in Montreal. The parking space is a bonus. Karim sent a detailed and easy to follow check-in procedures. He even helped to set up the sofa bed with pillows and blankets prior to our arrival. Thank you!","9"

"Karim's place is at a very vibrant neighbourhood. There are lots of good restaurants nearby. It is of walking distance to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts as well. He also provides guide books in his place, which turned out to be very helpful. Karim gives detailed instructions, so it is easy to locate the apartment. Overall, it was a good experience.","9"

"Karim went out of his way on his weekend to make sure we were happy! He always text back within minutes and was very flexible. We showed up three hours earlier then check in, and Karim made it work so we could park our car in the free parking zone, and drop off our bags. I would highly recommend his condo! Comfortable, clean and great location! Thanks again for a great weekend in Montreal!","9"

"Great location downtown near Mont Royal and Ste. Catherine, awesome amenities, great price, and Karim was accurate and responsive!","9"
"Karim's place was exactly what we needed-- a quiet haven in the heart of Montreal. The apartment had what was needed for our group of five. Not fancy but definitely serviceable and (again) the location was wonderful! The rooftop access, pool and parking made it even better. A short walk to so many great city spots! We had a wonderful weekend there! Thank you, Karim!","9"

"Pretty nice! Good place with excellent location! Since I stayed here during Christmas holiday, one point is that the temperature is pretty low, not warm at all. Overall, it’s pretty great!","9"
"My boyfriend and I enjoyed Karim’s place very much. Super close to the green line Guy-Concordia metro station to get around the city. We kept our car parked in Karim’s parking space. The parking is tight, but doable. We did a 3-day unlimited Metro pass that was only $18 CAD, which was perfect in getting us anywhere we needed to be from Karim’s. Karim was very quick to respond and helped us out with a last minute booking after our previous booking got canceled on us. Highly recommend and would definitely stay at his place again!","9"
"Bien situé, propre, bonne communication, stationnement interieur*****","9"
"This apartment is centrally located with decent indoor parking. However, it is poorly maintained and missing a few amenities in the kitchen. The accumulation of dirt and dust over the year is obvious on furniture and baseboards with stains on walls and doors. The worst is to be charged a cleaning fee and to then be handed a dirty apartment that was not properly cleaned after the previous night's guest. From a stinky towel and dirty bathroom to dirty sinks and filthy countertops and stovetop. I would not stay here again.","9"
"The condo located in Downtown Montreal, where is convenient to access everywhere such as Metro, stores, cafe, express food, etc. Check in and Check out procedure is easy.  ","9"
"Great communication with Karim. 8th floor apt centrally located so you can walk everywhere. Metro just a block away.
Indoor parking a plus as was the small pool and sauna. Apt was nice and quiet and clean. Futon mattresses rather hard and anyone with chemical sensitivity would notice the spray air freshener odor","9"
"Karim's place is awesome. Great location, ease of checking in and out, very spacious, and access to an indoor pool which was very unexpected. Thanks again!","9"
"Arriver simple , réponse rapide 
Appartement très bien situer , complet 
Rien à dire !!!","9"
"We were very happy with our stay. The room was exactly or better than advertised, and the amenities in the building were great (though the squash court seems to actually be a racquetball court). The location is fantastic - about a 10 minute walk from nightlife at Crescent street - and included parking is a huge plus. While we did not meet Karim in person, he was very responsive to our messages and the Argentinian steakhouse suggested in the listing was fantastic.","9"
"Karim's place is a great! Everything is as described and its a great location close to the subway and st. Catherine street.  Karim is also super quick to respond. The only issue we had was that there wasn't enough toilet paper and we had to go buy more. There also was 4 of us but we only had 2 towels. Overall it was an amazing stay and we would stay here again.","9"
"Awesome location, I had a great weekend at Karim’s place!","9"
"We stayed in Montreal for the long weekend. Our stay was amazing. Karim was quick with his responses and everything was as described.","9"
"Karim is an excellent host and very responsive to messaging. His directions for check-in, etc. were very clear and helpful.

The place has everything you need. However, the on-site parking has a max 5’7” clearance, so don’t count on free parking if you have a truck, suv or minivan. 

The building is easy to find and conveniently located within the city.","9"
"We really had a great weekend in Montreal staying in this place. Pool and sauna are extra enjoyable part of our stay, parking is tight but manageable. The unit is nice and clean.

"Perfect !","9"
"really good place but becareful with the underground parking","9"
"The apartment is in a perfect location. 3 minutes walking from saint catherine with is a really nice street and location. However the apartment is really old, not clean at all and the smell in the entire building is really nasty. I had to ask the owner to come and clean the apartment again because I could not stay there. I sent her picture of the floor and the stains. They came again to clean however the stains and dust were still there. I had to clean them myself. She didn’t want to reimburse me the cleaning fee. 
I would not suggest that apartment to anybody.","9"
"Real cool","9"
"The place is close to the main strip of bars and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay and the parking was also great. The place's cleanliness could be better, but for the price and the location and the free parking we thought it was fine.","9"
"Karim is an excellent host and his place is clean, spacious and is in the perfect location of downtown Montreal! 5 stars all the way!","9"
"This apt is located so that you can walk to the old port area or the McGill area. Also very near the metro stop if you want it. Having  indoor parking is a huge plus. Karim is very quick to answer any questions and was very kind to let us check in a little early. If you are looking for a nice space, but no frills and basic this is a great place. ","9"
"Appartement propre, accès simple et sécurisé (parking souterrain) je recommande! ","9"
"The apartment is in the heart of downtown Montreal, so certainly an ideal location. The fact that a parking spot is included is big a bonus. The apartment appeared as advertised. However, it was extremely filthy. I was able to inform the host and show him, so hopefully he will address and rectify this with the cleaning company he has hired. The most problematic issue was arriving in 30+ degree weather with no a/c installed as advertised (which was a main criteria in selecting this place). It was quite unbearable. 
While Karim was very prompt and polite in his exchanges leading to our check-in, once this issue had to be addressed I was very unimpressed with how it was handled. After several exchanges trying to address this legitimate concern, which disrupted most of our evening, arrangements were finally made to come and install the a/c that night. In the end it only made a slight difference, given that its an older window unit. If you plan to use the kitchen, be aware that some essentials are missing; including the proper items to wash and dry dishes. Otherwise, the bed and pull out couches are very comfortable for sleeping, and the highlight for us that mostly compensated for the other disappointments was the amazing rooftop patio and pool on the top floor. If this host is able to rectify the few issues addressed, this place has a lot of potential.","9"
"This place is perfect for a short trip to Montreal! Communication with Karim was great. The apartment is spacious and we had elevator access to and from our parking so easily. Thanks Karim!","9"
"Stayed 1 night for a short trip to Montreal.
Communication with Karim was very prompt. 
Parking inclusion is a great bonus. Check-in instructions were very clear.
Apartment building is on older side but no complaints overall.

Thanks Karim!","9"
"Karim was a super communicative, great host.","9"
"Location was great. Very affordable. A few cleanliness issues.","9"
"Karim’s place is large, clean, with excellent location and good amenities. Although the building is old the apartment is great. The check in and out is convenient and communication with Karim is also very easy.","9"
"Good place for the money","9"
"Karim's place was nice and cozy. A good deal for the price considering it included parking and the location was close to everything. Only thing was that the AC was not very cold, however we bring a portable fan whenever we rent with Airbnb and that certainly helped. Other than that it was good. Thanks Karim!","9"
"We’ve stayed in a number of AirBnB’s. All have exceeded expectations. However this one, not so much. For the most part, it was clean & neat but had dust & grime in places that made you wonder if the rest was clean. There were only 2 pillows on the bed & they had pillow shams to match the bedspread. Normally, I would want to sleep on pretty pillow shams or want my clients to mess them up. I think a pillowcase would be a better choice. The unit is located right in the heart of lots of restaurants & shopping. We had great off street parking. And, the owner was very helpful with getting the TV to work. Turns out the batteries were dead. ","9"

"Great place to stay, stayed here in July 2018 from the USA, right in downtown walkable to restaurants and etc. Pool wasnt working but that wasnt Karims fault. Parking is easy and free in covered garage. Will definitely stay here again when I come back","9"
"Near downtown,can park.","9"
"logement bien placé et facile à trouver, procédure d'arrivée claire et facile. attention à l'hauteur max du parking (1m77). superbe piscine a l'intérieur niveau penthouse. les points négatifs : appartement usé et pas propre, lit très mou, air conditionné insuffisant. ","9"
"Bonne localisation 
Prix correct 
Piscine fermée (travaux) quand nous y étions...
Balcon très sale (mégots de cigarettes partout sur le sol)
Bonne communication avec Karim
Wifi très moyen...","9"
"Had a great stay , the place was everything I  expected","9"
"This has an excellent location - a block from guy Concordia metro and St Catherine’s. Karin sent detailed check in/out instructions so that went smoothly. The parking spot was extremely convenient to have (and rare in downtown). The room itself is nothing fancy, but the price reflects that and the pictures show exactly what to expect. I would stay at Karim’s again.","9"
"Karim's place was very nice, and a great location too. Would definitely recommend!","9"
"In trying to be fair, I’ll break it up into two parts:

PRO’s: Off street parking was wonderful at this location. It’s close to numerou (Website hidden by Airbnb) Restaurants and within walking distance to the Metro subway.

CON’s: The floors, walls, and baseboards were extremely dirty and left us with a (Website hidden by Airbnb) unclean feeling. The furnishing were very minimal and the bed was very (Website hidden by Airbnb) uncomfortable. We could not find washcloths or kitchen towels.

Overall, I cannot reccomend this location and we would not stay again until the owner corrected the noted deficiencies.","9"
"Karim is a great host. We were allowed to check in a little bit early which was a big help. The Netflix was a nice touch. There was no toaster which was a slight let down. The location is prime and the gym is well equipped.","9"
"I would rent this again it was such a smooth experience. The only negative thing was the parking spot in what might be the tightest corners in a parking garage. Managed alright but could not see myself driving a Van down there. You can see scrapes where the cars hit the corners.","9"
"Karim’s place is centrally located. Just a short walk to the Bell Centre with lots a restaurants nearby. Free parking is a plus but it really needs a good cleaning.","9"
"Alles in Allem war die Unterkunft wie beschrieben und erwartet. Die Lage ist prima, gleich ums Eck gibt es eine Metrostation und man kann kostenlos parken. Die Wohnung ist geräumig und der Gastgeber ist sehr hilfsbereit.","9"
"Amazing! Loved the pool and sauna on the roof!","9"
"The price and location of this place is really amazing! We were in Montreal for a wedding and about a 10 minute walk to the venue and 5 minutes to the metro stop. I think the place needs a thorough cleaning, there is lots of dust and the place is missing some essential kitchen appliances and utensils (no toaster, only one decent knife). Overall I was happy with the stay and we used the pool and sauna which was lovely. The free parking was a great bonus but very tight for having a large SUV.","9"
"Spacious apartment!","9"
"The only good thing about the place is the location. It's the filthiest and least well equipped Airbnb unit I've stayed in.","9"
"Pro: great location, easy to find, great price, parking is a plus. Secure!
Con: The bathroom was not cleaned. There were hair and dust over the air vent and the walls. Behind the door was super dirty. The base of the toilet was filthy with urine stains. The bathtub was not cleaned, had soap gum etc.
The kitchen area was not cleaned and the oven was dirty, the refrigerator was not cleaned as well.
The bed was cheap and was horrible, the first night my back hurt so much that I slept on the futon in the living room. 
The floor was dirty and the apartment need to be deep cleaned. To top it off the upstairs neighbors partied none stop the time we were there. I know you’re not responsible for the hallway but the smell of curry in the hallway doesn’t help.
I read the previous reviews and I was skeptical because there’s a lot of people that love to complain so I decided to see for myself. Mistake, Mistake, Mistake","9"
"Great basic place in a great location! Thanks Karim!","9"
"Not clean enough","9"
"Karim made it very easy to check in, super informative + helpful. The apartment is super close to the metro. Lots of great Korean food close by. WiFi had a good signal. Parking space was a great convenience.  Unfortunately, the blue chip provided to enter the building didn't work during our whole stay, the apartment was pretty dirty and super outdated. On our last night the hot water wasn't working. On the day of departure it still wasn't working.","9"
"good location, good price, would recommend for folks coming in for a quick visit and are price conscious","9"
"Très bien situé, on peut marcher jusqu'au centre ville en laissant la voiture à l'abri dans le parking privé et surtout gratuit.","9"
"Very perfect place","9"
"Great location! Place wasn’t fancy but did the job.","9"
"Great location as it’s convenient to downtown and shopping. The parking spot is a plus. Amenities ad expected. The host is quick to respond to any inquiries and provided detailed check-in instructions that made the process very easy.","9"
"great spot to chill and feel at home.","9"
"Perfect","9"
"place was great! very neat and the directions were very clear","9"
"ATTENTION!!!! ATTENTION!!!! Do not live in this place. This is the worst place you can imagine. Everything is old and dirty. Obviously the host doesn’t care about this place any more. I booked for 9 days, and tried to alter down my check out date. The host won’t do it because no one would like to book this place. All the listing is old and dirty. The room is dark. The worst thing is the strong smell in the hallway and the bed. It’s definitely a horrible place to stay. And the host is not reasonable at all. I hope guests can read this and choose wisely. I had to book another place and paying for this one as well. HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE!!!!","9"
"Karim’s place was in a great location and was exactly what we were looking for. The only issue was with the parking on premise. The clearance is 70 inches so if you have a vehicle that is higher than that you will need to find parking elsewhere. Overall, the checkin was easy and the place was very clean!","9"
"Allain is a great host, he was very accessible and helped us with parking. He is very friendly and his place is super cool! I would totally recommend his place! ","10"

"You can stay anywhere in Montreal, maybe near the river, maybe downtown BUT if you want to have the best time of your life stay here. The neighborhood is fantastic (ask Virginie for croissant recommendations, she's a connoisseur). Bixi stations 1 block away fun and fantastic places to enjoy really close.
Virginie is a fantastic host that will make you forget about going back home.
This is my goto place in Montreal from now on.","10"
"I had a great stay at Virginie's spacious flat in the Laurier neighbourhood. She was a friendly, welcoming and helpful host, highly recommended!","10"

Niveau de propreté nickel, c'est un plaisir de séjourner chez Virginie. ","10"
"I stayed to Alain's place only for a night, I arrived late and I left early the next morning. For the night that I stayed the place was very good.","10"
"Belle endroit. Il sera nécessaire de mettre un répétiteur wifi car ça ne passe pas très bien dans la chambre  . Alain est très sympa, dommage , je suis resté que 4 nuits . je n'ai pas eu le temps d'établir un lien avec lui. ","10"
"Check in was easy. Alain greeted me at the door. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The Metro was about a 5-10 minutes walk, but just drove into the city. Please remember, you are not staying at a high end hotel. The accomodations are basic, but he is not charging a lot. For the money, it is a great deal.","10"

"This is the perfect spot in terms of location, amenities and having a great time in Montreal. My family came and loved Montreal in part because this place was a wonderful place to relax between doing all the touristy things. It's right next to the rosemont metro and a walk away from everything. The condo was spacious, clean and Francis even met with me a day before since my family was arriving earlier the next day to handover the keys. I would definitely recommend this place and absolutely have my family stay here if they visit again :)","10"
"Great place. Did I say place, I meant 'palace'! It's a sweet two bedroom condo in a very accessible part of Montreal, very clean and comfortable. Francis really came through for myself and my friends by taking us in last minute when our other AirBNB host fell through. Not only did Francis come through for us, but he was a great host and answered all our questions promptly. Would highly recommend!","10"
"Amazing host, great communication, amazing location and super clean, very modern. 5 stars all the way!","10"

"The apartment is bright, very clean, spacious, fully equipped, and well located.  The hosts were always reachable, friendly, and helpful.  I highly recommend booking this apartment and hope to do so again myself in the future.","10"
"The apartment was fantastic!  Some places (fairmount bagels) were within a short 10 minute walk.  Other places we had to drive around.  But with the free parking on the street during the weekend, getting around was hassle-free.  Close to grocery store and metro stations (5 min walk).","10"
"AJ and his brother Chris were great hosts, easy communication, and the place was just as described, very modern clean and comfortable and with every detail thought of.  Amazing location near the mile end and Plateau. we really enjoyed our stay-  a pleasure all around!","10"

"Great apartment and great hosts!  I booked the place for my parents who thoroughly enjoyed the stay.","10"
"This apartment was perfect for our family of four - two adults and two teenagers. The air conditioning kept us cool on hot summer days, the balcony was lovely for coffee in the mornings, and the space was immaculate. The kitchen is, amazingly well stocked with just the things we needed to make basic meals, good coffee, and possibly a cake or two! The location ended up being perfect for our 25 minute walks to Jean Talon and 15 minute walks to Mont Royal. It is not in the center of activities in the Plateau so it was quiet and the balcony faced tree tops from the second story. The closest bakery or café is a 5 - 10 minute walk.","10"
"The condo is a bright and airy  space in a great location. My family of 4 stayed and had everything we needed. We’ll stay again! Thanks AJ","10"
"The condo exceeded our expectations.  It was well designed, nicely furnished, and fully equipped for our 6-day stay.  We had 2 guests over for dinner to join the 3 of us staying there, and it was well suited to the event.  Lots of utensils and small appliances to meet our every need--toaster, toaster oven, microwave, coffee maker, etc.   Modern appliances and large washer and dryer.  AJ and his brother were very responsive to our questions and needs. We felt right at home.","10"
"AJ apartment is really good. Location is in one of the best spots of Montreal, close to groceries, restaurants and transportation. The apartment was very clean and comfortable exactly how is in the photos. Communication was perfect as well! I'm sure I will come back! 1000% recommended!
Thank you so much AJ.","10"

"Anass was flexible with when we checked in and out. He welcomed us in person and told us a bit about the building. He left us some fruit and tea in the kitchen which was very nice. When we entered the apt the first thing we noticed was the odour. He told us he had a dog which was obvious from the smell. The apt was dusty and the bathtub was really dirty.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Allens place was awesome! We got the whole apartment to ourselves. The view was amazing and the pool was nice after a hot day. Allen was super nice. He gave us suggestions on where to eat and was very understanding when out check in time was delayed by an hour because we got caught at the border. I recommend this place for both a family or a group of friends!","9"
"Allen's place is well located close to all the restaurant and night life in downtown Montreal. I recommend his place and when the carpet will be changed soon with wood floor it will be perfect","9"
"Very friendly and welcoming host. The apartment is cute with a great balcony for beers and/or BBQ. The view is especially nice, and the location practical. There is a dog smell, but we were forewarned about it, and it can easily be masked with some incense.","9"
"Allen is a good host. Buena localizacion. Everything as expected. Quiet place. Pleasant terrace.","9"
"Allen was a great host , he patiently waited for us when arrived very later than expected (after midnight) and he was always quick to respond to any questions we had. His apartment was conveniently located within walking distance to many sites , restaurants and bars and to public transport. Apartment was clean with a comfortable bed and had a balcony with an awesome view of the city. We recommand it and will stay again there if we go back to Montreal","9"
"Great central location. Street parking however there is a parking garage right next which is very convenient","9"
"We stayed in Allen's apartment for two nights and were blown away with how nice the stay was. The view from the large windows and balcony were amazing, a beautiful glimpse of the city from the 19th floor. Everything was clean, with very unique decorations. Although the apartment is a little small, the three of us did not have any space problems. Allen was able to give us some recommendations for places to go in the area, and was very kind each time we interacted with him. Although the apartment smelled a little like dog, it was not overwhelming or off-putting in any way. The location of the apartment itself is great, literally steps away from delicious restaurants. If you are looking for a great place to stay in Montreal, do not look any further!","9"
"Allen provided us with parking information for the weekend; names of places where we could find the type of restaurants we wanted; directions to several grocery stores; provided us with contact information in case we needed his assistance.","9"

"Great location! Communication was easy.","9"
"We had a fantastic stay here. The location is amazing, half a block from a metro station and a street with lots of restaurants, bars, shops. It's a lively area yet nice and quiet in the apartment.

The place itself was spotless when we arrived, and the bed was very comfortable.

Self-check-in was easily done with keys in a lockbox, and the host was easily available by phone/text throughout our stay. We're only sorry we didn't get to meet him.

Highly recommended!","10"
"Abe’s place was perfect for my trip. You couldn’t get more central of a location and check-in/checkout was a breeze.

"Abe's great at communications throughout our trip and always tried to help us. He found us parking around his apartment so that we could leave our car there for an extended period of time.

"Great location. Great restaurants and fun pedestrian street just steps away. Metro station too.  Abe was quick to answer all questions. Friendly and helpful. Apt was very clean.  We had a great stay.","10"
"This apartment is PERFECTLY located in the Village near Metro Beudry, you will be in the middle of everything if you're hanging out in the Village, but if you need to go anywhere else, the Metro is literally a 1-minute walk and taxi's are all over. Check-in/Check-out was a breeze because the keys will be waiting for you in a lock box. There is no TV, so you will need to bring your own entertainment for when you are not out sightseeing, dining or at the clubs.","10"

"Bon séjour à Montréal. Bel appartement quoiqu'un peu bruyant mais bien situé.","10"

Je recommande vivement le choix de cet appartement ","10"
"Abe's place was super clean. The location is great. Literally just steps away from the metro and many restaurants and shops. However, being a ground unit located right near the front door, there is little privacy. The apartment also does not have AC, however there are two large fans which definitely helped. All in all I would recommend and I would also stay here again","10"
"The location is absolutely great if you want to be right in the heart of the gay village, even its proximity to the liveliness doesn’t imply noisy. The queen size bed is comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. But if you like your Airbnb to be something to come home to, keep looking. And though the photos might suggest there’s a patio, there isn’t.","10"
"Perfect location and dazzlingly rapid responses. Abe is amazing.","10"
"Il s’agit d’un appartement merveilleusement situé. Au cœur même du village. Et à la porte du métro Berry. Aucun trajet. Cependant l’appartement reste calme et protégé. Vous y trouverez à proximité très proche, restos, cafés, bar, clubs, magasins etc... tout est à proximité. On peut vivre dans le quartier sans même y bouger. 
La rue est magnifique car les immeubles sont typiques de MTL. 
Abe est un hôte de qualité.

"Great location if you want to be in the heart of The Village. Metro stop right outside the front door. (unfortunately, so we a number of homeless people.) Still felt very safe. Building is OK, a bit older and run down, but you can't beat the location and convenience as well as the cleanliness. Not crazy about being on first floor and there was a young child running around a lot above us that you could hear very clearly.
The apartment was very spacious. And very reasonably priced. Great value. Had an awesome time in a great city.","10"

"endroit parfait pour personne seul ou couple. bien situé.  les lieux sont propre et bien aménagé. un peu bruyant.","10"
"Amazing apartment that is clean, comfortable, well suited, easy check in. The location is perfect you can walk to everywhere. Super great deal especially for the price. I was thrilled with the smart tv and the washer and dryer inside the unit. The host are super responsive and go the extra mile (km) to make sure guest are situated. I can’t wait to stay here again on my next trip.","10"
"Excelente opcion! definitivamente el mejor apartamento para quedarte en Montreal. tiene una excelente ubicacion. el apartamento tiene muy buen tamaño y muy limpio. pero definitivamente lo que tengo que resaltar es la ubicacion!! a solo unos minutos caminando tienes todo y la zona muy muy muy segura. por supuesto que regresando me quedare en el mismo apartamento","10"

"Really enjoyed our stay at Abe’s! The closest metro stop was closed, but it’s in a great location and is a nice cozy space. We really enjoyed our trip to Montreal!","10"
"Vmt Très bien placé, avec une super boulangerie la « mie matinale » à 5 min. Attention station de métro Beaudry fermée pour travaux dommage car elle est à 30metres! 
Abe a été hyper réactif suite à nos demandes. Merci ! 
Légèrement mal insonorisé: on entend les voisins du dessus (enfants) mais pas vmt gênant avec le décalage horaire !","10"
"I had a great stay here. Excellent location and the apartment had everything I needed. Check-in was easy also.","10"
"Abe très disponible en cas de questions. Appartement bien situé dans Montréal & à côté de tout. Nous reviendrons ! Merci encore pour tout.","10"
"Abe and Leslie’s place is very cozy , clean and convenient, location-wise. It is very close to everything you’ll need, be it food, transportation, entertainment or anything else. The location is also safe. They also respond quickly to messages. I would love to stay again at their place in the future.","10"
"Very nice, clean and well located appartment, close to many markets and restaurants. My husband and I really liked the accomodation and hope to come back soon. Great hospitality.","10"
"Je recommande vivement proche de tout","10"
"It was the ideal apartment for my friend and I during spring break. It’s ideally located (although it will be even more ideal when they finish repairing the metro stop that’s right next to it), clean, and plenty spacious for the both of us. We never had problems with things like hot water or the A/C. It’s in a part of town where we felt safe walking home very late at night, and the check-in/check-out system is ideal for a flexible travel schedule.","10"
"Beautiful apartment, location could not be better. Great communication and nice hosts. Recommended!","10"
"Appartement bien situé et au charme fou ! Propreté et confort assuré ! 
Sarah (et Antoine) ont su rester discrets mais toujours  disponibles durant notre séjour ! 
Je recommande vivement ! ","10"
"Top notch location on a quiet, one-way street with available parking (if you are lucky, be careful of reading the signs carefully). Spent a lot of downtime on one of the two balconies. Easy access to bike paths and all the treasures of Mile End. Clean, comfortable, and good hosts. Would definitely stay again!","10"
"Logement très coquet et à environ quinze minutes du métro. Quartier agréable, animé et proche des commerces. Très bon accueil.","10"
"We loved staying here! It was easy to reach and communicate with Sarah/Antoine. We felt at home here and would feel lucky to stay here again.","10"
"The location is FANTASTIC! It is across the street from Kem Coba, Fairmount Bagel, and very close to many other great restaurants and bars. It's also a nice walk to Mont Royal and a few blocks from parks and the subway. I couldn't have asked for a better location. The apartment itself felt very homey! I would stay here again!","10"
"The apartment is really comfortable and cosy and has everything you need. My boyfriend and I felt right at home. There are two little balconies, which is nice. The neighbourhood is cool with a lot of restaurants, shops and cafes but also quite noisy at night. Also the parking situation on the plateau can be a bit frustrating. Apart from that, We would absolutely stay there again!","10"
"Beautiful place in a really accessible area. Communication was quick and straightforward!","10"

"Superbe appartement très bien situé. Le matin, les bagels Fairmont et le café du coin sont à 2 pas. Le quartier offre des restos merveilleux tout près. La rue est une rue cyclable et les bornes Bixi sont vraiment tout proche. Nous avons adoré!","10"
"This apartment is beautiful, large, and in an incredible location. The patio door was new and locked us out on the patio which could have been a disaster but Antoine was amazing and came within 10 minutes to help us out! We were here for a short time but this apartment is definitely suitable for longer stays as well! 

Next time I am in Montreal I will be staying here if it is available!","10"
"This place was great ! I'd recommend it to all my friends!","10"

"Everything about this stay was great.  Most of all was the style and atmosphere of the apartment, it was unique and charming","10"

"Wonderful apartment full of light and style!","10"
"This is a lovely little apartment full of books, plants, and interesting art. It is the perfect location in the Mile End neighborhood. The street has a lot of bike traffic but is otherwise pretty quiet.","10"
"My friend and I had a great time in Montreal at Sarah and Antoine's place! It's well located! We were closed to great coffee shops and bakeries!","10"
"Sarah's place is a great choice for your Montreal stay. It is a quiet, safe and private home, in a great location. The streets around Sarah's house are perfect for wandering, exploring, eating and drinking. We loved the area. The home is green and spacious and has lovely natural light. Antoine managed our reservation and he was very responsive and helpful. He kindly allowed us to check in early as we arrived early from the airport. He went to the effort of having the apartment cleaned earlier than planned and for that we are very grateful. Thank you Sarah and Antoine. I highly recommend this apartment.","10"
"The location is amazing. Perfectly central in Mile End. This literally made our trip. Also conveniently located to many areas in the city— easy to take an Uber from there and explore. Apartment is clean! Communication was seamless and super flexible. Great stay.","10"
"The place is absolutely charming. Middle of mile-end. A lot of books.","10"
"très coquet appartement très bien placé a deux pas des meilleurs bagels de la ville :) merci !!
","10"
"Sarah's place is in a perfect location for enjoying Montreal. It's within walking distance of countless boutiques, across the street from delicious ice cream, and near so many affordable and delicious restaurants. My wife and I particularly enjoyed shopping for records at Phonopolis, then playing them on the turntable at Sarah's apartment while we relaxed on the balcony. ","10"
"Sarah's apartment is charming in the wonderful Mile End close to everything!! The balconies really make the stay","10"
"This place is great! Will definitely stay again.","10"
"Sarah's apartment is beautiful, clean, artistically decorated and well lit. The location is great, too.","10"
"Agréable et bien centré dans le mile end","10"
"Loved our stay in this quirky apartment. Awesome location in Mile. So responsive and helpful with information and details about the stay. Highly recommend!","10"
"Sarah’s apartment is located
in a great area. There are several delicious restaurants located within a 30
second walk (Wilensky’s, Fairmont Bagel, Fabrege, etc.) and several bars.
The street is located a 1 minute walk from St. Laurent and public transit, making it easily accessible.
The apartment is clean, tidy, eclectic.
The apartment is very small. The bedroom is tiny but the terrace is a nice touch,
There is a terrace off the kitchen as well, which offers a private spot to enjoy morning coffee or an evening glass of wine.
The downside is the tiny bathroom, which is functional but very small.
During a heat wave, we recommend that a window a/c unit be available. It was so hot and muggy
in the apartment which made our stay less enjoyable.
Thank you to Sarah and Antoine’s employee/helper for quickly setting up the mattress for the 3rd guest. Thank
you for the bottle of wine as well, that was a very thoughtful gesture.
The location is great, the apartment is clean, tidy and artfully
eclectic, which is something we appreciated.
Thank you:)","10"
"Lovely place in a great location!","10"
"Sarah’s home was a true Montreal treat! Her home was perfect for a quiet getaway while still being in walking distance to outstanding venues and activities.","10"
"Très joli appartement, coquet, lumineux, arty au cœur du Milend, très pratique et parfait pour une découverte de Montréal. ","10"
"This is an amazing place to stay. Host was super helpful and made check-in easy. 10/10 would def come back. I loved the space but this place kinda scary at nighttime. idk maybe its cursed, bring nightlight as hosts do not provide one.","10"
"Sarah’s place was a great location for anyone looking to explore and enjoy the Mile End neighborhood. Antoine was also very responsive and was an ease to communicate with.","10"
"This is a really beautiful little gem with an authentic Montreal feeling located in the heart of the Mile End. The apartment was full of plants which added a charming touch. It was easy to communicate with Sarah and I would definitely stay here again if I needed!","10"

"Je suis resté une nuit et c'était bien. 
Le gros plus est l'emplacement de l'appartement, un superbe quartier avec tout à proximité.","10"
"Amazing little place!","10"
"Wonderful, quirky apartment. This is our favorite kind of Airbnb place, where you feel like you're really living in someone else's place. Cozy and interesting books, music, layout. Wonderful balconies (if only it had been warm enough outside to enjoy them.) Great location, right in the heart of Mile End.","10"
"Nous avons adoré l’appartement de Sarah ! Mon copain l’appelle l’oasis parfait pour des âmes créatives. Merci beaucoup de votre hospitalité, nous avons beaucoup aimé la déco et le quartier !","10"
"Cozy and convenient place in a great neighborhood","10"
"L'appartement d'Ali est très fonctionnel, propre et bien placé dans Montréal. La terrasse rooftop est très appréciable à tout moment de la journée. La communication à été très facile et réactive. Nous recommandons vivement Ali. ","9"
"Our stay at Ali's place was exceptional. It was my first time arranging an Airbnb, but Ali and the check-in host were both very accommodating and great at answering questions. The apartment is within walking distance of nearly everything in Montreal, but there are plenty of things to do near his home as well. We got a parking ticket at 8:30 AM when the street meter said we could park the car between 9PM-9AM, so if you're unsure about parking it might be safest to leave the car in a garage.","9"
"Ali was an excellent host, the apartment was very clean and comfortable. The location was great and we found that most sights were within walking distance. We were able to find paid parking on the street out front with no issues. Definitely recommend!","9"
"Nice place, excellent location close to green line metro station.","9"
"Great location, helpful host","9"
"Very convenient location, just a short walk into downtown. The rooftop was also a nice place to sit and see the view! We were able to find parking in a small lot across the street at the College de Montreal in the L'ermitage building. Great place to stay if visiting Montreal.","9"
"Great location and great apartment. Would stay there again.","9"
"Stay away from this place 
And site offered to reimburse us for town days stay at holiday inn and still has not","9"
"Loved Ali's place! We were greeted at the door, it was very clean, and it's a wonderful location.","9"
"Ali's flat is perfectly located in the heart of Montréal, close to metro station, restaurants, bars...The place was really clean when we arrived and the penthouse offers great view by night. We couldn t have meet Ali but everything was arranged to make our check-in flex and easy ! I really recommand this place. Thanks Ali","9"
"We stayed at Ali's place for two nights to explore the city. The location is great, and communication with the host and the management company was excellent. We arrived later than expected but that was thankfully no problem. The key exchange felt somewhat hasted though, and we never got an answer as to where to best park our car in the neighbourhood during the day. Free parking is available o/n just on the street (9pm-9am). The apartment itself is well equipped and designed, it was clean and had everything we needed. It doesn't feel as much as home as we would have liked it, but the building has a great rooftop with lots of sun. I recommend this place.","9"
"Super rapport qualité prix! 
L'appart est sympa, propre, bien situé ! 
Je le recommande .","9"
"Apartment was in one of the best parts of Montreal. Short walk to the subway station, restaurants, bars and nightlife. 
Only issue was finding parking in the area, but this is for any apartment downtown. I would highly recommend.","9"
"Endroit conforme à la description ! Accueil sympathique, endroit calme. J'ai passé un bon moment !","9"
"Would definitely stay here again","9"
"Great place with an even better rooftop! Would highly recommend and will definitely be back next time I’m in Montreal.","9"
"This appartment is well located, next to a couple of convenience stores and a short walking distance from the shopping area and metro. Nice bonus: roof-top deck with view on the city skyline. Parking on the street, which may or may not be easy to find depending on day and time of day.
Four people can sleep, with one double bed in the bedroom and a very comfortable IKEA sectional that converts into a queen-size bed in the living room.  There was no coffee maker which should be taken into consideration when planning your trip -- We needed to go out to get our coffee in the morning. Communication through Airbnb was very pleasant, and we felt well served as we prepared for our arrival and at check-in.","9"
"Excellent! Everything is very very good!","9"
"Logement bien situé , c'est le seul point positif.
Très mauvaise odeur dans la salle de bain avec une ventilation très bruyante.
Très peu de papier dans les toilettes et équipement global au minimum.
Le pire c'est qu'une fenêtre n'est pas sur la glissière qui la reçoit , elle est posée a coté de son emplacement et de ce fait l'air froid rentre dans la salle qui doit être surchauffée.
Nous avons du boucher le trou avec des serviettes de bain et les coussins du canapé.
Après prise de contact avec l'agence de location et signalé le problème qui nous était presque imputé , j'ai reçu cette réponse mail de mon interlocutrice.

Merci pour cet envoi. 
Après vérification auprès du propriétaire, c'est comme ça depuis toujours... je peux comprendre que cela fasse rentrer le froid mais je n'ai pas de meilleure solution à apporter. 

Je ne peux que vous conseiller d'essayer de bloquer avec des serviettes (il y en a d'autres dans l'armoire), et d'augmenter le chauffage si le froid passe trop.
Je suis désolé de ne pouvoir vous donner que cette ""solution"".

A votre disposition si besoin.
Bonne journée,
Sacha","9"
"This is a great place for a business trip (or any other type or travel)! The apartment is a great alternative to a hotel, super clean and in a great location. The service was great as well, check-in and check-out were extremely easy. Will definitely be back next time I am here :).","9"
"Would definitely recommend staying here! My friend and I spent the weekend and it was a lovely little apartment, very close to downtown. Nice amenities and decor; quick respond times from the host. We had an amazing time, thanks Ali!","9"
"Ali's place was perfect for our family.  Very clean, secure, close to metro and a variety of restaurants and shops.","9"
"We had a lovely stay at Ali's place, parking was a bit of trouble  but we had no other issues.","9"
"Perfect location to access Montreal, the apartment is nice and open space except the bathroom. Reasonably clean, with a nice to have Roku TV.","9"
"No está súper lejos del downtown pero no es lo más cercano que existe","9"
"Super appartement bien situé et avec tout ce qu'il faut! Si je devais retourner à Montréal je retournerais dans cet appartement !","9"
"Ali's place is great for a few of friends looking for somewhere to stay in the heart of Montreal.

The inside was a clean apartment and a homebase with all the essentials.  Make some memories on the patio rooftop, make some plans for the night in the dining room, set off on an adventure, and tag along back to the second floor for a comfy night back.  Lastly, Ali is good about keeping in touch, like when for instance my flight was delayed and we needed to reschedule arrival.  

Thanks again Ali.","9"
"Great place. Prime downtown location. Perfect if you’re doing business at Concordia or the Montréal General Hospital! Place shows it's age a bit, but clean.","9"
"Great apartment!","9"
"Ali’s place was very conveniently located downtown. Just a slight issue with parking nearby, but they were super helpful in trying to help out. The apartment was clean, had bathroom supplies and lives up to the pictures. Would 100% recommend to anyone staying in Montreal who prefers being minutes away from all the local sights!","9"
"Great place, awesome location.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 46 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"It is a terrible place, it was extremely dirty, there was not internet connection, the place was hot and humid and there was not even a fan. The shower spits the water all over and after a shower you get the whole bathroom wet. Location is convenient, however the price-quality is totally not fair.  ","9"
"Ali is an amazing host and very helpful! I had such an amazing stay and the location is PERFECT!!! It’s in the center of it all. Everything is walking distance and the neighborhood is lively. I definitely recommend!","9"
"Ali was a great host and very communicative.  Most importantly, very patient when our estimated time arrival was later than expected (we were driving from NY to Montreal).  The space is accurately described, but during very hot summer days and nights, it gets very little ventilation (windows are small and face a courtyard).  While it says there's no AC, there should be fans provided.  We asked for two fans and were told we could be reimbursed for one fan only. We had two people staying in the back room and one person in the living room - being limited to one fan was not sufficient to provide circulation.  Also, the showerhead was broken and not fixed during our time there.  We did not use the shower the first day or two to avoid spraying the water all over the bathroom (it got the toilet paper wet) - not taking a shower on top of a hot apartment was not ideal.  Finally, the washer had very gross/dirty sheets in there - if we are paying for a cleaning fee, we shouldn't have to see that.","9"
"Très bonne adresse, vraiment bien située. Nous avons passé un très bon séjour et avons profité pleinement du rooftop et de la vue sur Montréal. Très bonne communication avec Ali. Nous recommandons.","9"
"Great location, fair price.","9"
"J'ai séjourné dans l'appartement d'Ali pendant 5 jours. Ali est resté très disponible et à l'écoute. Le check-in et check-out a été simple.

L'appartement correspond aux photos. 

Cependant le matelas du lit n'est pas très confortable (c'est le moins qu'on puisse dire). Il y a aussi un problème avec les lattes de lit qui se deboitent, mais Ali a promis qu'il corrigerai ce point après mon départ.

La chambre à coucher n'est pas séparé du reste de l'appartement par une porte. En conséquence, si vous êtes sensible au bruit, vous entendrez le frigidaire se mettre en marche régulièrement.

En parlant du bruit, la porte d'entrée est très mal isolée; mais tout les appartements de l'immeuble son conçu comme ça...

L'appartement net l'immeuble ne sont pas de première jeunesse, mais un peu comme de partout à Montréal. Lors de mon séjour, les peintres étaient en pleine réflexion des parties communes.

Points forts de l'appartement :

- la localisation (arrêts de bus, station de métro, commerces, parc Mont Royal)
- le roof top avec une très belle vue, surtout en soirée
- la salle de bain propre et fonctionnelle
- lave linge et sèche linge
- la TV avec Netflix

En résumé, j'ai été plutôt satisfait de mon séjour malgré les points mentionnés plus haut.","9"
"Ali was a great host. He communicated very clearly about the check-in process and was very responsive to our needs. His apartment is great value for money. I highly recommend this for anyone on a budget.","9"
"it is a pretty good apartment.","9"
"Thank you Ali for being a great host! This was our first experience using airbnb and everything exceed our expectations.  Ali made us comfortable right form the beginning of our booking and made sure we were happy after check in.  The location of his apartment is perfect, easy to walk around downtown Montreal, and close to everything. Thanks again Ali","9"
"We were very excited for our first time trip to Montreal, but got really disappointed with the apartment. Was not clean, dirt under bed and couches, and in corners. Bed and couch were broken, pillows smelled bad, so we left after the first night. Ali was responsive and answered our messages right away, however the apartment was not in a condition we could stay in. Location is good,  parking is hard.","9"
"Rooftop is spectacular and a real treat. The apartment is in a great location about 5 min walk to Metro down the hill. Well furnished and clean although it lacks natural lighting.","9"
"Très bon accueil, équipe très réactive. Nous avons passons un très bon séjour, le logement est très bien situé et parfaitement propre.","9"
"Appartement bien placé et conforme à l'annonce.","9"
"This place is fine if you’re on a budget and just need a place to sleep. Other than that, the beds are pretty dirty. We felt like we got what we paid for considering how cheap this place was but we wouldn’t stay again. Location was good, short uber rides away from everything. Safe area and building.","9"
"Love the location, the apt is amazingly quiet and the building is as well. Easy check in and large space that was very comfortable! I will return","9"
"Reccomended","9"
"We had a great stay in Ali’s home. The location was perfect","9"
"Ali's place is great! Super close to public transport, shops, etc. Convenience store next door also. Ali was super quick with responses. The apartment was very clean, looked exactly like the photos. The view from the rooftop is amazing. Definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Montreal.","9"
"Great place to stay for 4 or less. A quick walk to downtown. So great location and a cozy place to stay! Worth the book if you're looking to having a roof over your head and a nice place to stay!","9"
"The apartment was clean but little bit smaller then my expectations. Also had some issues with toilet leakage which was fixed later but usually it is not expected during a stay. Other then that the apartment is good.","9"
"Agréable appartement. Cependant, les bottes en Hiver quand il y a de la neige rendent très sale l'entrée.","9"
"Amazing location and super clean! We had minor issues with check-in, but I'm sure this was a one-time issue and did not impact the overall quality of our stay!","9"
"Great location near Guy-Concordia, and definitely worth it if you need a place to sleep at the end of the day. Plus, Luckey Homes has been very responsive, organized, and easy to deal with in terms of logistics such as check-in.","9"
"Great place in a very central location. It made getting around the city very easy.","9"
"We have the next last day and appreciate the understanding when our circumstances changed. Anthony was a great host and the location and apartment was excellent.","9"
"Very clean recently refurbished apartment on the ground floor of a 3 story block. Everything as listed and it was obvious this was a new house as some of the utensils were still in their wrappers. Combination code on the front door for access. 

Location great for little Italy (best bagels and ice cream shops nearby). Parking on street for residents only or at parking meters during the day (9-9) but the street was very quiet with lots of spaces. 

Apt has 3 double beds and a small bathroom with good powerful shower in the bath. Washer and dryer. Anthony also put an inflatable double airmatress that can fit in the livingroom. 

One Aircon unit in the kitchen/living room area. 

Yes it has wifi. We had plenty of room for three teenagers and two parents.   ","9"
"Very beautiful and cozy home. The location is great (close to a lot of restaurants and shops). Overall had an amazing stay","9"
"The perfect place to stay! Very nice and quiet neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and shops nearby. If you're looking to explore the downtown core of Montreal it was only a short (and cheap) car ride away!","9"
"Great location, quiet street and cozy.","9"
"I was travelling with my husband, twins and toddler and we spent 9 nights at Anthony's Mile End apartment. Checkin was very smooth, with the excitement of getting the kids packed and on and off the plane I'd forgotten to contact Anthony about checkin. But, upon landing I saw he'd already messaged me all the information my family would need to get into our rental. The location was easy to get to and we were able to settle right in. At the time we stayed, small touches like dish detergent, hand soap, laundry detergent, paper towels and strong wifi went a long way and were appreciated. There are tons of places to eat in the area and we utilized nearby public transit daily. This place worked well for my family and made our trip possible with lots of happy memories.","9"
"Very clean and comfortable, had everything we needed and the location was great. Would definitely stay here again","9"
"Awesome location near many food options and only a few minutes away by car from all the other areas. Clean and renovated apartment.","9"
"Our stay at Anthony's was great.","9"
"L'appartement est tres propre et spacieux, la literie est très confortable. Situé dans le Mile end a deux pas de toute les commodités. Je recommande!","9"
"This space was just PERFECT for our group. The apartment was on a quiet street with loads of parking spaces (pay). The space was very clean/updated, well furnished, with all of the fittings we needed for our short stay. There is even a washer/dryer, which came in very handy. The neighbourhood was just where we wanted to be. Completely walkable and full of lovely shops and cafes. Beds were comfy and clean with tonnes of pillows :) Check-in and communication with Anthony was easy. I have nothing bad to say here... lovely place. We will be back.","9"
"Everything was exactly as described, and the place is super clean. Street parking is easy to find and the location is fantastic. Highly recommend!","9"
"L’appartement est super bien situé en plein Mile end, très bien équipé et calme. Anthony a été très accommodant !","9"
"We had a really nice stay at this place, the neighborhood is charming and you can walk to the many restaurant, bars, cafés and everything you would possibly need.","9"
"Perfect place to stay","9"
"Great place and great location. Close to shops and great restaurants but not on a main street which allowed for peaceful nights. Anthony was a great host and quickly answered all my questions and provided lots of suggestions for things to do in the area. Definitely worth checking this place out when visiting the area.","9"
"Great spot, as advertised - ground level in the best neighborhood. Ideal for seniors of people with mobility issues.","9"
"When we arrived, we had an issue with some of the radiators not working. As it was the first cold day of the year, the bedrooms were a little chilly. We messaged Anthony and he got back to us right away. He brought over some space heaters for the rooms and had an electrician come and fix the issue first thing in the morning! Anthony is a very responsive host and will go the extra mile to make sure your stay is as pleasant as possible. He even brought us some fresh Montreal bagels to apologize for the inconvenience!","9"
"Staying at Anthony's apartment in Montreal was a pleasure. It was spacious, had ample parking, and felt very safe. As a host Anthony was perfect, with nearly immediate responses to questions and concerns. The accommodations were exactly as described in his post, and all 7 of us were comfortable with the arrangements. It was also an incredibly convenient location, with easy access to a variety of different things to do (restaurants, museums, old Montreal, bars, and nightclubs). I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone who asked, and would gladly stay again myself. 5 stars!","9"
"Glad to say that my first airbnb experience was a great one.  Will do it again another time.  Anthony was a great host who replies very quicklu and well.
We recommend this apartment to all interested.  You will not be disappointed.","9"
"Anthony was a helpful host who always responded quickly to questions we had.","9"
"Très belle endroit dans un cartier tranquille","9"
"Tout était parfait! Emplacement, propreté, surtout le calme, on entendait rien!","9"
"Had a great time! Very convenient location, and nice home.","9"
"Anthony was a great host! He allowed us to check in a couple hours earlier and walked us through the parking situation. He was very pleasant and responsive. The place itself was very cool and well kept. We did have some hot water issues, but since we only stayed for one night, Anthony didn't have the chance to fix them in the time we were there, and he did assure us he would do so before his next guest arrived. Overall, fantastic place to stay!","9"
"Nous n'avons pas eu de chance, pas d'eau chaude, pas de lave vaisselle et draps pas propres","9"
"Anthony is a great communicator and we were able to check in easily and get anything addressed quickly. The house is in a great location, an older house but remodeled retaining elements of both. Was clean for the most part. We were a group of 7 and fit comfortably but keep in mind one of the walls between two bedrooms are French doors so there is a bit less privacy due to that, so you’ll have to be comfortable with that. Very convenient to St. Viateur bagels :) so a great place to see Montreal and really convenient place to park a car if you bring one.","9"

Logement très agréable avec 3 grandes chambres confortables à deux pas du boulevard saint Laurent. Le propriétaire est très réactif à vos demandes, n’hesitez pas ;) tout le confort sur place, un séjour parfait pour nous !","9"
"Anthony was so responsive and helpful and nice! Place was as described and in a great location!","9"
"Great little
Place in Montreal:) so cute and stylish my friends and I loved staying here for spring break","9"
"Mile End a phenomenal neighbourhood. Jeans Jeans Jeans is 1 block away and what a great experience of buying jeans. Overall vibe of Mile End is great and accommodations fit perfect for our trip and our family (including picky/cool teens).","9"
"The place was in the most conveienent spot I've stayed in Montreal. The unit was huge! Great space for the 6 of us who stayed over!","9"
"The place has some potential.","9"
"The space was a little smaller than expected epically a space that advertises it can accommodate eight. 
.
 Since the bedrooms were so close to the common area / kitchen and or bathroom we all had to agree upon a time to sleep and wake so as not to disturb one another.  If eight guests sleep here they would probably be sleeping in the living room which is very close to the kitchen and bathroom and will surly wake anyone sleeping in it.
.
 There was a T.V. but it didn’t have any channels so it seemed a little redundant to have. 
.
All in all the space accommodated our needs that being to sleep, shower and eat but had we wanted to spend any time in the space, much more than we did we I would be on top of one another.  
.
 On a positive not the bed I slept in was VERY comfortable and did not move when shifted in my sleep so my partner was not disturbed. 
.
 Cafe's were very close by with great coffee.
.
Parking over the weekend was not a issue. Review parking for weekday stays.
. 
Check in was seamless.","9"
"Merci beaucoup ! Très beau logement, bien situé.","9"
"Great location. Not my favorite airbnb but it was fine, and check in/check out was very easy.","9"
"Great location, very clean and had all the amenities that our family needed. Anthony was very responsive to messages. Highly recommend this place.","9"
"Great location but a bit run down.","9"
"Wow! What a great stay... first of all this rental is in a perfect neighborhood- you have Mile End at your fingertips and the rest of the Plateau is not far. I loved just exploring the side streets. This place was a great value and definitely worth staying a bit farther from downtown. I would stay here again.","9"
"Our stay at Anthony’s place was comfortable and convenient for our family vacation (4 adults, 1 teen).  Beds were clean and comfortable.  The walls are a bit thin.  

We ate breakfast in the unit quite a bit and found that all the necessary supplies were present for cooking. The dishwasher was not in service.

The unit is a good value and has all necessary items for a nice stay.  Anthony was good about getting back to us. Recommend overall.","9"
"Exactly as listed. Beautiful space in a great neighbourhood, one block away from St Laurent’s amazing bars and restaurants. We slept 5 adults and two kids comfortably and really enjoyed the space. Anthony was a great host, the place was clean and his communication was fantastic. Highly recommend.","9"
"Anthony's apartment was very clean.  The location is perfect, close to shops, restaurants, bars, and a short drive into Old Montreal. ","9"
"Easily the best host I've had. Responses were immediate, and Anthony was kind and accommodating. Loved the apartment -- exactly what we were looking for. 100% would recommend","9"
"Fantastic place in an amazing location. I would absolutely stay there again.","9"
"Staying at Anthony’s place was absolutely perfect-clean, cozy and had everything you need. The location is ideal if you don’t desire to be in the center of everything, but still close enough (walking distance to tons of amazing restaurants and shops). Additionally, Anthony was very accommodating to allow me to check in a little earlier. When I return to Montreal, I know where I am staying and where I would recommend others to stay!  ","9"
"Bonjour nous avons séjourner trois nuits nous étions 4 adultes avec trois enfants. le logement étaient trop petit. beaucoup d'électroménager ne fonctionnaient pas lave vaisselle, hôte et sèche linge. peu de vaisselle pour faire à manger. je ne le recommande pas pour les familles. l'hôte nous n'a pas accueillie et a laissé aucune information sur Montréal ou le logement

"Really nice apartment, perfect location, and perfect to rent for a friends trip ! 
We did not met but Anthony was easily reachable and the instructions were clear to find and enter the apartment ! 
Very nice stay in Montréal ! ","9"
"Close to St. Laurent, a boulevard with numerous bars and restaurants. The Mile End section of the city was great, and only a 7 minute drive into Old Town Montreal.","9"
"Anthonys apartment is a great place to stay during your visit to Montreal. There are many places to eat nearby. The neighborhood felt safe and looked clean. Check in was very easy. Anthony was also very helpful with finding good places to eat, and he responded to our messages very quickly. We loved that the house was stocked with coffee for us to make every morning! We would definitely recommend this place!","9"
"Antony was very attentive to any issues we had and tried to remedy them as best he could.  He was very prompt in answering our messages and queries,  The living areas and kitchen were very clean and spacious, we liked the large table and the sofa was very comfortable.  The beds are comfortable and the sheets were clean.  We were disappointed by the condition of the outdoor terrace and the bathroom.  The apartment, being on the ground floor, was quite dark and the window looks out on a blank wall.  There is no terrestrial (Canadian) tv.","9"
"Great location, clean place. Would go back. Host was very helpful.","9"
"A beautiful place, close to everything, on weekends there is free parking which helps a lot and host was very nice and was always there when i needed anything during my stay!","9"

"We had a great night's stay at this location! Check in was super easy and the beds were nice and comfortable. As another reviewer may have noted, parking is right across the street and free on weekends however I'm guessing paid on weekdays. Would definitely book again!","9"
"Great place, excellent location, easy check-in and out, Anthony is very communicative and obliging.","9"
"Our stay was amazing and that was because we had such beautiful accommodations as our home base. The place was charming, clean, the beds so comfortable, and close to all the amenities. For those with vehicles, parking was easy and free on the weekends. Anthony was quick to answer any questions, and provide tips to make our stay more hospitable. I would love to stay at this location again.","9"
"Anthony was a great host, but the pictures don’t give an honest idea of the condo. It is pretty small and a litter older than we anticipated. But all in all a fun experience.","9"

"Très bel appartement conforme à la description et très bien situé en centre ville MAIS dans une rue où il n'y a que des bars et restaurants, donc .. 
Nous avons été très déçus par l'état de l'appartement, propreté vraiment très très relative. Les choses s'arrangeront certainement et là ce sera un très bel endroit","10"

"Fernando and Sarah firstly answered my questions within minutes. She met me for my checkin and showed me around. the pictures dont give the airbnb justice its much bigger and nicer in person! i was very impressive with the cleanliness, spaace.
there were two balconies, two bathrooms, big comfortable beds and extra linens if needed. they were very accommodating with everything including checkin-checkout which made everything so much easier!

"We had a spectacular time. The location was perfect. We walked everywhere and were always in the midst of the action and pulse of the downtown area. It was clean and quiet. It had everything we needed. The accommodations made a special siblings reunion,  even more special. I found the hosts Fernando and Sarah to be very warm people who were readily available to answer questions or help in any way.","10"

"Wonderful home and great location. Spacious and private for 10! The hosts are respectful and were always available. It was a very relaxed stay. Highly recommended if you want to be in the city center :) Parking was easy to find. We parked and bargained for the weekend at a lot by the end of crescent to the left for 35/night with ins and outs for an extended full size SUV.","10"
"This place is amazing, would absolutely recommend! First, the apartment is beautiful and spacious. It has everything you could need and more. It is much larger than the pictures show. Had 7 people sleep comfortably here for a weekend. Also, location is amazing!!!! You cannot find a better location than this apartment, right nears shops, bars, restaurants, and more. We walked everywhere and rarely took a cab since everything was so close! Will absolutely be coming back to stay here.","10"
"Great place. Great location. Would book again if I️ come back to Canada.","10"

"This apartment is everything you could want in Montreal. The location is perfect, it can fit a larger group, and Fernando and Sarah are excellent hosts.

"Incredible space in a great location. Super clean and great Host.","10"
"Such a great location. We were very welcomed and our host was great at responding to our questions right away. The apartment provided ample space for the 8 of us and was steps away from great restaurants and nightlife. We will come back for sure and have already recommended this spot to other friends as well. You will not regret staying here!","10"
"Very spacious apartment, exactly as described. Great location, I would not want to stay somewhere else in Montreal. At night, you may hear some noise from the Karaoke club from below and from the people on the street outside. Nevertheless, a great place and Fernando was very helpful!","10"
"Such fantastic hosts :) we had a lovely time for a bachelorette party and absolutely loved the space- would definitely stay here again!","10"
"This apartment is absolutely beautiful and at a great location if you want to experience some nightlife. There are a good number of restaurants, bars, and shopping stores around this area and many are open late. Fernando was very kind and my friends and I really enjoyed our stay. We had all the amenities one would want if they were at home. Totally recommend and will definitely love to stay again!","10"
"This is the coolest apartment. The two balconies made it unique and the location is walking distance to so many great spots - especially the Mexican restaurant downstairs!
Fernando and Sarah are the sweetest hosts.","10"
"Fernando's place is great!  The location is right in the heart of Montreal and everything is very easy to walk to.  The apartment is clean and comfortably fits many people - the outdoor space is a great added perk.  If you go, try the restaurant Fernando runs below the apartment - the food and drinks are great!","10"
"Everything about the apartment was great! Perfect location, nice kitchen, loved the outdoor patios, and very clean.","10"
"Such a great place! Amazing location and the place was super clean and spacious. The host was great and responded very quickly to all our messages. Would highly recommend this place!","10"

"Fernando’s apt was a great spot! Perfect location and very comfortable. We enjoyed the great restaurants and bars in close proximity.","10"
"Fernando and Sarah were great hosts! They were very accommodating and quick to respond to questions. The property was also very spacious and in the heart of Montreal. I can't wait to go back!","10"
"Quite literally the perfect location.  The center of all the fun the Montreal has to offer.  You can walk to amazing restaurants, pubs, clubs, shopping.  It has it all. The balcony overlooking Crescent is awesome for late night parties.  Amazingly clean and spacious place.  ","10"
"This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a central location, a sweet view, and a stylishly decorated place. It had everything we could of thought of and beyond. I highly recommend Hernan's space. ","10"
"Hernan and Sarah have a cute spacious apartment in a really fun, walkable area. I’d highly recommend this place for three or four couples due to the current sleeping arrangements. They have great outdoor spaces and super easy check in and out processes. We loved our time here!","10"
"Amazing place, great location and awesome hospitality","10"
"The location was unbelievable. Easy parking right down the street for the weekend ($16/day for 3 full days). Size of the place was accurate to the listing: 3 separate bedrooms, 2 baths/showers. We had 9 and fit comfortably between the 3 queens, pull out queen, and futon. Most of all Hernan and Sarah were amazing - very quick to respond when we had questions or needed local advice. We really appreciated their quick communication and hospitality!","10"
"We stayed here for a bachelor party weekend, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.","10"
"The layout of the airbnb was very nice.  Great location close to good restaurants along with just blocks from st catherine street which has tons of places to go shopping.  Host was quick to give us great recommendations and was very helpful.  Check in was very easy also.  Highly recommend this airbnb!!","10"
"Amazing location and awesome space for a large group of people!","10"
"A spacious apartment in a great central location!","10"
"In town with a big group. Great location easy to everything. Plenty of amenities. Beautiful home. Would definitely stay again if I had the chance.","10"
"The apartment was much bigger than expected, very stylish and great for a group of 11 girls doing a bachelorette. Location is fantastic as well, lots of restaurants and bars around. Unit was also well equipped with all the basic needs. The only thing that could use some improvement was host communication. Other than that, definitely recommend. ","10"
"The place was absolutely amazing. A large space, we had 10 ladies and there were no issues with the common area and we had lots of space to get ready. The apartment is right in the midst of crescent street and the terrace had amazing views. We ordered catering from the burrito place the hosts own which were absolutely beyond expectations. We would not hesitate to come back!","10"
"Great location","10"
"Great views from the front balcony. Right in the heart of the city. The apartment had everything we needed and more. Fantastic stay","10"
"Hernan will greet you and is very responsive, and the restaurant below is very accommodating.","10"
"Hernan’s place was very comfortable for our group of 7 friends to spend a weekend in Montreal. It’s well decorated and centrally located right next to the art museum and many bars and restaurants. Just be aware that the apartment is right above a karaoke bar and on a street with a lot of nightlife, so it’s pretty loud on weekend evenings. You also need to bring luggage up and down a few flights of fire escape stairs. If you don’t mind that, it’s a great place to stay and good value in the area!","10"
"Great house and even better location!","10"
"Great location!!!!","10"
"Simply the best location you could ask for! Would go there again for sure.","10"
"Our group had a great weekend, thank you for your hospitality.","10"
"Great location, and beautiful apartment. Lots of space even for large groups. Lots of stores, restaurant, and bars near by. Cool view from balcony into the picturesque street below. Herman was very informative and responsive. Would stay again in the future. Thank you!","10"
"This place has an unbeatable location.  Six of us went up for a night to go to the Canadiens/Bruins game, and everything was in walking distance from the rink to the bars to the entertainment.  Communication was great and check in/check out was very easy.  There is not parking on site, but their is a parking garage about 1 block down the street for around $30 Canadian per day.  My only problem  with the place is that the 13 guest claim is a stretch.  This wasn't a problem for us as we only had 6, but future travelers should be aware of this.  There are 3 bedrooms, each with a queen bed, a futon, and a couch.  By my count (if you put 2 in each bed and the futon and 1 on the couch) that is enough room for 9.  There were some floor mattresses stuffed into the closets, so I guess you could find a spot on the floor for those to get to 13 but that wouldn't be very comfortable.  Also, there were only lines/pillows provided for the 3 bedrooms so make sure to bring your own sleeping bags/pillows.  Two of my friends had to use their luggage as pillows and their coats as blankets.  This being said, I would definitely rent here again.  Location, location, location.","10"
"Ha an amazing get together. Strongly recommend this huge Airbnb!","10"
"Awesome location.","10"
"We love Montreal and this was such an amazing location.  We visited on an incredibly cold weekend and were able to find great places to eat and amazing coffee on the same block. The Montreal Museum of Fine  Arts is literally next door.  The apartment was comfortable and spacious.  We were 2 families and had lots of space.  Our host was lovely and helpful. Thanks!
I would recommend this beautiful apartment to anyone who is easy-going and looking to be in the heart of the city!

"This place exceeded all my expectations in every possible way. It was by far the most attractive  place available when we were looking, and the location was so perfect. Everything we wanted to do or needed to go was right at our doorstep. 

We stayed here for my 30th birthday, and it was an absolute blast. There was more than enough of space for everyone in our group of six. All the beds were comfortable, and there was lots of space to hangout in the home, too. 

Hernan was very welcoming and made us feel at home right away. He was very responsive to every request and question we had, and  so accommodating. We were able to have early check-in and check out which made our whole trip more enjoyable. 

We fell in love with Montreal on this trip. If we come back with a large group, I would definitely check to see if this place would be available to us again.  I would strongly recommenced this place!!","10"
"Amazing place in the heart of Montreal!","10"

"Great place as usual Pablo!","10"

"We had 2 months in Montreal while visiting McGill and this location was perfect.  A short walk to McGill but also to the Plateau and even downtown. The apartment was very comfortable and well provided for and was pleasantly quiet. The access to shopping, cafes and restaurants in the building was fabulous - particularly in the snow! - and the gym membership was the icing on the cake: pool, sauna, spas, weights etc etc. Just an elevator trip away.  Finally, Vanessa was immediately responsive to questions and queries.  All up, I would recommend this wholeheartedly!  Thanks, Vanessa, for a very memorable stay.","9"
"Appartement propre, exactement comme sur les photos et même mieux, très propre et bien équipé, le logement de Sandrine et très bien entretenu, à proximité d'une rue animée de restaurants et d'épiceries, mais aussi d'une station de métro facile d'accès ou d'arrêts de bus. 
Notre séjour a été super, merci à Sandrine même si nous n'avons pas pu la rencontrer en personne, ses amis ont été super !","10"
"Wonderful apartment- clean, spacious, cozy, and amazing value. Great price for the place! The 2 patios were beautiful and the shower was 10/10. We were greeted in a friendly and welcoming manner which kicked off an amazing stay in Montreal. Would definitely recommend!","10"
"Superbe séjour chez Sandrine, l'appartement est superbe et d'une propreté (Website hidden by Airbnb) plus le quartier est calme et beaucoup de bon petits (Website hidden by Airbnb) recommande vivement !","10"
"Perfect little apartment to come home to after a day of sightseeing and activities. The balcony was absolutely great. A very cute “up and coming” neighborhood. Sandrine was very helpful with suggestions of local things to do and see.","10"

"Amel and Jhonny were so nice with us. They were so patience while we got lost before get into his place.

"This place was great for my big Group , lots of free parking outside  was very helpful and is not easy to find in Montreal , Stewie was a great host very easy to communicate with , check-in checkout was a breeze , and very fast to answer to any ? We had ,  I would highly recommend it to anyone else coming to montreal with a big Group , he was generous enough to give us a late checkout , and it was a short drive to downtown , all in all exactly like advertised","9"
"What a great stay! 
We were amazingly accommodated!
Simon was fast at answering any questions we had. Very helpful. Check in and check out was easy due to the convenience of the lock box. Centrally located & highly recommended. Thanks! ","9"
"What a great host and the place was great for our big  group it had a full kitchen which is good so we were able to cook and eat in , the proximity to downtown was great I would highly recommended to anyone coming to visit montreal one of my best experiences in a Airbnb","9"
"Simon was great to accomodate such a large group of us so last minute after our original accommodation plans fell through. He was very understanding and thorough with details and ensured a smooth check-in and check-out process. The apartment was awesome and very clean, it had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Montreal!","9"
"Great place to stay! Check in and out was quick and easy. We had some issues with the place, but the host was quick to fix any issue we had! Would definitely stay here again. Great experience!","9"
"The house was extremely clean when we got there and Simon is very quick with his responses. He made check-in quite easy and the space was just what we needed. The location of the house is perfect. It is outside of downtown Montreal so it is nice and quiet when you want to relax, but only a short drive to go sight seeing. I would absolutely stay at this place again.","9"
"To be honest I wasn't really happy about this stay at all. We were jerked around from the start about properties that were available and then told we weren't allowed to stay there, told we had to move properties three weeks before our stay, and were told that the second location was downtown when it very, very clearly was not. We were charged for part of a second day stay despite no information on the listing about a minimum stay and also charged extra because of the 'holiday weekend' when Memorial Day is not celebrated in Canada. I would not recommend the property I stayed in or liaising with Stewie to anyone I know. Perhaps if we had been able to stay in our initial, actually downtown property we would have had a better experience, but frankly I wish we had stayed in a downtown hotel instead. ","9"
"Thanks for being so attentive to me and my family! The 2 apartments were very stylish, clean and comfortable. Our family (with a big age range) really enjoyed our weekend stay here. ","9"
"Simon was a super host! Attentive, responded quickly, and checked in with us when we arrived to make sure we were comfortable. We enjoyed our stay in Montreal. Thank you Simon!!","9"
"Couldn't have asked for more. The place was great, the hosts were accommodating, everything was in order. They even came to check on us and gave us places to check out. Great hosts. We had an amazing time would 100,000% rent again!","9"
"Endroit bien pour un grand groupe. Il manquait des draps mais nous nous sommes arrangés. Recommandé pour un court séjour.","9"
"Simon was an outstanding host in every way.  The living space was clean, organized, and it was very easy to check in.  Additionally, whenever there were any questions, Simon responded immediately.  I would recommend Simon's place to anyone looking to stay in a great place while visiting Montreal.","9"
"Place was good, just little smaller as we though but we enjoyed at stay there. Very clean and nice decorated 
Just the parking on the street was very hard to find. Communication was little mix up... sometimes is Simon sometimes is Stewie. So was little confused","9"
"Muy buena opción para hospedaje en Montreal. El espacio es sumamente amplio, fácilmente caben de 10 a 12 personas. Estuvieron muy atentos a todo. Sin duda podría volver a considerarlo.","9"
"I would 10/10 recommend Simon as an air bnb host! He replied in a timely manner and was also available for any help we needed. His location is right outside of downtown Montreal, maybe a 15 minute uber ride to where most of the restaurants and bars are. The interior of the apartment was decorated very nicely and fit our group comfortably. We had a great New Years trip all thanks to Stewie.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"L'appartement de Sarah est particulierement agréable. Chaque objet a été choisi avec attention et clairement avec un oeil design avisé. Nous y avons sejourné en famille et nous y sommes tous tres vite senti tres a l'aise. apres une journee explo de montreal, s'y poser le soir etait un vrai plaisir. et sarah et sa belle mere, ont été tres aidantes et acueillantes.","10"
"Beautifully designed apartment!  Sarah was very easy to communicate with and it was easy to make arrangements for arrival and departure.  I would definitely recommend this place.","10"
"We were surprised that this listing is really a two bedroom! The bed in the second bedroom is a little shorter than normal, but an average height woman fits comfortably. This apartment was super upscale and beautifully decorated, very spacious. I thought it was really incredible value for the cost, and completely exceeded my expectations. Only downside was that it was hot in summer, but the airflow was good and fans were provided so we were comfortable. Came for a family wedding and saw other people's AirBnBs - this one was the best and we paid less than others. ","10"
"This apartment is so lovely — well designed and decorated. You can tell the hosts put a lot of care into making it sophisticated and cozy. I love the natural light. The open and well-equipped kitchen is perfect for making a meal. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet and there’s a great yoga studio around the corner. A little hot without an AC unite, but the fans are fine. I’d stay here again. It’s a great place.
","10"
"Sarah’s place was great for me, my sister and my niece to stay at.  Lots of toys and amenities for a toddler were available. The neighborhood was wonderful for kids, quiet with lots of restaurants available. Overall, great experience!","10"
"L'appartement est confortable, très agréable et beau. Un grand merci à Laurence pour sa gentillesse.","10"
"Laurence's place is super cute in photos, but even better in person! It's super spacious, with two porches, a *huge* bedroom, tons of natural light, Netflix (!),  and total private access. The washer/dryer in unit came in handy too when I needed to clean up a shirt for a night out. My boyfriend and I completely fell in love with the apartment, and because its a bit out of the downtown area, gave us a chance to see another part of Montreal -- a city we've come to love together as New Yorkers. It really only took about 10 minutes via uber to get anywhere we needed or wanted to go, so don't let the location deter you!","10"

Loved the whimsical decor. Check-in was super easy and Martin and Eric are communicative but totally unobtrusive. We got lucky and found parking right on the street. Loved it!","10"
"My daughter and I had just 36 hours in Montreal and were very pleased to be so centrally located in this fun, well decorated apartment. 
We loved the proximity to so many great nearby restaurants.  Also we were very close to Fitz and Follwell, the bike shop where we took a fantastic bike tour of several nearby parks and neighborhoods. 
We also utilized the subway system to go downtown. The metro station is just a few blocks away and very easy, affordable and efficient to use.  
We loved eating the delish (St Viateur) famous bagels, the (Romados)Portuguese chicken, the (Swartz's) smoked meats, the (Pizzadelic) pizza and crepes. All within walking distance. 
I highly recommend this as a great way to experience Montreal.","10"
"Très bonne 1ère expérience rbnb! J'ai énormément apprécié d'arriver dans l'appartement avec une petite lumière allumée. Cela m'a donné une impression de bien être, de cocooning et je me suis sentie comme chez moi... nous avons merveilleuse bien dormi. La localisation est idéale : calme et pourtant proche de tout. Merci beaucoup","10"
"We have had a nice stay in the Numbers. The location was super. The communication was fine and the appartement was nice and clean. I can recommend this place.","10"
"Pleasant and convenient apartment. The two bedrooms are actually adjoining with a French door/slider so it's not ideal for those wanting two totally private bedrooms. Well equipped and comfortable apartment. Close to Metro, shopping and restaurants. Host was accommodating and helpful.","10"

"Great location, walkable to lots of bars and restaurants. We loved Colonel Moutarde and Le Quartier General (BYO). Also an easy walk to Mont Royal. We didn't use public transit because it was so cold, but could easily walk to a stop. Felt very safe at all hours, and enjoyed hanging out in the cozy living room - should have played some board games!","10"
"Great spot to stay in the plateau. Short walk to metro Mont Royal, few minutes to get to Schwartz's, Moishes, Bagel Etc., La Banquis, and Parc Mont Royal. Love home, super cozy and well equipped. Can't wait to stay there again.","10"

"Martin and Eric were great hosts and their apartment was in a great location, close to metro and countless bars and restaurants. It had everything we needed for our week stay and Eric and Martin were very quick to attend to a small problem with the heating( a faulty heating control). We would love to stay again.","10"
"l'appartement de Martin est exceptionnel, la décoration est soignée et de bon goût. Absolument charmant.
bien placé.
Martin nous a gentiment permis de laisser nos bagages au delà de l'heure de checking out, notre avion étant tard le soir.
je recommande vivement cette adresse","10"
"Our family of 4 really enjoyed our stay. It is a great location and a very comfortable space with nice touches. It would be better if the shower could be updated since it is basically a bathtub surrounded by a shower curtain. I really appreciated the few beers in the fridge!","10"
"Lovely place, and great location! Would recommend it. Such a neat neighbourhood to stay in. Thanks again!","10"
"Martin's apartment was great! Amazing location in the heart of Le Plateau, walking distance from trendy bars, restaurants, shops, cafés, and super market. We even walked to Old Montreal which took us about 35 minutes. The apartment itself was bigger than it looks in the pictures, very well decorated and clean. We got lucky and were able to snag one of the free parking spaces on the street, which was a bonus. Overall, one of my favourite Airbnb experiences in Montreal. Highly recommend!","10"
"This place was awesome! Right next to Avenue du Mont-Royal which has a bunch of places to eat, buses, train to get just about anywhere. Bicycle shop is two blocks away and we biked to Vieux Montréal. Apartment was clean, looks just as depicted, definitely a cool, hip space. Great location as well to get to everythinggg you need. Thank you both!! À la prochaine!","10"

"Martin's place was an awesome place to stay while visiting Montreal! The plateau is a beautiful area. There are an abundance of restaurants, bars, and cafes within a ten minute walk. Getting to the mountain is only 10-15 minutes as well. The bike share system in Montreal worked great to head down to the river. The apartment itself is spacious and worked wonderfully. The bed was ridiculously comfy. There is a full kitchen and a nice living room area to hang out. Martin was quick to respond to our messages as well. Overall it was a great experience.","10"

"This is a cute, clean, quirkily appointed apartment on the first floor in a GREAT neighborhood.  Lots of ceiling fans keep the heat down and nights comfortable for sleeping.  Shared courtyard with very friendly neighbors.  Fabulous having a washer and dryer right in the unit.  Walk to everything.","10"
"We like this nice apartment, it is stylish and well equiped with daily needs. Location is wonderful,  there are many restaurants/coffee/bar  and small shops around, and it is close to the subway. We enjoyed very much the staying. Definately we'll recommend it.","10"
"The apartment is in a great location, a quiet neighborhood, and within walking distance of lots of stores and the metro.  The main bedroom is very comfortable. The second has a single bed with a trundle bed underneath which is best suited for the kids. The keyless entry is a nice touch. No losing a key!There is no parking on sight (you definitely can drop your stuff off without a problem) and guests may want to take advantage of the permitted spaces Martin has available. We parked in a parking garage and paid twice as much, but it was very convenient.  All in all, a great place to stay in Montreal!","10"
"Martin's place was perfect for our family of four. The space was clean, comfortable, and just as pictured!  The proximity to Mount Royal was incredible!  We were able to walk from Martin's place to the mountain. The location is perfect!  There are several shops and restaurants less than a block from the apartment. We would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Great place; stylish and clean and in a great neighbourhood.","10"
"My family and I loved staying at this flat in the heart of a thriving neighborhood. There was so many things to do we wished we had stayed longer. We ended up booking two stacked units from Martin which was perfect for our situation. The decor was fun and inviting and felt like home to us. We loved the antique touches and plants scattered throughout.  Checking in and communication was super fast and the apartment had all the necessities for a cozy stay.  Thanks!","10"
"The neighborhood where the house is located is really great and accessible to great coffeeshop, restaurants, and parks.  The host is really caring. Highly recommended! ","10"

The place is also in a great location, 5 minute walk away from lots of restaurants and nice stores. The check in was also super easy. And if we had any questions, our hosts were super quick to reply. 
Definitely would recommend staying here! ","10"
"Nous avions choisi le Quartier du Mont Royal pour sa proximité avec le parc et l'appartement d'un de nos amis. Nous savions donc à quoi nous attendre. Climatisation très appréciée car il a fait très chaud les 2 jours ou nous y étions. Parking à 12$ la journée vraiment pas très loin (car impossible de stationner dans les rues)","10"
"Vous pouvez louer sans hésiter ce bel appartement, très bien aménagé et situé ","10"
"A great comfortable place in an amazing central location in the plateu - would stay again!","10"

"Séjour agréable chez Martin. Appartement très bien placé","10"
"This was a great apartment for our long weekend in Montreal. The hosts were very communicative and answered all of our questions. They were also very kind in letting us arrange to store our bags before and after check-in and check-out. 

The apartment is as stylish as it appears, and very convenient to the Plateau neighborhood. We walked all around the neighborhoods from Old Montreal to Little Italy, and when it was too far to walk, subways and buses were right there. 

The only slight negative would be that, since it is a street-level apartment with the bedrooms facing the street, the noise at night may get a little loud if people are hanging out on the street.","10"
"Enjoyed my stay very much, super stylish and comfortable space. Loved the neighbourhood. Would recommend!","10"
"Super séjour dans un appartement très confortable, Merci.","10"
"Absolutely amazing place-- super close to restaurants, shopping, food markets, etc (I walked everywhere, never got an uber.) The place is really well kept, very tidy and great interior design. I would 5/5 recommend!","10"
"Super Lage, sehr schöne Unterkunft","10"
"Martin's place is very comfortable and well furnished. It's in a great area of Montreal, close to a lot of restaurants, cafes and the like. It's also within walking distance to the Metro station as well, so getting to other areas of the city are quick. The only down side to the apartment is that it can be noisy at times .  
The building is old and has wooden floors, and the apartment directly above seems to be another rental. We were woken up the first morning by a group of people stomping around at 6AM and then dragging their bags down the iron staircase directly outside the bedroom window, then last night woken up well after midnight by another group arriving.
Overall, the apartment was great, but could be annoying depending on the other tenants.","10"
"we enjoyed the location and clean apartment. perfect for a young family.","10"
"Appartement très bien placé dans un quartier calme et agréable. Commerces et transports à proximité.
Seule critique : la douche un peu vétuste..

"Appartement très bien situé, extrêmement propre, bon goût, mais salle de bain au confort limité (douche sans baignoire pas très aisée), porte communicante entre 2 chambres pas suffisamment isolante","10"
"Martin’s place is very stylish and it feels like a true Montreal apartment. It’s a good size for 3-4 guests, with a large kitchen and a good sized TV room. It was in walking distance to some good shopping, cafes and restaurants. The bed was also very comfortable.","10"
"Great location for a great price!","10"
"Nice apartment in a great neighbourhood in Montreal. The space was clean and tidy, the beds were comfortable and we appreciated the extra blankets. The entry system was simple and easy to use. We travelled with a two year old, so we appreciated the trundle bed so he could be close to the ground.","10"
"Martin is great! The apartment is in an amazing location, stylish and has everything you will need to have a great experience in Montreal!","10"

"Appartement très chaleureux avec une déco typique dans un quartier agréable de Montréal","10"
"What a top spot!  If you're keen to have fun in Montreal with fantastic food and entertainment options this might be the place for you.  Wiht a penchant for mid century pieces and quirky styling, this is a vintage lover's treasure trove.  Gracious hosts, organised check-in and out, and excellent communication at all times.","10"

"This place is very homey however when I arrived the beds were not made but when I contacted the host he was very nice and the place was ready within a half hour
Would definitely recommend","8"
"Cedric's place is pretty good, the rooms are nice, and we got everything we need for our a home away from home. However, the floor sounds a bit when walking but it is not a big deal. overall, this is  good place to stay, will book a gain if I come to Montreal next time.
","8"
"It was a great place for a few of us girls exploring Montreal for the weekend. It was homey and had a nice kitchen for cooking. It's close to buses as well. We'd definitely stay there again.","8"
"Cédric and Christina's place had a lot of space for three of us, as well as a balcony where we could spend some time in the evening. Unfortunately, and for the first time at all, we had a really bad experience staying at the apartment. We were unable to use the front door key from the outside and found it thus impossible to leave the place. The communication with the hosts was nearly impossible for the whole time, 20 hours later they also rejected to come by because no-one had been available. Fortunately Airbnb helped us out with the case and we were able to leave, find another place to stay and still enjoy the couple of days in Montreal. Me and my friends would not recommend staying at Cédric's place.","8"
"I suppose ‘old’ and ‘in process of repair’ is the charm of Montreal in general. This apartment certainly fills that description.","8"
"We had a terrible experience here. First ever after 7 air bnb stays. The place was so dirty that we managed to get a refund through Airbnb support. 
Some of the furniture was so old it wasn’t useable anymore. This is a run down dorm room, not a nice place to stay. 
Host had strict refund policy ( of course ) but she did refund us. She charged us cleaning fees though, which was very ironic!","8"
"Nice apartment with only a couple flights of stairs, we were very comfortable and had no complaints. Very nice and quiet neighbourhood with a balcony on the back. I would recommend this place to anyone willing to walk a few minutes to a subway. ","8"
"The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","8"
"Wonderful place, wonderful location, really nice people, but the internet was a problem.  Lots of interference, it seems.","8"

"Tony was very friendly and welcoming! Flexible with the check in time.  received us at the door and took the time to show us the appartment and made sure that we communicate to him anything we needed. He left juices and snacks and told to feel free to eat them. The appartment was very comfortable and clean. The appartment is in a very nice and quiet neighborhood called LaSalle, 13 mins away from the airport in car, close to universitè Concordia . I will definitely go back and stay again.","10"
"We spent the Thanksgiving long weekend at Tony's place and felt like home. Tony was very accommodating with the check-in, the place was very clean and the fridge stacked with all necessary ingredients to have a nice breakfast.

"Tony let us stay even with such a short notice as due to airbnb problems our other place was cancelled the day we were arriving montreal. No complains at all. I would definatelly recommend.","10"
"Great compact accommodation for my family of 4. We needed a place to stay overnight before catching a plane from Montreal Airport and accommodation in the city was so expensive. Tony was so fast with answering questions and advising us places to eat which was very welcomed. He also provided us with bread, drinks and breakfast provisions which was so good as we arrived late in the afternoon and left very early the next morning. This small touch was so appreciated. We comfortably fit myself, husband and 2 older daughters in the space and although we were only there for a brief time we enjoyed it. Thanks Tony.","10"
"Tony was a great host- and this is an excellent spot to stay while visiting Montreal.  As a runner I loved how accessible many bike paths were.  You could run for miles on them.","10"

The bedroom boasted a comfortable queen size bed, nice linen and comfortable pillows and plenty of closet space and cupboards if they're necessary.  The kitchen was very clean and I appreciated the availability of eggs, butter, milk, water, bread and more, that was available for me.  There was even a washer and dryer available!

"La casa è un ampio e bel sottoscala molto tipico in una zona di Montreal che si sta riqualificando dalla quale non è difficile raggiungere il centro. L'arredamento è moderno e funzionale, con qualche raffinatezza come la vasca idromassaggio. La cucina però non è dotata di attrezzature sufficienti per più di due persone, manca una macchina del caffé, quindi è per chi non ha intenzione di cucinare in casa. La tv è utilizzabile solo come schermo per i computer, non ci sono canali visibili, non c'è una radio. La comunicazione e i servizi possono diventare  difficili perché l'host non abita vicino (com'è avvenuto a noi).","10"

"Steves Apartment #8 at 2nd floor was perfect for my baby daughter, husband and me for our 5 night stay in Montreal. Just in front of the door the 55 bus is stopping which is perfect to get around. Also the area itself the plateau mont royal is very hip and trendy. You can reach grocery stores, liquor stores, bars, Schwartz, restaurants and cafes very easy by walk less than 5 minutes. Steve is very helpful and gives his best for a comfortable stay. The apartment itself is very basic but is well equipped. We would recommend to stay here and also would come again.","9"
"Comfortable apartment with the ideal location for having fun in Montreal.  Everything you will need is within a 15-minute walk.  Steve is responsive to any questions and knows Montreal well.","9"
"Location Location, Location! You are in the hip part of the Plateau Mont Royal. Everything you need is less than a block away: greta restaurants, a fantastic grocery store with a lot of international food and vegan options, an ice cream place, a great crepe place. Don't miss the Jerk store, just next door to the apartment. Steve's place has really fast internet, but the coffee shop downstair has the best coffee, so it quickly became my office :). Oh, important detail, Steve has a really nice A/C unit in the bedroom. The place was really clean. Steve helped me get a parking spot on the next block, so I didn't have to deal with parking my car in the street. And he showed me the cool spot in the neighborhood!","9"
"We had a great stay at Steve’s place. Location was perfect and quiet. AC was much appreciated during warm days and nights. Apt was spacious and clean. Communication with Steve was easy and fast. I would definitely stay there again.","9"
"We liked the location. Steve was super responsive and overall a great host. There was an electricity breakdown at 11pm on the night of our check-in, and he sent someone to fix it. He also provided a parking space next door for an  additional fee. The bathroom was supplied with toiletries: soap, shampoo, body gels, toilet paper. 

If you are *allergic* to pets fur, this might be important to you: we found some on furniture legs in the 2nd bedroom. We spent most of the time outside exploring Montreal and it only caused reaction when we were playing on the floor with a kid, but still it isn’t something I would expect from an apartment where pets aren’t allowed. 

I hope the points above are easy to fix and recommend Steve as a great host to anyone who wants to spend some quality time in Montreal.","9"
"We had a really good stay in Steve's place. The location is top notch, the apartment is quiet and has everything you need. Steve is a great host - easy to work with, responsive and very accommodating. ","9"
"Solid place to stay and close to all the action, but not so close that you deal with all the riffraff. Steve is an excellent communicator, he’s very responsive and helpful. Had a minor issue with the air con not working, but he had someone with 10 minutes to come fix it (was a settings issue, not mechanical malfunction). Thanks again, Steve!","9"
"3rd floor apartment, great location. Good restaurants, coffee shops & bakeries nearby. Hard wood floors, no carpet...a plus in my book. Owner very responsive. Parking is available but somewhat expensive $20 CAD/night. We were there during a very hot spell & electricity went out in apartment at 1 AM. No electricity meant no AC. I messaged Steve & he responded immediately with a call to me. He determined what needed to be done. Electricity was restored by noon the next day.","9"
"This place is right in the heart of a charming neighborhood that has real character—lots of small restaurants and bars and sandwiched between two amazing parks. Coffee on the deck in the morning was relaxing. The apartment makes you feel like you’re a regular native.","9"
"Steve est un excellent hôte, réactif et arrangeant! L’appartement est très bien situé entre Plateau et Mont-Royal,  je recommande","9"
"Ish was such a great host! He was very good at communicating with me before I arrived, explaining exactly where to go and how to reach the apartment. The location is very close to the metro and bus stations as well as many of the main areas to visit while in Montreal. It was very easy to navigate on foot from the apartment to Old Port, Place Jacques Cartier, Saint Catherine St, and the metro station. I would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Great place- very clean and neat. A little further from the heart of the city than I expected but still very easy to get around.","9"
"We had a great time staying in Ish's place and would definitely recommend. Location was amazing and we were able to walk to tons of restaurants and bars. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.","9"
"I will recommend the appartment a lot. Ish is a great person who helps in whatever we need and try that our stay be better. The appartment is located in an excellent place.","9"
"L'appartement est parfait pour un séjour à Montréal. Il est très bien situé !
Tout était parfait ! Merci beaucoup !","9"
"Great location to pretty much everything downtown. Chinatown, st-catherines, Notre-Dame church etc. Everything is pretty much walking distance. Very clean, WiFi & Netflix available. Very safe neighbourhood - right next to a police station. Definitely would stay here again. 

If you are driving, there's not much parking downtown so beware.","9"
"The apartment was very welcoming and cozy. Very close to restaurants and bars and coffee shops. Only about 15 minute walk to Old Montreal, and a shopping mall very close by. Awesome stay clean place five stars","9"
"Très bon séjour ! Appartement proche des restaurants et tout le nécessaire pour un bon séjour à Montreal. Il est très facile de communiquer avec l'hôte en cas d'interrogations. Les points negatifs sont l'absence de parking gratuit à proximité, et des rideaux pas suffisamment opaques pour la lumière du jour le matin à mon goût.  (mais ce n'est que mon avis). J'y reviendrais tout de même avec plaisir !","9"
"Nous sommes restés 2 semaines dans ce studio et nous avons passé un agréable séjour. Super bien situé, à proximité du quartier chinois, du complexe Desjardins et du métro. A 15 - 20 min à pied du quartier du vieux port.","9"
"Excellent communication and location. Exactly what was expected.","9"
"Appartement conforme à la description. Internet très haut débit, bien situé et accès facile. 
Le lit un peu trop mou et un manque d’accessoires pour cuisiner. 
Je n’ai pas eu la chance de rencontrer Ish.","9"
"Great appartement with a very good connection to public transport. 
Ish is a kind host and replied fast to our questions. He was even flexible with the check out, which was really great for us!
The appartement is quite and clean. 
We would stay there again and recommend it.","9"
"Close walk to China Town and main metro station (Berri UQAM).  Coffee shops and restaurants are around the corner and Old Montreal is only a few more minutes past China Town.","9"
"In a prime and super convenient location! Wasn’t enough toilet paper for the 3 nights we stayed there and the kitchen doesn’t have any baking sheets or anything to put in the oven if you’re planning on using the oven. Other than that prime location! Cozy and warm.","9"
"Ish's place is great! Located very close to the convention center and china town, I was able to walk home for quick breaks. The bed was also very comfortable, so it was easy to fall asleep at night. This place was everything I needed.","9"
"Ish's place was pretty awesome! The listing is very accurate - a cute bachelor suite with a spacious bathroom, and lots of natural light. Ish was also very accommodating, and we definitely appreciated that! The best thing about the apartment was the location - minutes to EVERYTHING! It's nestled between the four vstly different neighbourhoods of downtown, gay village, old Montreal and St-Denis/St-Laurent strips. We couldn't have asked for a better spot. IGA is a couple of blocks away too, as well as a number of major bus routes, so it was super easy to get around!! I would totally book this place again, SO worth it. (internet was super slow, but no biggie since we spent most of our time out and about).","9"
"Place was great, exactly as described. The place was very stylish and in an excellent location.","9"
"Place was perfect for me, it was a walking distance to restaurant and shopping center. Great location.","9"
"Great location. Close to metro stops, bust stops and restaurants. The place was very clean and cozy. Would definitely  recommend staying here while in Montreal!","9"
"This appartment is very comfortable, clean and very well located. The description is really accurate, you are minutes on foot to anywhere downtown. Ish is very communicative and responses nearly instantly. This was especially useful in my case as I had trouble with the access card. Make extra caution not to place the card near a magnetic field (magnet, phone...) or you will not be able to get in ;-) Ish however was very helpful and solved this for me very quickly. Also, a new door access system will be put in place in the upcoming weeks in the building so this issue will probably disappear with it. To summarise I stayed there for 3 weeks for work and I would highly recommend it! Great place for the price range!","9"
"Très bon accueil et excellente communication. L'appartement est propre et bien conçu et proche de la place des arts.","9"
"Cannot say enough good things about this host and flat in Old Montreal. Ish got back to us immediately if we had any concerns and the place was exactly as described if not better. the location is great, right in the heart of all the action and walking distance to whatever you need. would highly recommend staying here  ","9"
"Convenient location. Quiet and secure. View consists of apartment block across the street. Soft bed. Clean, spacious bath. Large functional kitchen. Good value for money.","9"
"This place is perfect for anyone just wanting to chill and see Montreal it’s in the perfect location, safe ,clean and walking distance to so much stuff to do and see no need for cabs or bus. The place itself was super clean and just had a home vibe to it I will be coming back for sure next year and I would recommend anyone to stay here!!!","9"
"Place was clean and a great location. Walking distance from everything you needed and Ish provided details before hand on where everything was which was helpful. One downside, which host could not control, door to get into building was broken. Would have to wait for someone to show up to get in. Also bed wasn’t the most comfortable other then that it was a great stay would stay again. ","9"
"Great location with easy check in, clean and a great host! Will definitely stay here again.","9"
"This past weekend August 24-26 was my first time staying at an Airbnb. Based on the information provided and the reviews it was a good stay but could be improved (3.7 out of 5 star). The place was clean. The location was good; about 10-20 minutes walk from most things. Check-in was easy although in my opinion could be improved in ways that I won't address. There are toiletries and the daily basic home stuff you could use. There is NO onsite parking but there are some lots for about 15 dollars/night that took me some time to find; an exact address of a parking lot would've been very helpful after a long 7 hours drive. The biggest concern for my boyfriend and I was the bed. The bed was too soft and sunk in (the middle of the bed) for our liking. It made our sleep very uncomfortable to the point we kept trying to move to the side to get the flat surface but would eventually end up back in the middle sunk in. I understand that it could've been due to the uses of it overtime. I think that it could easily be fixed by investing in a new mattress. Another thing that I noticed was all the bedding stuff and towels smelt like the febreze that was in the washroom. I'm not sure if the detergent used to wash has the same smell but that was what I noticed. Overall, it was a good first stay. Thank you Ish!","9"
"Ish, was an amazing host. Everything was spotless. He left towels, a few dishes, bathroom essential, TV (with Netflix available) all to be used by the guest. It was close to shopping centers (supermarket, cinema, SAQ, metro...etc). The pictures do not lie, exactly what is photographed is what you will enjoy. If all these suit your desires of a trip in Montreal, Ish’s apartment is the one for you.","9"
"Ish's place was perfect for our long weekend in Mtl - great place and fantastic location!","9"
"This apartment is as it appears in the photos. The location is excellent for a tourist.","9"
"I had a great experience at Ish’s place. It was very clean and spacious with a very functional kitchen. Location is great too as it is walking distance to the old town, down town,  gay village and Metro stations. There are also plenty of cafes and restaurants withing walking distance. I had a great time.","9"
"Ok stay","9"
"Great location, secure building, fast communication with host, lots to do near the residence and great value. Would highly recommend. Thank you","9"
"Very nice apartment, very convenient and very easy arrival and departure","9"
"Location is great","9"
"l'appartement de Ish est très bien situé et pratique.  Bémol :
la literie est trop souple.","9"
"Excellente location","9"
"Bonito departamento, excelente ubicación, seguro y bonito, todo funcionando bien, esta muy cerca de todo 100%recomendable.

Todas las instrucciones que nos dio fueron buenas.","9"
"we asked hair dryer and Ish responded very quickly. bed was uncomfortable and overall place was not super clean.","9"
"Ish was very helpful in ensuring my stay was very comfortable. The unit is spacious and at a great location","9"
"Great location, near public transportation/restaurants, and what even appears to be a police station next door, felt very safe.  A good place for a few days. However, as some people have said, the bed is uncomfortable and sinks quite a lot in the middle. It would be good for a single person, but as a couple, it felt like we were falling in towards each other and made it difficult to sleep with our backs twisted. I understand beds sink over time, but it should probably be replaced. The shower curtain is a very thin material and it looks like it can tear easily so be careful when pulling it back. The floors are wood and tile, so if you visit in the winter be careful with your shoes and be mindful of the winter salt/melting snow. Also, for those not used to city living, there are two doors when entering the building, the first door must close before the second door can unlock. If the first door is held open or hasn't shut, the second won't open at all.","9"
"would recommend!","9"
"Very nice place to stay, easy access. Would recommend.","9"
"Ish is a kind and responsible host, clean room and commendations for guests!","9"
"Excellent emplacement et apparement très cozy!","9"
"Emplacement idéal au centre ville de Montréal, pratique et convivial.","9"
"Location!! location!! location!! It is super convenient to take public transportation to basically anywhere in Montreal. It is in a quiet neighborhood. Super market is 10 steps from the apartment. There is street parking. Just ask some locals if you have trouble reading the signs. We had requested late Check-In and Ian was able to accommodate our request. The place is a basement apartment and has all basic stuff plus some goodies. Nice and clean.","9"
"really enjoyed the stay was clean and good.","9"
"très bon appartement, séjour génial, allez-y les yeux fermés !","9"
"Great place to stay","9"
"Le logement correspond bien à la description et le sous traitant qui le gère est très sympa, mais attention à deux choses : il était très humide quand nous y étions, alors que ce n'était pas le cas dehors, et il ne faut surtout PAS utiliser les laveuse et sécheuse que le propriétaire met gentiment à disposition de ses clients si vous ne voulez pas retrouver vos affaires pleines de trous. Dans mon cas, deux t shirts neufs sont passés à la poubelle, ce qui est vraiment rageant","9"
"Ian was very communicative and the place was accurate to the pictures.  It is perfect if you need a place to ""crash"" sleep in Montréal.  It is close to a Metro station *and* a grocery store.  Neighborhood was quiet (we stayed early September)","9"
"Location is great, steps from supermarket, buses, and metro.
My wife and I enjoyed our stay at this property and we had no issues.
Bueses and metro trains take you anywhere in greater Montreal even to Laval.","9"
"Great place. Expected nothing less. Cool location. No hassle. I will definitly come again to Ian's place.","9"
"Belle apparentement à proximité des restaurants, transports en communs et à 15 minutes du centre ville. La rapidité du wi-fi un peu lente, il n'y avait pas de fer à repasser et la douche ne fonctionnait pas adéquatement","9"
"Nice and quiet place. Close to transportation and commodities.","9"
"Excellente location. Excellent service","9"
"Ian's place was a really great place to stay while we were in MTL. Very close to the downtown core via Snowdon subway station around the corner. Highly recommended","9"
"Absolutely perfect location. A a busy corner with shops restaurants grocery stores and the Metro but yet a quiet apartment which was spotlessly clean. Ian was very responsive to my questions and a small problem with the TV was handled very quickly.","9"
"This basement apartment is perfect for a couple.  Great location, walking distance to shops, restaurants and the metro.  Very modern and clean.  Check-in was very easy and the girls helpful.  

The TV only has one cable channel, so you probably want to bring Apple TV or something and there are only 2 very thin pillows.

Parking is on the street!

Overall a great please to stay and will use it again :O)  Thank you!","9"
"Bed is not that comfy. Shower needs fixing. But other then that I loved it. Ian was so nice, metro just at the corner (late night snacks). Worth the price !","9"
"Super appart dans un quartier émouvant de montreal. J'ai beaucoup aimer l'accueil d , ian est tres sympa, il répond rapidement aux messages , j'ai beaucoup aimer la Tranquillité  du lieu  puis la propriété. Je recommande à 100% et j'espère y retourner éventuellement . 
Merci ian :-)","9"
"This was a nice place. It looked newly renovated and was very spacious and comfortable. There were amenities close by. We drove and found that there were parking spaces on the street nearby. We didn't make much use of the subway, but there was one close by. Overall the cost was well worth it.","9"
"Ian place is nice, clean and close to everything. He is a great host, i would recommend it !!","9"
"Belle  place  est situé  proche  du centre ville","9"
"Nice clean place close to shops and transportation.","9"
"Interior design was beautiful. I love how everything inside the place was arranged. Food, grocery store, and transit was all walking distance. REMEMBER: Place is behind the building in the basement which was difficult for us to find. I highly recommend everyone to consider staying at this beautiful home. Definitely coming back here in the future!","9"
"L'appartement est très bien situé.  
Confortable.  Moderne.
Le point fort la proximité de 2 commerces et du métro.  
Astuce éviter de prendre la voiture car même si il y du parking dans la rue adjacent c pas gratuit.  
Point à améliorer l humidité.  On a laissé là ventilation de la sdb tt le long.
Appartement q ns recommandons","9"
"Appartement propre avec une grande baignoire et bien équipé. Tres prochede commerces et du métro 
Par contre l acces par une arriere cours peu accueillante,  a notee que l apt est en soussol : peu de lumiere, ce qui nous a pas gener car nous y etions surtout pour dormir, pour la tele il faut avoir le systeme avec le smart phone
Nous avons beaucoup aime cet apt qui correspondait a nos besoins, tres bon rapport qualite/ prix. ","9"
"Ran out of hot water during shower

Parking was a bit difficult 

Late check in not available ","9"
"Very uncomfortable/regrettable stay.  This, in fact, is 1/2 of a basement on the 1/2 ground level. While the interior of the spaces matches the photos, what was not shown is the path that you have to walk thru to get to your basement apt entrance. After spending 10-15 min searching for a parking spot every night, you walk into a dark alley (about 10m), with smelly garbage dumped on both side of the alley. At / end of alley, turn left and you walk into 2 cars semi blocking the entrance to the basement units. There are woods and other dumps and garbage in the vicinity. There are spider webs that you will walk right into your face. You will have to squeeze thru 2 vehicles w/o dirtying your clothes before you get to  Ft dr #1. Unlock  dr #1, you walk into an unfinished hallway w/ woods piling in front of dr #2, which open into the basement apt. Imagine if you are dressed in some nice clothes, walking thru the above 3-4 times a day from the apt to yr car.  The place is very uncomfortable for following facts. 1. There is no bedboard, so you cannot sit up & read in bed. 2. The humidity in the unit is extremely high. There is a Dehumidifier put away in a small closet room, but we were not informed until we found it on the 2nd night. When i say extremely high, I meant you cannot even sit in the room w/o sweating. We use the dehumidifier (did not help much), and every 10 hrs or so, we need to empty a tank of water fr the dehumidifier tank before it overflows. 3. The outdoor temp at night after 9 pm during our stays (Aug 29-Sept 4) is < 20c. But the inside temp is at 28c. With the humidity and heat, we did not sleep for > 4 hrs per night. 4. On the 4th night, we found a fan (dusty and semi-working) in the closet room. It did little help after we have to wash off the dust on the fan. 5. We inform Ian that we are very uncomfortable & his reply was to buy a fan valued up to $40 and he will refund.  My message to Ian: Hi Ian. We are three nights into our stay and each night has been very uncomfortable. Even last night at 3am it was 28.5^C. Too warm, humid and hard to breathe. As we aren’t even able to open a window. Outside was under 20C Is there anything you can do to make or stay more tolerable. In addition to the comfortability issues, I also wanted to note a few things that are broken: The dryer handle The coffee machine ---------- Ian reply : Hello, maybe you can buy a fan up to 40$ that I would refund you? I have photos, videos to support my claim. Message me on F/b if anyone want to see.","9"
"Ian's place is great. It has everything you could need, including a washing machine and tumble dryer. It's located very conveniently to the nearby station Snowdon that takes you straight to downtown or Old Montreal. There's also a McDonalds nearby if you fancy breakfast! A nice touch was that the TV has a Chromecast for those nights when you feel like watching silly videos on YouTube. This airbnb definitely made my trip worth it.","9"
"Enjoyed our weekend in Montreal. Very clean and spacious room. Great communication with owner and helpers. Good and quite location. Metro is 5 min walk which was a key. NO parking but we got lucky with street parking and had no issues. Recommend and will come back to this place","9"
"Its a great little apartment, but it was a bit smaller than i thought, otherwise great stay, owner was helpful and communicated well. Would definitely recommend.","9"
"Appartement très bien situé à deux pas des commerces, restaurants station de métro et site touristique. 
Parfait pour une nuit ou 2. Appartement en demi sous sol donc un peu humide et sombre","9"
"Appartement bien pour quelques jours mais pas sur du long terme car sombre du fait que les fenêtres donnent à hauteur du sol. Literie confortable.","9"
"Cozy space tucked away near the Snowdon Metro Station","9"
"Appartement très propre et cosy. Les images reflètent parfaitement la réalité! à 2 min de la station métro et proche d'un supermarché, donc c'est très bien situé","9"
"Nice apartment and great value.","9"
"Very clean, modern, excellent downtown location. Within walking distance to everything we needed. Would definitely stay again.","10"
"Jose is an awesome host. We had some nice social time with her chatting and she even shared an evenings meal with us unexpectedly. She is there to meet your every need and she has a great space to stay in. It is clean, large, the bed is very comfortable and it is very welcoming. There are many shops, restaurants and coffee shops that you can walk to in 2 minutes and the river is 2 minutes the other way. We loved exploring Pointe Claire, Dorval and Lachine which are very close to her and there is a beautiful and safe cycling route all the way into Montreal. Thank you Jose for being such a caring and interesting host.  We would recommend staying at her place!","10"
"Jose is Super Nice and Interesting : ) Her roommate Marlene is very friendly. Her cat is cute and fluffy! Our room is spacious and clean and full of artistic decorations. It's a lovely town with lots of water around. 5 star experience!","10"
"The place was spotless and very spacious. We felt perfectly at home even thought the thought of staying in another persons home sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable. In the morning we were recommend to a delightful coffee shop down the road with beautiful art. The area is beautiful for walking by the river and has delightful shops. The host was absolutely lovely and I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone.","10"
"You will love everything about Jose's place and surroundings.
Renata","10"
"This is a keeper. Great location by being quiet and also closed to the Pointe-Claire touristic street with coffee shops and bakeries. The hospitality is awesome with a beautiful and clean room with a king size bed. We will come back and I highly recommend Jose's place.","10"
"A nice, clean with a good location and the best of the good people .","10"
"Logerment idéalement situé dans le petit village de Pointe-Claire, pittoresque à souhait avec quelques maisons pluri-centenaires, ce qui est suffisamment rare en Amérique du Nord pour être mentionné. A l’étage d’une maison sans doute bien ancienne, dans une ruelle qui donne sur le fleuve, une grande chambre lumineuse, manifestement récemment mordernisée, avec un dressing et une salle de bain (Website hidden by Airbnb) d’une douche à l’italienne très spacieuse. À noter, un vaste lit - un vrai king size - très très confortable, on y passerait sa journée! L’hôte est une délicieuse dame d’origine hollandaise, installée au Canada depuis 1956, très amicale. Elle vit en compagnie d’un petit chat plein de poils, très timide, et d’une autre personne dont la chambre se situe à l’étage, comme notre logement, mais qui était absente pour les fêtes.
Au total, entière satisfaction!","10"
"Jose's place is awesome! I was staying in town after writing an exam in Pointe-Claire. I was greeted right away at the door and whisked inside to join her and her friend for an awesome meal. Very lucky that they had decided to share there meal and some great conversation with me. I went to bed early and got up and left on the morning of a big storm in Montreal, so unfortunately I did not get to say goodbye. Hoping to stay again when I next write an exam in Pointe-Claire.

Cheers,","10"
"Wonderful hostess and location.  Lovely, clean and comfortable bedroom.  Highly recommend it.","10"
"This is the second time I've stayed at Jose's place, and it was even better this time! Marlene is a total sweetheart and awesome cook and let us try some of her amazing food. It was definitely like coming home again. Pointe Claire village is as charming as always, with lovely shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance of the house. I will definitely stay again.","10"
"Séjour tranquille et grande chambre comfortable . Représentante de l’hôtesse était sympathique. De plus accommodante puisque je devenais partir très tôt le matin et n’a pas causé de problèmes.","10"
"Nous avons été très bien accueillis, la chambre est grande et agréable et les environs sont très jolis.","10"
"Jose was a wonderful host...warm, friendly and just a lovely person.  The space was just as pictured and exactly as described.  It was a very large, nicely decorated room with a super comfortable king size bed.  Beautiful new bathroom, just outside the room, and lots of space to hang your clothes etc. in the alcove of the room itself.  There was a small fridge, and tea and a kettle as well as a welcome bowl of fresh fruit. The location was terrific...half an hour drive from downtown Montreal, about a 1 minute walk to downtown Pointe Claire and 1 minute walk to the water .  This was an oasis of peace and quiet.","10"
"Jose was so lovely.  She made me tea and we shared a lemon loaf while chatting.  Her roommate was equally friendly, and was so interesting.  The room looked like a hotel room, and the shower was really nice.  This is such a convenient location in Pointe-Claire.","10"
"This place was so cute! I loved the room and the king sized bed! There was a little nook in the room with a mini fridge which was perfect for me because I brought a lot of my own food. The place was easy to find and very close to adorable shops and a scenic lake! We loved our stay!","10"
"I stayed only one short night at Jose's place and everything is simply perfect, the warm welcome from Jose who makes you feel at home, the room is spacious and very clean with all the amenities, the bed is big and let you sleep like a baby. I highly recommend this place :-)","10"
"Jose's place was perfect! It is in a great location in the Pointe Claire village. The room is large, clean and the bed is extremely comfortable. We were staying in Pointe Claire to visit family and we loved staying at Jose's - it was so welcoming. Jose is extremely warm and pleasant. We enjoyed chatting with her and meeting her sweet cat. We had a very positive experience and we will definitely stay here again!","10"
"That was our second time at Jose’s place. Again it was awesome. The king bed is so confortable and the sector is charming. Above all, Jose is a superb host. My wife and I will be back when we have to stay in Montreal.","10"
"Jose’s place was exactly as advertised. She was very friendly and welcoming and the room was perfect. I will definitely stay again if I find myself in the area.","10"
"The room was a great size - plenty of space and I appreciated the small fridge and the ample closet space. As someone who grew up in the neighborhood I am very familiar with the location and enjoyed the time when I was not visiting family to meander about and enjoy the local cafes and shops. I highly recommend the location. Jose was a great host and very welcoming.","10"
"Great place and a super hostess!!!","10"
"Great place to stay - just a block away from the Village where there are lots of lovely shops. Jose is an amicable and cordialhost, always very helpful offering me tea and snacks. I will definitely stay there during my next visit to Montreal.  The room had a comfy king size bed and there is lots of room. It is truly a good deal .  Thank you.","10"
"Host was kind and welcoming. Location was fantastic, just steps away from the water front and a beautiful park in one direction, and 30 seconds away from the bustling main street in the other. Beautiful weather saw the streets alive as folks took to the streets to check out all the lovely shops and cafés.","10"
"Wonderful host lovely clean bright comfortable room. The location in the village is perfect. Terrific restaurants and beautiful walks. We will stay there again.","10"
"Jose was very nice! her place was nicely renovated upstairs and the bathroom was gorgeous. The bed was one of the most comfy ones I've slept on! 

A quiet little down with many small bars and restaurants within walking distance. 

Highly recommended! will definitely be back!","10"
"The space is exactly as advertised; a private home with modern amenities (TV, small fridge, coffee maker, air conditioner).  The bed is divine!   Jose and her roommate were very warm and welcoming.  The location is perfect; only a block from the lakefront, coffee shops, boutiques and markets.  Public transit runs along Lakeshore.  There is a sweet cat on the premises who doesn't come upstairs.  The guest washroom is shared with one person but this was never an issue.  Excellent value! I highly recommend Jose's house for those looking for peace, comfort and convenience.","10"
"Jose and her home were wonderful!  I fear sharing this great place as I would like it available every time I pass through and visit.","10"
"Reviews were accurate. If you are in the Montreal area and want a fabulous place to stay then look no further than Jose’s place.  Five star bed and bathroom. Jose is an excellent host and a wealth of information about the area.","10"
"Jose's place was great, the room is comfortable, squeeky clean and quiet. The shared bathroom is modern and very nice. Jose is accommodating, fast to respond and very nice as well. It's a home away from home.","10"

Et José est charmante ! On ne peut demander plus !","10"
"Jose's place is amazing and Jose is a lovely host with so much knowledge to share.  The shower is one of the nicest showers I've ever used and the bed is extremely comfortable.  The neighborhood has a great village feel with a sailing club, swimming pool and large park along with restaurants and shops.  All in all a great experience.","10"
"Jose and Usha were great hosts. Very receptive and accommodating. The location is absolutely perfect for a visit to Pointe-Claire. Situated close to everything within walking distance. The space is great and well setup. We would highly recommend visiting.

"What a surprise to find this place. Pointe Claire is a quaint little town with so much character & friendliness and only minutes from downtown Montreal. Jose is so warm and welcoming and her home is clean and comfortable. I really liked the big bedroom and big shower. I hope to stay here again on my return visit.","10"
"Jose's house is in a nice little town with history going back to American Indians, a block from bars and restaurants, two blocks from the river. We actually had pretty much all upstairs for our-self - very private. The room and a private bathroom are freshly renovated and everything is sparkling clean. Jose is a great host with stories to tell. We will definitely stay over there every time we are in the area.
Jose, thank you for all your hospitality.","10"
"This is a wonderful place right by the water. Jose was a truly professional host. The suite upstairs is like a luxury hotel room. She knew I was there to get some work done so she left me to myself yet still was very friendly when we crossed paths. Tip for those doing a similar work holiday: half a block one way is the serene water, half a block another way (on St. Anne's) is a great yoga studio with drop in classes, half a black another way is a pool with lane swimming for $5. Great stay and fantastic host!","10"
"Thanks for all Jose.","10"
"Jose 's place is very nice. Clean, cozy, comfortable. The room was big enough, big bed, clean and big bathroom. You feel like your home and Jose' s hospitality is excellent. If you are in Montreal and you want a great,  quiet place to stay , you must book to Jose' s.","10"
"It was an absolute delight staying at Jose's house and she was a fantastic host.  I would definitely stay there again!","10"
"Jose is a fantastic host, thoughtful and respectful. Her house is charming and eclectic, and the proximity of Pointe-Claire village and the lake truly made my stay feel like a holiday. Highly recommend.","10"
"I enjoyed the hospitality at Jose's place very much.  Pointe-Claire is a suburb of Montreal but has an entirely different, laid-back feel than staying in the city centre.  It is well connected by bus (journey takes 45 mins to an hour) and saves the hassle of finding parking in the city.  Jose was very welcoming.  We enjoyed the upgraded features in the upstairs of her home (beautiful shower, classy lighting in the bedroom, all amenities for preparing tea/coffee in the dressing room, and air conditioning!) and we enjoyed the helpful local tips from Jose herself -- a great experience.","10"
"We had a most wonderful stay with Jose!  The location of her home is right in the heart of the enchanted Pointe-Claire village:  the sprawling lake front is 2 mins down her street, and all the charming amenities of the main street are 2 mins up from her home. Jose is the epitome of hospitable, welcoming, helpful.  She's a pleasure to interact with and her home was a pleasure to stay in.  We look forward to our next stay with you, Jose! ","10"
"The house is cute and comfortable. The rooms are bright and the view of the neighborhood is quaint. The king size bed feels like a cloud, I haven’t been that comfy in I don’t know how long. The extra bed room is also cute and looks like if you are traveling with a child it would be perfect(even with out AC). The windows in the home are usually open letting in a very nice breeze off of the lake. The bathroom is aesthetically pleasing and very clean. The host (Jose)is very helpful and kind and informative. She has newspaper clips and brochures of things that are in the area and gave us tips on things to do. Her home is right at the shore and a windmill from 1709 so the walks always seem to have an amazing view, especially accompanied with some ice cream from a little shop around the corner from her place. The town seems to have a very safe feel, to the point that you could be comfortable sending your children out to play without worry. I would recommend this home and host to anyone. Definitely an experience I am glad I took the time for. ","10"
"Second time...and always perfect,  Jose is a warm and generous host ! The room is very comfortable ! Nice coffee shops close by ....don't hesitate !! Great place  !

"Johns suite was everything i hoped for, central to nightlife, steps away from old port, the location was brilliant. 

The apartment itself was fantastic, and everything was sparkling clean, nice comfy space, with a really nice bed. The amenities was an added bonus, not a single issue. Would definitely stay again.","10"

"John's place is really nice and clean; very well located, near walking of main tourist attractions. Also, near metro station Place D'Arms. I sure recommend John's place.","10"
"We were very happy with John's place as it is in an ideal location. It is walking distance to the metro and to old Montreal which is great for anyone visiting the city. The check-in was simple and seamless. The apartment itself had everything that was needed and I liked the fact that there were several toiletries available for use in case you forgot anything (shampoo, conditioner etc.). However, the apartment faces another building so there is not much of a view if you are looking for that. That being said, location cannot be beat and for the most part we only came back to the apartment for sleep. All in all this was a great experience and we appreciate John's timely responses whenever we had a question. Thank you for your hospitality !","10"
"The condo is in an excellent location for exploring both old and new Montreal. The place itself was very clean and quiet and John provided easy instructions for guests to follow and was very responsive to any questions. Highly recommend!","10"

"Great location . Very clean . Secure building . Make sure you park across the street for the best rates .","10"
"This property was absolutely perfect. It was in an amazing location, impeccably clean, well stocked with towels, toiletries, kitchen equipment and had a washer/dryer. John was incredibly prompt with communication and opened the unit within an hour of my enquiring if it was available! I can't find fault with anything about my stay. I even made use of the gym in the hotel which was free with the property. I would highly recommend this property for single or couple travellers. It offers everything you need and in a really beautiful place. ","10"
"Superb.  Best we have experienced out of six or seven rentals.  Convenient and well-managed.","10"

N’hésitez pas, c’est une adresse sûre ;)","10"
"A nice little place to stay and very convenient to the convention center and surrounding area.","10"
"Great unit and host! Strongly  recommend it","10"
"The apartment is very pretty. It is right next to Montreal's convention center, which comes in handy when you visit for a conference. It is also in the Old Montreal which, tourist-wise, I think is the best place to walk around. What I enjoyed the most was the amenities, e.g. iron, shampoo&conditioner, cooking supplies. John has been very responsive and easy to communicate with. I enjoyed my stay very much!","10"
"This place is everything you could need in a Montreal AirBnB. It’s stylish and homey, centrally located (near buses and subways), in a safe and secure building and with all of the amenities you need. I will choose this place every time!","10"
"John's place was elegant and had everything we needed. We felt so lucky to be in a beautiful apartment in such a convenient location for our vacation. John was communicative and accommodating.","10"

 Je vous le conseille.","9"
"Accueil sympa et chaleureux. Nos hôtes font tout pour qu'on se sente à l'aise et bienvenus! Plusieurs petites attention très appréciées (café et coin repas pour le déjeuner). Je recommande chaudement cette hôte!","9"
"Super hôte. Andréanne est dévouée à vous faire passer un agréable séjour.","9"
"Hôtes très sympathiques! Intimité au sous-sol et près du metro. J'y retournerais sans hésiter!","9"
"We had a great stay at Adréanne & David's place. They are both amazing people, very welcoming and caring. They always asked if we had anything we needed and answered all our questions. Apart from that everything was very clean and you kinda have the entire basement to yourself which is great!","9"
"Chez Andréane, il ne manque rien. Un endroit spacieux, meublé, tout près du métro et d'une des attractions touristiques principales de Montréal (biodome, jardin botanique, planétarium). Nous avons fait beaucoup de bonnes expériences avec Airbnb, mais cette fois là, impossible de trouver mieux !","9"
"Très bon accueil. Des hôtes prêts à donner tout conseil pour faire le meilleur séjour possible. Logement bien confortable. Je recommande!","9"
"We were very impressed with our overnight stay here and would definitely stay again on a subsequent trip to Montreal. This family went out of their way to accommodate our needs. The location was perfect for us......walking distance from the Olympic Stadium!","9"
"My daughter and I had a fantastic weekend attending the Gymnastics World Championships. The home was so close to the Olympic Stadium, it made coming and going to the events there stress-free. We could walk everywhere. Our hosts were open, accommodating and responsive. We had fun exploring the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighbourhood, enjoying Thanksgiving poutine at Gerry's Delicatessen, delicious baking and coffee from the counter at Marché Maisonneuve and a pub dinner at Le Blind Pig.","9"
"La même accueil que si nous serions allé chez des amis de longue date. Un séjour très agréable une maison charmante. Nous recommandons à tous !!! Merci encore !!","9"
"Tranquille et privé. Un séjour fort agréable.","9"
"station de métro très proche.
salle de bain avec grande douche à  l'italienne.
le fait que le logement soit semi-enterré n'est pas gênant ( sensation de cocon ).
petite cour-jardinet au calme, très agréable dès qu'il y a un rayon de soleil.","9"
"Andreanne was great on communication and has the best possible setup for a short stay or long term visit. Would for sure stay here again","9"
"I enjoyed my first air bnb experience staying at  Andreanne's home. The private entrance, bathroom, sitting area and bedroom that could lock made me feel secure and like I had my own space. The house is so close to the metro station that I used transit for my whole 4-day visit and that saved a lot of money. She was generous and had a re-loadable transit card, travel guides, milk and coffee available. Everything was clean and welcoming. Being so close to the Olympic Stadium and all of its activities made it easy to check out the attractions and there is a Cineplex movie theatre right there, too. Nice when travelling with children. She was always responsive to my questions and texted back quickly. I would recommend without a doubt for anyone who wants an easy, enjoyable experience.","9"
"Excellent endroit pour séjourner le temps d'un week-end à Montréal! Le fait d'être près du métro est un avantage indéniable de même que l'entrée indépendante. De plus, Andréanne et son copain sont très gentils.","9"
"If you are attending an event at the Olympic Stadium or visiting Montreal in general, this is the place to stay! Andréanne and her husband could not have been nicer and made me feel completely welcome in their home. Their space was extremely clean and was full of helpful amenities.","9"
"I would highly recommend staying with Andreanne and her family. I have stayed at a few Airbnb before, but this one was by far the best. They deserve a 10star review. Next time I travel to Montreal, I’m staying here 100%","9"
"Andréanne is an excellent communicator, and she went out of her way to accommodate us. We arrived late and she organized our check in very well. The space is beautiful, better than the pictures and has everything you would need. It feels kind of like a little apartment in the basement, and it does have a separate entrance to the basement, making things even more private. I liked this because I felt I could go in and out at night without bothering Andréanne and her family. The neighbourhood had plenty of parking and was quiet but a short drive to everything.","9"
"L'emplacement est génial et la chambre avec cuisinette est très pratique! Le prix est un peu cher pour ce quartier, mais l'accueil est très chaleureux.","9"
"Simplement, un séjour génial!! Andréanne et son conjoint sont des hôtes super sympas et très agreables! La chambre est fidèle aux photos, très propre. La maison est à 5 minutes à pied du métro et en 10 minutes on est dans le centre ville. On se sent en sécurité. Autour de la maison il y a plusieurs restaurants et cafés. Si vous pensez séjourner à Montréal n’hésitez pas et aller chez Andreanne!","9"
"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Andréanne et David! Ils ont été très réactifs pour nous recevoir et extrêmement acceuillant!
Le logement est très propre, bien équipé et bien décoré et ce, a quelques pas des transports en commun et du jardin botanique!
Merci beaucoup! Si c etait a refaire nous renouvellerions l'expérience sans hésiter!","9"
"Wonderful people, great hospitality, awesome room and space to stay.","9"
"Clean, quiet and well located near the Olympic park.  Everything you need for a short stay in Montreal.","9"
"Andreanne’s place was great for us. It was perfectly located for our needs, clean, comfortable and affordable. Our trip was enhanced through our experience of getting to know our hosts a bit and their efforts in making our stay comfortable, convenient and enjoyable. We would not hesitate to re-book.","9"
"The apartment is perfectly situated in the hearth of Plateau Mt-Royal : the Mt-Royal metro station, groceries, restaurants are just a few steps away.  The host was responsive to our needs, providing a phone so we could make call using our Magic Jack via the internet as no land line is available.  We rented for 1 month and Martin was an excellent host.","10"
"This is a very quaint, comfortable 1-bedroom apartment on the main floor of a typical Montreal row house.  It is located in a great area of the city - le Plateau - where you are surrounded by quiet streets for strolling, trendy bars, cafés and restaurants, and unique shopping that Montreal is known for.  We drove to Montreal and overnight street parking was readily available, once you figured out the signage and what sections of the street were non-permit.  The neighbours were also very helpful to point out when we got it wrong, saving us a potential ticket!!  Martin was nice to deal with.  Although we didn't get to meet in person, communication with him was easy - phone, text, email and thru AirBNB.  Check-in and out was easy, and we felt very safe and secure.  The apartment has an alarm system and we were introduced on paper to the upstairs neighbour, who we then met in person over the course of the weekend.  The apartment is clean and the beds are comfortable.  The  bedroom is large (king size bed) and is off the front side of the house, but the street is fairly quiet, so street noise wasn't an issue.  There is no central air conditioning, but a fan in the bedroom and portable a/c unit in the living room.  We were there on a very hot, sticky weekend, and didn't find the apartment overly hot, nor did we need the a/c.  Although well equipped, we didn't do any cooking in the kitchen, apart from making tea.  But we did prepare a nice snack of wine, cheese, crackers, meat, grapes… which we enjoyed sitting out on the quiet and sunny back deck area.  Having this outside space was very nice.  The apartment is also equipped with a washer/dryer - so handy for longer stays.  Decent shower/tub with good water pressure - there is no exhaust fan though, so the room does steam up, making it a bit hard to towel dry.  The only real quirk for us... the toilet is in a small ""closet"" at the front of the house - literally just room for the toilet - while the shower/tub/sink is in a separate room at the back of the house.  So you have to walk through the dining/living room & kitchen to wash your hands after using the toilet.  Looking back at the photos, we can see this now, but it is not obvious and was a bit of a surprise for us.  Overall though, we were very happy with the apartment.  Great price, great location, great weekend!","10"
"The place is super cozy. Very clean and spacious. Close to metro station, shared bikes stations, supermarkets and lots of restaurants. Everything you need is within easy reach. The BBQ station is a lot of fun, especially considering the great selection of amazing sausage at the European market on St.Laurent which is just 10 min away by bike. Martin (the host) was very welcoming and helpful. There was a problem with Wi-Fi, he quickly arranged the fix. Great overall experience!","10"
"Martin est un hôte extra, très accueillant et disponible. On a vécu deux mois exceptionnels dans son appartement, ou l'on s'est tout de suite senti très bien car il s'en dégage une grande sérénité et il est très chaleureux. Il est idéalement situé, en plein cœur du Plateau, tout près du metro, de pleins de beaux parcs et d'une multitude de bons commerces. On a tout particulièrement adoré profiter de la terrasse et du barbecue! Bref, on recommanderait les yeux fermés ce logement à tous nos proches et encore merci a Martin et Sarah de leur accueil!","10"
"Martin is an amazing host. He is very communicative and available. Check-in was easy and the place is truly a zen house. I used to live in Montreal so new location was best for those wanting to live the local life but his place is truly next to everything. From wonderful brunch place less than 2 blocks away to fresh daily croissant to bars to restaurants to metro.. I can go on.
When we arrived, Martin had left us personal notes about the place, with his phone number, map of the city, trash day during the week an other uselful information. We were able to find parking on the street without using parking permits but he had left us parking permits in case we needed them at a very affordable fee. The place was spotless and I felt is bigger than the pictures show. Lots of storage for your clothes as the closets are empty and ready to use. I will come back to this place next time I come back to Montreal for sure. Martin is very friendly and available and his place is wonderful. Some mentioned the toilet is a separate room than shower and sink, its true but didnt bother me. I didnt use the bbq but its a brand new big one, better than the one shown on the pictures.
Martin's place is the best place to live the local life while staying in a stress free very quiet place next to absolutely everything. If you're into road noise, construction driving you crazy and high rises, go downtown. If you want true Montreal experience, stay at the zenhouse.

Thanks Martin for the wonderful hospitality and great stay!","10"
"My family loved the apartment and the location. It is steps away from everything we needed yet quiet enough to relax and unwind. Martin is a great host and responded to all of our messages in a timely manner. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay Martin.","10"

Communication with Martin was easy and quick. Overall a fantastic experience :)","10"
"Martins place was perfect for our 4 day stay. The location is superb, we were able to walk out the front door and find great restaurants,  cocktail bars and cafes within a 5 min walk. We found we walked everywhere from his place, even to Old Port.
The beds were both so comfortable that we fell asleep straight away. The townhouse was clean and beautiful. There is even a private terrace with a BBQ which would be lovely in the summer.
The kitchen was well equipped for any type of cooking, that is if you can stop yourself from eating out.
I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend his place.","10"
"Fantastic place!  The location is great, it was clean and worked perfect for what we were looking for.  Would definitely recommend!","10"
"Great location, great place, great host. Would definitely stay again.","10"
"My wife and I decided to stay at Martin’s for our third trip back to Montreal. Very well located. Pretty close to main streets, shopping, and cafés. Very spacious for the price. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to someone looking for a spacious, affordable and stylish Airbnb near fun attractions in Montreal.","10"

"Nous avons passé mon copain et moi une semaine idyllique dans l'appartement de Martin.  L'emplacement de l'appartement est idéal, dans le quartier du plateau où nous pouvons tout trouver à proximité, jeune et dynamique avec la station de métro à 500m, à 2 stations de Berry UQAM ( la principale station de métro). 
L'appartement est décoré avec goût, lumineux, propre et j'en passe.. On se sent comme à la maison ( parfois un peu trop au point de ne plus avoir envie de bouger ). 
Nous n'avons malheureusement pas eu le plaisir de voir Martin mais celui ci a toujours été très réactif dès que j'avais une question, c'etait parfait. Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés. 
Bon voyage à tous.","10"
"Absolument rien à redire!! Appartement spacieux, propre, décoré avec goût, cosy et magnifiquement bien placé.","10"

"Bien et pratique","9"
"The room was great, really big and very clean! The location was really good. Walking distance to the metro, downtown, Parc mont royal and lots of cafes, restaurants, bars etc. The bathroom and kitchen were not so good but do have everything you need. Would not recommend if you like to stay in and cook but you don't need to because there are loads of great restaurants only a short walk away. Otherwise would recommend because the location is great.","9"
"Awesome! Good location","9"

"Está ubicado en una zona céntrica, accesible al transporte público, cerca de muchos lugares turísticos :) súper tranquilo, tienes tu propio espacio.","9"
"Der Vermieter ist freundlich und die Wohnung liegt mit der Nähe zur McGill Universität gut, der Blick aus dem Fenster ist schön. Das Zimmer welches ich hatte ist großzügig, quadratisch, hell und das Bett bequem. Im Grunde passt die Beschreibung und das Foto. Das Hauptproblem ist die miserable Hygiene!!! Überall in der Wohnung, beginnend mit dem Eingang, ist es schmutzig, unaufgeräumt, zerrissene Kisten stehen herum, Lebensmittelreste in der Küche überall, im Bad keinerlei Sauberkeit, schmutzige Wäsche, benutzte Unterhosen am Boden, mein Zimmer war schmuddelig und ich wurde das Gefühl nicht los, das meine Bettwäsche und die Handtücher nicht frisch gewaschen waren ja sogar, das es möglicherweise Ungeziefer wie Wanzen oder Milben im Bett gab, was allerdings schwer beweisbar ist. Montréal ist wunderschön aber diese Unterkunft besuche ich nicht mehr!!!","9"
"Une chambre qui correspond totalement à la description et un matelas correct. 

Par contre une salle de bain qui n’a pas été nettoyée depuis 6mois, un caleçon qui traîne par terre pendant 2 jours et un amoncellement de poubelles sur le balcon sont étonnants !

Les tarifs bas nous ont fait venir et nous ne le regrettons pas mais il ne faut pas s’attendre à trop...","9"
"Great place! It’s just as described - my room was big and comfortable, I could control my own heat which was great, and the location is excellent. The hosts were communicative even if I didn’t see them, sending emails checking to see how things were and to give me info on the house, and even a credit for a local electric car taxi company! You won’t have access to a common space and remember that you have to share the bathroom with a few people, but with those in mind this is a great stay and I recommend it!","9"
"Beautiful room in one of the most charming neighborhoods in Montreal! Many places near or reachable by waking, bus or metro. 
Shampoo, soap and towels included :)  
I would stay here again for sure!","9"
"Nice and welcoming host. The room is pretty large and cozy. However it’s necessary to take public transport to go to the main tourist points.","9"

"He was a good host. He welcomed us at the gate because we couldnt open the door. The room was quite big but a little cold. It would have been nicer if we could see the photos of other areas as well. Overall it was good though. Thanks again!","9"

Would recommend","9"
"I had a great stay! The place is very easy to find and super close, walking distance, to everything in the city. My room felt very cozy. The natural light from the big window was great and the heating worked very well. Communication with Shakil was excellent and he promptly helped with all the concerns I had. Would recommend!! :)","9"

"McGill Ghetto is an excellent place to be in Montréal. Communication was very easy and the room has completely satisfied all my expectations. Also the neighborhood is pretty nice, not far from a park and /or other spots where I have eaten delicious food.
I definitely recommend this place to other guests. 
Grazie tante! Andrea","9"
"I really enjoyed my stay here. A nice big comfortable room in a really cool neighbourhood in Montreal - Love it! The host was great - very friendly and helpful. A great value and highly recommended!","9"
"Good place for single male university age student travelers. Very close to everything and the university.","9"
"Simple hostel style accommodation, nice guys in charge who gave great travel tips that were much appreciated. Some noise from other guests and hosts so it's not totally peaceful but as long as you're using it as a base to explore the city and not as a home for any period of time it will suit your needs perfectly.","9"
"The room is clean, big and tidy. The house is in a great location, very quiet and walking distance to old town and Mount Royal. The host is very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this place to stay and enjoy the nice city, Montreal.","9"
"We only stayed for one night, so we couldn't meet the hosts or experience the ""vibe"" of the place. 

The room is as depicted in the photos. Clean and spacious. However, it is worth keeping in mind that the other areas of the house, namely, bathroom and kitchen are shared with many other people. Thus, it is hard to keep them clean. 

They have a cat, which we were not aware of, but he is really nice and friendly. 

The location was very good, it provides free-parking right in front of the place, which made it easier for us.","9"
"Logement reellement prevu pour jeunes occupants .  tres bien situe au Centre .  bonne ambiance","9"
"Wonderful hosts at a great location! The place is situated between downtown and mcgill within walking distance of various beautiful quirky places in Montreal that the hosts will be more than happy to recommend! Would stay here again in the future. Hosts were kind and fun to hang out with (I even got to try their cooking)!","9"
"We loved the great location, the friendly hosts, the easy communication!  We would definitely stay there again!","9"

"My room was extremely spacious and clean. Thank you!","9"
"This space was right amongst downtown Montreal and was amazing value for money! Nice big bright room with a comfy bed. Great for a trip where you need to get some work done too.

Everyone was friendly and gave me tips on the area. Will pass back through.","9"
"Great location","9"
"Great spot for downtown Montreal, good for one night. Other guests in the house. Not a bad thing but I didn’t know there were othere guests in the house until I was there. But was a great time.","9"
"Great location and clean space! Amazing value","9"
"Très correct, rapport qualité prix acceptable et très disponible.","9"
"Great location. Quick walk to Contemporary Art Museum, Convention Center, Eva B's, tons of restaurants and bars around the corner. Bargain for the price. Roommates are very friendly and social. Can get a little loud on the weekends but housemates are very courteous if asked to keep quiet.","9"
"Great place for the price. Location is prefect for downtown. The check-in process is simple and straight forward.","9"
"Not very responsive and not attuned to guest needs","9"
"This room is exactly like the picture. The guys living in the house were friendly. Location is awesome, 15-20 minutes walk to restaurants, bars and nightclubs.","9"
"The place was fine and is as advertised.  You get what you pay for, at the low price the room is nice. The bathrooms were fine, shower handle fell off so it was difficult to work and it wasn’t working one morning. The cat is cute. 

Hosts were nice but loud late at night when I was trying to sleep, and the kitchen was full of dirty dishes all the time. Would not stay here again.","9"
"Great value for money and a perfect crashpad after a long day's work. Lots of cafes and bars nearby and downtown is only a short walk away. The hosts were friendly and their cat Frank was a gem!","9"
"Great location and smooth checkin and checkout. Would recommend since the space was large for two people. 
All nights there had lots of talking outside so it was hard to sleep but otherwise everyone is super nice. ","9"
"저렴한 가격으로 괜찮은 방에서 하룻밤 자기 좋습니다. 호스트분들도 친절하고 몽로얄까지 걸어갈 수 있는 위치에 있어요. 다만 밤늦게까지 호스트분들이 떠들어서 조금 힘들었네요. 그점빼고 괜찮습니다. 

It is good place to spend one night for cheaper price. The room is beautiful and is not far from university, mont royal and downtown. Hosts are also sooo kind but they talked until the night when i was trying to sleep . Except this one, i recommend this house to you.","9"

"Airbnb très pratique pour un séjour à Montréal agréable.","9"
"They let me drop off my luggage early. They were very nice and helpful. 
Location was very convenient. ","9"
"Accurate description of the room we rented. The rented room is fairly clean. The shared bathroom is dirty. Bathtub gets pretty slippery probably due to lack of a good cleaning. The shower nob is broken and fell each time when I took shower. location is good. parking is good. oh! one of 4 nights we stayed got pretty loud around mid-night and lasted couple of hours. My partner did get out of bed and walked to the kitchen just so they knew we were already in. Unfortunately, the noise level went down for a bit and then back up again.","9"
"Excellent communication and beautiful room in a nice area.","9"
"disappointed","9"
"These guys are very nice and friendly hosts and they have a very cute cat to welcome you.
The location is the biggest plus as it is just 5-10 mins walk to Eaton centre and other places in downtown.
Few things that were mentioned by previous guests and were not fixed by the host are:
The kitchen sink had unwashed dishes from days as it looked not too good to stand in kitchen with a sink full of dirty dishes.
The shower nozle even dislocates and comes in hand.
I would give 10 stars for the location if I could. 
Beware of the street parking signs guys as I got a $62 parking ticket for parking at the exact same spot the host asked me to park (the free parking spot) in front of the house. ","9"
"The room was clean and spacious, the washroom is so dirty, I love cats but I didn't like see in front of my room a container with popo.","9"
"It has a very good location. The cleaning of hallways can be improved.","9"
"The host was very nice, friendly and helpful. It was an pretty good location. An ok stay but would have been better if common areas were better kept.","9"
"Sweet place to be in","9"
"I am trying to be honest here! I checked in late night and the access to place was good, the AC was broken and not working at all as written in the description, they have a cat, the kitchen and bathroom was horrible everywhere with ladies hair. 
There are too many people living in this place I couldn’t have a chance to take a shower at all till 11:00AM the check-out time so I left the place with not taking shower.  ","9"
"El lugar tiene buena ubicacion, las habitaciones son muy espaciosas y el ambiente es juvenil y  agradable. Me parece un gran acierto la forma tan detallada en cómo te dan la
 informacion de todo lo que puedes llegar a necesitar antes y durante tu estancia, que uno no necesita pedir que lo reciban personalmente!!Ademas de que se ponen a disposicion de los huespedes diariamente a traves de este medio como muestra de hospitalidad. Lo recomiendo totalmente!!

However, host is very pleasant and nice, and the place itself is great! ","9"

"El alojamiento es tal como en el anuncio, es limpio y ordenado, los únicos detalles fueron que había un poco de ruido exterior pero se entiende porque la zona es como de estudiantes y el otro detalle fue que la llave de la regadera está floja y se zafa y casi me cae en el pie, solo tengan cuidado con eso.","9"

"Best location in Montreal! Loved the style of the room!","9"
"The place is inexpensive and at a very good location for me. Very easy access to metro. Most places including downtown, mont royal, and old Montreal are within walking distance. However, the place wasn't as clean as I expected. For students, it is a good place to stay I guess.","9"

"Nice, cheap place to stay close to downtown. Quiet and clean. There's a cat which you can smell. I don't mind but if you're allergic or sensitive to cat smell you might not enjoy. Thee fridge was a little gross as well. Host was nice. For a short stay not a bad spot ESP for the price.","9"
"i had to cancel last minute and they were very honorable and attentive , checking in on me and respecting the cancellation policy :) two thumbs up!","9"
"Just perfect ! 10/10 enough said !","9"
"The location of this bnb was really great, it’s really close to downtown. 

However, we had a strange time checking in, with another guest in our assigned room. In that confusion, we ended up in a different room which hadn’t been cleaned. There was garbage and dirty glasses. The walls in the house are also extremely thin, we were woken up every morning by people talking loudly out front our door and even a loud barking dog on the first night (though there was no mention that animals would be there apart from the cat - who is very cute and friendly).

The shower also wasn’t working, the handle had been broken off so we weren’t able to shower (but we didn’t have clean towels anyways). The front door also didn’t lock.

Overall, it was a mixed bag. Location was good but we didn’t really enjoy our stay.","9"
"Très correct pour le prix ! 
Chambre très grande et confortable.
Très flexible et arrangeant.","9"
"It an incredible place to stay, I enjoy my time there a great hospitality","9"
"Really nice place with a spacious room and easy check in option when the host isn’t there. I went for a job interview which lasted all day so I only used the apartment to sleep for two nights. Although there was hair on the toilet and in the shower the place was clean-ish, the bed was very comfortable and room very well decorated. The only complaint I have is that both nights I fell asleep early, like around 10pm and on both nights I was woken up by loud voices (mainly female) around midnight and then realized there was also a dog running around. When it happened the second night I went out to ask the hosts to please be quiet and they immediately were quiet. If I didn’t have to get up early I wouldn’t really care, but both mornings I had to wake up super early so it was a bit of a shame to have a broken sleep. Otherwise I would recommend this place to stay if they improve what I’ve suggested.","9"

"Appartement propre et très bien situé . Bon séjour","9"
"Nice and clean place close to town. Our main issue was that we did not get any keys for our room which felt quite unsafe since there are 4 other rooms in the apartment where unknown people lived. It was unpleasant to not be able to lock the door while sleeping or being out of the house. Also we asked for the keys both via text and by calling the emergency number. We got the information that there was no keys for the room we were staying in. After checking out thogh the host contacted me to ask where I put the keys. This is not a major problem but it is very unprofessional to not provide keys for the guests and later proceed to ask them for the non-exciting keys.","9"
"The flat was lovely and very open.  We were there during the hottest days of the year, and Carole had some fans set up - combined with the big windows throughout the apartment, it was perfect.  There is a very cute porch outside with a cafe table and chairs - ideal for coffee in the morning.  It's a pleasant 30 minute walk to the mountain/park in the center of the city, and just 10 minutes from several really great restaurants.","10"
"Lovely place, great location, extremely kind host. I would recommend this place without hesitation. ","10"
"Accueil très chaleureux, une très belle rencontre! On peut échanger à la fois sur l'art et le milieu environnant, une joie.

"Carole a été très réactive à ma demande. J'avais besoin d'un logement rapidement et elle a répondu quelques minutes plus tard. 
L'appartement, idéalement situé, est très confortable, propre et moderne. Il y a tout ce qu'il faut à proximité pour passer un agréable séjour : restaurants, magasins, bars. Pour ceux qui visitent le Canada en voiture, comme c'était notre cas, il y a un loueur de voiture juste à côté de l'appartement, ce qui nous a permis de rendre la voiture avant de séjourner à Montréal. 
N'hésitez pas à contacter pour un séjour idéal à Montréal !","10"

"Great stay in a clean, nice hip apartment in the plateau. Carole was a great host. There were many restaurants, coffee shops and supermarkets right around, as well as the park. I definitely recommend that place. ","10"
"We had a great stay at Carole's place.  It is walkable to cafes, restaurants, and shopping in the Plateau neighborhood.

She was very accommodating and the apartment was clean, hip, and a good value. It's a walk up with several stairs, so be aware if you have mobility issues.","10"

Nous etions 2 adultes et 2 enfants (7 et 11ans), c est parfait.","10"
"The apartment is in a great location - it's close to shops and restaurants. and there's also a grocery store nearby. The community felt very safe, even at night. It was very easy to get around - we either walked or rode the bixi bikes everywhere. The apartment was clean, check-in was efficient and Carole was very friendly. We had everything we needed and would definitely stay there again. We enjoyed sipping our morning coffee and people watching from the balcony:-)","10"
"Loved our stay. The place was clean and very convenient. Would definitely stay again!","10"
"Le condo de Carole est très bien situé sur le plateau de Mont-Royal. Il est grand, sa décoration street art/ indus nous a bcp plu. 2 ""dépanneurs"" à proximité sont très utiles. Et pour les plus grosses courses, il faut plutôt marcher 500 mètres, avenue Mont Royal. Vous y trouverez tout ! 
Carole a été aux petits soins. ","10"

"Loved our stay here! It was very clean and the beds were all comfortable to sleep in. The balcony was our fav spot to hang out while we were at “home”. Carole was so helpful on a couple occasions when we needed her to be there to accept our lost luggage that was delivered. We didn’t really see her but she was there to help us any time we asked. Such a great space! We will definitely stay again. Bixi bikes are right outside the door and the metro is a short walk away.","10"
"Un accueil au top, Carole est très sympathique et arrangeante, son guide de son bonnes’ adresses est très pratique. Le logement est pratique et très joliment décoré, nous nous y sentions comme chez nous ! Il paraît également plus grand en réalité que sur les photos. Le logement est bien situé et nous avons pu nous rendre où nous le souhaitions grâce au bus et au métro. Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour et nous y reviendrions avec grand plaisir ! ","10"
"Superbe appartement bien placé, une super deco, un super balcon. Le quartier est calme et proche de tout en même temps. Nos hôtes étaient réactifs et super sympathiques. Le seul point négatif : la wifi que nous avions énormément de mal à capter, et une fois fait le débit était lent. Je recommande ","10"
"Un vrai moment de bonheur,
L'appartement est en tous points conforme à la description. Joliment aménagé, très clair et très fonctionnel. Confortable et très bien équipé, (et décoré !), il vous donne l'impression d'être un vrai Montréalais ! La météo nous a permis de prendre les déjeuners sur la terrasse, en compagnie des écureuils. Carole et son compagnon sont des hôtes absolument charmants, disponibles et attentifs à votre bien-être. Un must sur le plateau Mont Royal !","10"

"This is not a 3 bed condo. It’s false advertisement.  The owner added a flimsy cheap small blowup mattress (that might be ok for a toddler) which doesn’t count as a bed. If it did, I guess he could leave 5 more of these mattresses in his closet and call it a 7 bed rental! The owner refused to help us. He stoped responding to my calls and ignored my msgs.  

I would only recommend renting this if you are 4 people max.","9"
"Johnny’s place was AMAZING. The pictures do not even do it justice! My friends and I stayed here for one night and wished we could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back again! Minutes from night life at St. Catherine Street and Crescent Street. Absolutely perfect.","9"

"Not awful, but you can find MUCH nicer places in Montréal for the same price. I found the place to be super noisy and it smelled like mothballs. Also, someone threw a brick through one of the windows in the middle of the night, so I woke up at 3 am to the sound of breaking glass and people yelling... I'm assuming this doesn't happen every night, but it might not be the safest neighborhood.","9"
"Dion ist such a great host - flexible, kind and always happy to help! Thanks for your hospitality and  for making our stay memorable! We will definitely come back.

"This place offers everything it says. It is more like a hostel where you rent your private bedroom and many people share the common areas such as kitchen and bathrooms. Subway is about 10 minute walk, but it can be brutal during the winter.","9"

"I spent 9 days in Dion's house. It was great! The rooms are just alike how they appear in the picture. Amenities were fully-supplied. Bathrooms were clean. You might have to walk a bit if travelling by Métro though.","9"
"It's more of a guesthouse/hostel. Not a proper home. 

Pros: Very affordable, good value, bedroom and common areas were clean, quiet and bed was very comfy. Also the host is prompt to answer. 

Cons: Bedroom is quite bright during the night (curtains not thick enough to block street lights and door is made of glass). Men's washroom was quite dirty. I used the women's one which was clean. They are individual washrooms so I didn't understand why splitting sex.","9"

"El departamento de Isabelle esta en una de las mejores zonas de Montreal, cerca de muchos restaurantes, bares y lugares icónicos como el Mont Royal. 
Isabelle es una excelente anfitriona, te dará muchas recomendaciones de lugares a visitar y lugares para comer para todos los gustos. El departamento esta muy limpio y lleno de estilo. Sin duda alguna, si regresara a Montreal, me volvería a quedar aquí.","10"
"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Isabelle et Jo ! Ils ont étaient très accueillants et disponibles, leur appartement est idéalement situé, je le recommande :)","10"
"My stay at Isabelle and Jonathan's apartment was fantastic — incredibly clean and comfortable, quiet (despite being right off of a main thoroughfare), and central to anything you'd need on the Plateau. Great communication, easy check-in and -out, and lovely people who gave many food/drink/activity recommendations and went out of their way to meet my needs. Highly recommend!","10"
"Isabelle y Jonathan fueron increibles anfitriones. Además de tener una casa con una excelente ubicacion, cerca de restaurants y bares, y  a 5 minutos caminando hasta la estacion de subte mas cercana. La casa es hermosa, muy comoda y hasta pudimos estacionar nuestro auto alquilado en la puerta de la casa, sin pagar un centavo. Ellos no estaban al momento de la llegada pero pudimos coordinar facilmente entrar a la casa.","10"
"Je suis venue pour un we prolongé. L’appartement est idéal, en plein centre du Plateau, calme, tout est fait pour se sentir bien et l’accueil d’Isabelle et son ami est top! Merci à vous 2. Je recommande vivement et je reviendrai!","10"
"Isabelle and John are great! The house is very clean, the room is nicely decorated and the bed is really comfortable. We are very happy that we chose this place. They welcomed us with certain recommendations to visit as well as good tips for restaurants in the area. We would definitely repeat our stay if we would come back to Montreal!","10"
"A beautiful, clean, and private space in the heart of the Plateau.","10"
"My partner and I had an excellent stay at Isabelle's apartment. The location is wonderful and the place was very clean and comfortable. There were lots of nice little touches throughout as well. One of the best experiences we've had on Airbnb!","10"
"L'appartement était vraiment agréable, particulièrement propre et bien situé (restaurants, bars et métro à proximité). La réception des clefs s'est fait grâce à une key box ce qui a facilité notre arrivée (idem pour le départ). Nous avons passé un très bon séjour et recommandons vivement ce Airbnb (lit confortable, chambre spacieuse, thé à disposition). Isabelle vend également du sirop d'érable (fait maison) à moindre coût. Jonathan et elle sont discrets et très sympa. Ils partagent d'ailleurs leurs meilleures adresses dans un petit livret rédigé à l'attention de leurs hôtes.","10"
"Super hôte et super endroit paisible pour s arrêter quelques jours et découvrir Montréal. Isabelle donne des bons plans et c'est très agréable d échanger avec elle sur le Canada. Super bon plan concernant le sirop d érable de son papa :) . On recommande les yeux fermés.","10"

"Très bel appartement idéalement situé ! 
Isabelle et Jonathan sont adorables et nous ont offert un accueil unique !
Chambre bien décoré et très confortable :-) nous recommandons cette chambre !","10"
"The location of the this apartment cannot be beat. It is in one the prettiest/coolest neighborhoods with tons of shopping and restaurants a short walk away. Isabelle and Jonathan were very kind and provided maps and helpful tips for where to go. They were also very responsive when I called with questions. The only thing I would caution is that they wake up early, so you want to be quiet at night (but it's ok to stay out late). I would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Extremely clean and tidy place with warmth of thoughtful touch in every corner. The hosts are very helpful with any need of ours with their welcoming packet. 
The property itself has one of the quietest room I've ever slept in. However there are several fantastic music venues/nightclubs, cafes and restaurants within 5-minue walk. 
Highly highly recommend!","10"

"Very cosy room, well located and the owners are really friendly! 
I can't find anything wrong with this Airbnb. Wifi is good, they have a nice shower, the bed is cosy, there wasn't any noise at night... Those are the things that were important to us.","10"

Oh, and Isabelle is a gracious host. Highly recommend.","10"
"Isabelle et Jonathan sont très sympathiques ! Ils nous ont fourni des adresses utiles pour visiter Montréal. Le logement est très bien situé. La chambre est nickel et décorée avec goût ! On recommande sans hésiter ;)","10"
"Isabelle and Jonathan's place is located in the beautiful French neighbourhood of Montreal and was the perfect spot to spend a few nights. They gave me a list of great local cafes, bakeries and bars to check out, as well as where to get classic poutine and smoked meat. Their home is very stylish and clean – I would definitely stay again!","10"
"it doesn't get better.","10"
"Our stay was great - location is perfect and the place is super clean and organized. 
100% recommended! ","10"
"Isabelle's place offered the perfect accommodation while I did my business in the city. The plateau location is the perfect combination of a lively, fun neighbourhood during the daytime, and a quiet place to lay your head at night. Both Jonathan and Isabelle were extremely welcoming hosts, and everything exceeded my expectations. ","10"
"Hemos estado muy agusto en el alojamiento de Isabelle y Jo, la casa es muy confortable y acogedora, han cuidado todos los detalles, limpieza genial, estuvieron muy atentos y nos dieron algunas indicaciones para movernos por alli. Lo recomendamos 100%","10"

"Perfect for a couple visiting family in Outremont.","10"
"My husband and I stayed a total of 16 nights in Andrée’s 4-room cozy and well-furnished apartment. We literally had a home away from home — breakfast on the balcony, cooking our own dinners and even having guests, helping ourselves to Andrée’s amazing collection of spices, getting to know the staff at nearby Young’s grocery, curling up in front of the tv, sleeping in late in the quiet, comfortable bedroom, and even trick-or-treating on Halloween since this is a residential neighborhood. Andrée’s den/office was so practical that my husband actually worked too much most days, but then I could get out and shop and visit Outremont‘s many beautiful parks with our daughter and new baby grandson. We pushed the stroller up to the top of Mont Royal a couple times too. I loved the proximity of Mile End and Plateau. We walked there easily (coming back by Uber). To go downtown we used the metro, a 10-minute walk away. Now whenever we visit our daughter who lives in Outremont, we’ll hope Andrée’s very affordable place is available!","10"
"Appartement de style, entièrement équipé pour un long sejour, bien situé dans le quartier Outremont, arrêts de bus à 5mn, métro à 10/15 mn. Je remercie encore Andrée pour son accueil et sa disponibilité. Je recommande.","10"
"Andrée est une personne très accueillante, hospitalière et accommodante. Mon épouse et moi avons passé 4 jours dans son appartement et avons eu du plaisir. L'appartement est propre, ensoleillé et bien équipé. Endroit que je recommande à tous. Vous ne serez pas déçu!","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 67 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"I had the pleasure of staying at Andrée’s place for a week and I highly recommend it. Andrée was such an excellent, attentive host. Once I arrived, she took the time to show her house and to provide tips on places and events. The kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, and dishes so I had everything I needed to cook my meals. She also made sure everything was fine during my stay. I needed an iron board and iron for a business meeting and she gladly made them available. I really enjoyed staying in a traditional French residential neighborhood with several options of groceries, restaurants, and shops. The apartment is well located, close to the blue line station Outremont that takes you downtown in thirty minutes. It is also relatively easy to come from/go to the airport (about $30 uber trip). The apartment has paid laundry (four loonies) in the building basement so it was a perk not to leave the building. Unfortunately, I came during the winter so the days were cloudy, snowy, and gray so I didn’t have the chance to see the greenery Montréal is famous for. The city wasn’t quiet, though. Montréal en Lumière was taking place on Avenue Sainte Catherine during the weekend so I was able to check a famous city festival. I’ll definitely be back in the summer.","10"
"Andrée est une hôte merveilleuse et l'appartement est spacieux, propre, sympathique et très pratique. Nous y avons passé 6 jours. Métro et commerces à proximité.  Je recommande cet appartement sans réserve! Au plaisir d'y retourner :)","10"
"This is a great place to stay, very nice, clean, and a pretty close drive to major places like the gay village and Museum of Fine Arts. Andrée was very nice to us and very accommodating.","10"
"Lieu très bien situé pour découvrir Montréal. Appartement très ensoleillé et très agréable.","10"

","10"
"Appartement très bien situé, près du Métro et du Mont-Royal. Andrée est très accomodante et est une hôte parfaite. Tout était comme prévu et on n'a pas eu de mauvaises surprises. Beau travail","10"
"I had a great stay at Andree's place.  The flat is spacious, and well layed out.  I had a presentation to write and I found that the balcony surrounded by pine tree branches was a perfect place for that (though Andree also has a nice office).  The neighbourhood is great:  quiet tree lined streets with brownstone houses (some villas around Outremont park are particularly beautiful), and excellent cafes and restaurants within walking distance.  Metro is just under 10 minutes walk, and so is Dax cafe for a morning espresso with pastry.  I went to a conference at the HEC Montreal, and it was 20 minutes door to door.  Andree herself is lovely and welcoming.  I've been to quite a lot of AirBnBs, and this is one of the best.","10"
"Très beau quartier, à proximité d'une station de métro et de la très jolie rue Bernard. Deux belles terrasses, idéales pour la détente en fin de journée. Excellente communication avant et durant le séjour. Merci Andrée !","10"
"Accueil sympathique et convivial par Andrée. Son appartement est spacieux,  lumineux et très bien équipé avec une  agréable terrasse qui permet de prendre son petit-déjeuner et les repas en toute tranquillité. Les petites épiceries sont accessibles à pied et les transports en commun sont également très proches.
L'appartement d'Andrée est incontestablement une excellente adresse pour un séjour à Montréal. Encore merci Andrée pour votre accueil chaleureux.","10"
"Lovely place with everything you need and a charming balcony. Andree let us in and took her time to explain where. everything was. Highly recommended.","10"
"Très bon séjour chez Andrée. Très chaleureuse et sympathique. Je vous recommande son appartement !","10"
"The worst part of experience while visiting Montréal after an over 7-hour drive from the states. The host kept complaining for arriving late and was even not happy about our early leave. I asked her about late arrival before booking and she still invited me to book this place. After the late arrival happened, I apologized and explained to her a lot of times, but she just kept complaining to us, and was even blaming us for early leave... said this ruined her weekend plans... I mean if you have plans for the weekend why inviting us to book your room? Why even put on the availabilities on Airbnb? We were not staying at your place for free, we paid to stay but we did not feel welcomed at all. Felt like we did something wrong just by staying at her place.. Also, be aware of flying spider. 2 stars for the cozy bed","10"
"Vous vous plairez  lors de votre séjour chez Andrée. L’accueil, la propreté des lieux, les attentions de l’hôte sont autant de facteurs qui sauront vous mettre à l’aise.","10"
"Andrée was an incredible hostess. She showed me around her home personally and made sure to explain where everything was. 
The unit is in great shape, but the building is fairly old. The water pressure wasn’t the best in the washroom and the unit isn’t exactly in the downtown area. 
Those are the only things about the unit that weren’t great, because everything else was perfect! It’s a very rustic place that’s very well kept. I felt very comfortable there, and there was a sweet homey feel to it. I’d definitely recommend staying there if you’re willing to walk or commute to the downtown area. 
Otherwise, the area itself has many great things to offer!
Andrée is also a great hostess. She replied back to any questions I had almost instantly.","10"
"super accueil, super équipement, super équipement, super emplacement, super Andrée quoi !
merci encore !","10"

"What a great place!  Perfect for a large group or family. Very stylish and well laid out and Naomi and Rene are phenomenal and thoughtful hosts.  Highly recommend it!","10"
"This exquisite 5 stars three floors condo apartment was ideally located nearby the national tennis centre (Uniprix Stadium) where our tennis team lodge for 4 days during their tennis camp. This condo unit is ideal for large families or sports teams or to those wanting to have spacious living space. Thank you Rene for your warm hospitality.","10"
"Thanks to René and Naima, I rented their place for a small photoshoot and everything was awesome, clean and well representative of the picture.

I would definitively recommend that house for a weekend, long stay or small commercial production.","10"
"This space is absolutely great for a friends getaway! Rene's place is beautifully decorated, spacious and very clean. They were extremely accommodating when three of our friends had a late flight. They let them stay on past check out till they had to leave for their flight which was really nice! I would highly recommend this place!","10"
"Rene met me there upon arrival. He was very detailed yet brief in his tour of the place. He suggested a couple restaurants in the area and gave me great tips on ski mountains as well. Naomi was extremely helpful throughout the duration of the trip too. She got back to me instantly any time I reached out to her. The place was absolutely perfect for our bachelor party extravaganza in Montreal. It was even nicer than the pictures. I would recommend this place 100 times over!","10"

"This place is awesome.  We stayed here with a large group and there was plenty of room for all of us.  The place was super clean and very comfortable.  Also, a 2 minute walk to the metro.  Bike sharing station across the street from the apartment.  Would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Rene's townhome is perfect for large groups. It is spacious, clean, and well appointed with great comforting touches in a modern and functional space.

Perfect accommodations and always timely responses... it doesn’t get any better! :)","10"

"Love the place!!! The host were absolutely unbelievable and very responsive. We are coming back!","10"
"R & N were such gracious hosts! Their home was modern, stylish, and very cozy. We made great use of the outdoor patio area on the third floor. Very spacious and great for large groups - we slept 12 without a problem. Thanks again to you both for a weekend we will never forget!","10"
"Rene's place was perfect for our group of 6.  Plenty of places to sleep, really clean and spacious apartment, and located in a nice neighborhood with a short walk to the metro. Highly recommended!","10"
"René and Naima are wonderful hosts! René met us at check in and and tour the house. We felt so comfortable and relaxed here. I asked René about things to do in Montreal and he asked Naima to email a list. So helpful! The neighborhood is so welcoming . We went to 5 restaurants in walking distance and the staff were helpful and warm to these non-French speaking visitors! We enjoyed our stay so much , we hope to return soon to explore more of Montreal and this awesome neighborhood! On Our trip to Canada this was the best place we stayed! Merci! ","10"
"Very nice house in very good location--as long as you don;t mind riding the metro...which by the way is extremely efficient, safe, and clean. We liked being in a real neighborhood. Stores and restaurants nearby had everything we needed. Naima and Rene were very responsive hosts.","10"

"We had a wonderful 3 nights stay in this stylish townhouse. Communication with the hosts before and during our stay was perfect and prompt! We ran late due to traffic and they patiently waited for us and were very nice and welcoming! The house was perfectly clean and beautifully decorated. Very large for being in the city! Awesome modern bathrooms. The location is perfect - near the subway station and lots of fun spots! The rooftop patio is awesome and they have a babyfoot table, TVs and offered some great suggestions of things to check out! Lots of towels, comfy beds and couch, the home is literally perfect! The kitchen is really well furnished! Keypad to the front door is super convenient - no risk of losing keys! We had a wonderful time and most likely will be back on a future visit to Montreal!","10"

Plenty of room for all our family , magnificent kitchen ( with Nespresso coffee machine)and bathrooms and lots of room for relaxation.

There were more than enough towels and beds for every girl. René and Naima were also very sweet and made check in super easy especially since we arrived after midnight. They recommended a few places for us to check out and responded quickly to our questions. They even let us know that they had found one of our girls keys and made the time to send it back. This place deserves more than 5 stars and I would highly recommend! Thank you René and Naima!","10"
"L’appartement est parfaitement situé dans un quartier très vivant et a proximité du métro ce qui permet de rejoindre très rapidement le centre. La deco est tres sympa et l’équipement est parfait ! Rene et Naima sont des hôtes très prévenants qui font tout pour que le séjour se passe bien. Nous avons passé en famille une super semaine et nous reviendrons chez eux avec grand plaisir lors de notre prochain séjour à Montréal . Je ne peux que recommander ce lieu pour visiter cette ville.","10"
"This home is super comfortable for a large group and we were beyond comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked with coffee, pots, pans, a toaster, blender, etc. The house is a 5 minute walk from the Metro which is also perfect. Parking is a bit tricky, but even with street construction we made it work for our 3 vehicles. Beds are super comfy too!!","10"
"The host went above and beyond. This home was recently updated and you will notice the small details. The bathrooms had heated floors!!! Rene made great recommendations around the neighborhood and further. She provided us with a map with highlights. Definitely worth the stay and will be back.","10"
"You will love this home, it is spacious, clean, and the hosts are wonderful!","10"

"Every recommendation!","10"
"Nous avons très bien été accueilli par notre hôte dès notre arrivée et il s'est assuré que tout se passait bien tout au long de notre séjour. Il est facile de communiquer avec lui et il est très disponible.  

Le condo est situé dans un quartier tranquille à proximité du Métro Jarry, donc facile de se déplacer dans Montréal. Les photos de l'annonce représentent très bien le logement qui est fraîchement rénové et au goût du jour. Moderne, très bien équipé et extrêmement propre, je retournerais avec plaisir chez René lors de mon prochain séjour dans la métropole. 

*Prendre note qu'il y a 8 places pour dormir dans les lits, donc si vous êtes plus que 8 voyageurs, vous devrez utiliser les divans lits.","10"
"The place was great !!! The host on the other hand HORRIBLE. 
This guys i currently trying to scam 1000+ dollars for damages we did not do after kicking us out.","10"
"This Airbnb was great. Thanks to the  Naima who I dealt with primarily. Everything went smoothly and their place is amazing really modern and is as good as it looks in the pictures. Their is also a great breakfast place just around the corner only a 3 minute walk that Naima recommended. It’s definitely worth trying!

The only thing we had a small issue with was finding parking but I believe that it was mainly because of the snow and we arrived in the evening. There is plenty of areas to park around that are free just need to get a spot. 

Overall this place was exactly what we wanted and everything was great! 

Thanks again!","10"
"Amazing place for small groups","10"
"Rene & Naima's place was perfect for our group of 4. They met us at the AirBnB upon arrival and had saved a parking spot on the street for us which was very considerate. They provided a tour of their place and gave us some helpful tips on near by restaurants, grocery stores, locations of the metro, etc. They were extremely kind and helpful throughout the entire experience. Always responding quickly to questions and even offering us a late checkout on our final day.

The space itself is amazing and I found the pictures did not do it justice. It truly felt much bigger in person and for 4 people it was plenty of space. It was exceptionally clean and had all amenities you would need. It is within walking distance (5-10 mins) from the metro station, pubs/breweries, restaurants, a small grocery store, and a amazing butchers shop. I would highly recommend booking their place if you are in the area!","10"
"The house was gorgeous, modern and clean with so many nice details. The shower heads were incredible, there was shampoo and conditioner, plenty of towels and pillows, comfortable beds and blankets. It was a great experience. We were a group of 8 and everyone was comfortable and loved the space. The hosts helped suggest things to do prior to the trip and even helped answer questions during and after the trip. They were very quick to respond. There were restaurants within walking distance and it was a reasonable Uber ride to many of the cities popular attractions. We hope to go back during the summer!","10"
"The location is perfect and her roomates too, but the room was not clean and everything was smelling smoke. If you know that you have allergy of smoke, then this place is not for you. Also I advice you not to use the balcony table to avoide surprise. Finally, you may be very carefully about the accessories in the toillet as they are very old to avoid breaking them.","6"

"Je recommande fortement très classe, bien situé et très intime et sécuritaire","10"
"Je recommande cet emplacement!","10"
"Getting this place again end of Feb. Was really happy! Super clean and loved the decor. Only issue I had was the cleaning person forgot the bigger towels in the washing machine and I was drying myself up after the shower with the smaller ones. I only found them inside the washing machine on my last day... I only stayed there 3 nights but it was still pretty disappointing. Still giving them a 5. Just be careful, if you can't find any towels to shower with, they're most likely in the washing machine.","10"
"Très très bien!","10"
"its an amazing place that is right in downtown close to all restaurants, transportation and entertainment!","10"
"This was probably one of the best airbnbs I've ever stayed at. Amazing unit, nicely styled. 100% accurate to the photos and very nice touches to the place. Would definitely stay again!","10"
"Identical to pictures! Do not be alarmed by outside of building. It is not a pretty sight, but the apartment is perfect! 
Modern and clean. Comfortable bed with a relatively well stocked kitchen. I highly recommend it","10"
"Great location, very clean.. would stay here again.","10"
"This was a clean, well maintained, stylish unit located in the heart of Montreal. Great restaurants within blocks, high end shopping around the corner, close to the Art Museum. Great value. Cozy with all the amenities to make a long or short stay comfortable. Highly recommended!","10"

"Cute place. Great, convenient location. Hosts were very communicative. Would definitely recommend.","10"
"Great place to stay. Clean, very stylish and well thought out. Comfortable and large king size bed. It was steps away ~90m from Guy-Concordia (green) subway line, which was extremely convenient. We bought a $13.50 bus-subway pass valid for entire weekend at the airport and took the 747 bus to/from the airport. We were able to go to Atwater market, Bota Bota spa, walked around beautiful Old Port, China town, downtown Montreal, le Banquise for poutine and back to the airport with this $13.50 pass. Just be careful not to lose it it’s paper. We also went to Adonis (8 min walk from the place) for extra food to go along with the microgreens we bought at the market. We will definitely be back. ","10"
"The place is downtown Montreal, and close to everything. It is as shown on the website, clean and well furnished. The information were clear and accurate.
The host is very communicative , and answered our questions while required .
we enjoyed our stay in this lovely place.
Thank you","10"

"Great value, exactly as advertised.","8"
"Notre séjour chez Carlito s'est bien passé dans l'ensemble. L'appartement est bon marché et très bien placé. Le quartier est calme. Petit bémol pour la cuisine, très peu équipée, il était donc très compliqué de se faire à manger. 
Bon séjour dans l'ensemble :)","8"
"Bel appartement dans un joli quartier. Propre","8"
"Great area in the university section of Montreal, walkable to everything.","8"
"Carl's place is in an older, unrenovated high-rise, but the apartment is tidy and spacious as the photos show, and Carl is adding improvements all the time. The bed is new and the sheets are fresh. My husband and I wanted to stay near McGill University and this was a great budget option. The metro was only a 5 minute walk away and the Plateau is a few miles walk each way. The kitchen has a toaster and electric kettle. If you want to cook hot meals, you would have to bring all the basics, like cooking oil and salt and pepper, but . 

I really liked how close the apartment was to cute coffee shops and it's right next door to an excellent little vegetarian restaurant and a small used bookshop. Check-in was super easy and flexible with my needs. Carl was always ready to help when I had any questions and his hospitality is among the best I have received from an Airbnb host. Thanks Carl!","8"
"I was so grateful to be able to book Carl's apartment on the day I arrived in Montréal, after my previous plan fell apart.  Carl responded very quickly and made it possible for me to get to the apartment with no delay.  The building is older, but the apartment itself is warm and cozy.  The bed was comfortable, and the living room very pleasant.  I did not really cook during my stay there, but I could have, as there was everything needed.  Carl provided me with breakfast essentials (tea, instant coffee, and even nutella), which was so nice.  The location is perfect, especially if you want to visit McGill university.  You can walk to so many places, the location is central. I will stay there again if the place is available when I come back to Montréal.","8"
"Great host, the location is a 7 minute walk to the groceries. Lots of bars to go to very close to the strip and anything you need.","8"
"This place is for people who need a place to sleep and be on their way. Pretty good location, complimentary parking spot was helpful.","8"
"Great host and very responsive. The apartment is in a fairly central location in Montreal near plenty of restaurants, cafes, and other shops. Quite accessible by public transport. Carl was responsive regarding any issues we had. spacious and sunny living room.  Apartment is ideal if you want to cook for yourself. Highly recommended.","8"
"Carl's place is in the residential area of McGill. It is a good location, especially given the price. The place itself is nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Our only real complaint is that the unit is quite cold and the heating didn't work properly - so it made our winter stay somewhat difficult. However overall, Carl was a great host who made check in and out very easy, and we'd recommend this place to anyone who is travelling on a budget, and won't mind that the place is a little worn in.","8"
"Great host and available for any accommodations you might need! Definitely staying again!","8"
"The location of the apartment is absolutely ideal. The apartment itself is perfect, meets exactly the needs we had for our travels. Carl is super nice and always available.","8"
"Communicates fast! Easy check in, check out. Loved the decor in the place. Very kind host. Good location.","8"
"Great location, cozy!","8"
"The location is amazing! It's close to everything and really easy to get to and from. The unit itself is charming and perfect for a weekend getaway of touring around. Carl was really helpful and accessible, responding to our messages within minutes and going above and beyond to make sure we had a good trip. We would definitely stay here again.","8"
"We really enjoyed staying at here for a week! The place is newlly renovated with great furnitures. The location is very convenient. 1 min walk to McGill campus and 5 mins walk to Av Du Parc.  I would like to visit this place again if I have a chance!","8"
"Provided wrong wifi network/password on page, eventually found on back of router and that's why chromcast wouldn't work! Everything else was great!!!!","8"
"Close to everything. Montreal was very walkable in general. Friendly host. Check-in process was also easy. Only complaint was leftover hair on linens.","8"
"We had a great stay at Carl's place.  It's a wonderful location, quiet building, plus a pool and parking.  Very clean apt.  Responses were quick and helpful.","8"
"Great location, right near metro station/McGill/downtown. Carl is a great host, very quick to respond, super informative and provides great restaurant recommendations. Would highly recommend staying here!","8"
"Carl’s place has a great location and was really nice and clean inside. Carl was quick to reply if we had any questions as well.","8"
"The place was the same in the picture, it’s hard to find a parking slot around the area, it took us 30-45 mins before we find a slot coz it’s in Downtown Montreal. There were some garbage at the porch but we don’t mind coz we’re not using it. It turned us off when the host asking us for addition 50 dollars cleaning fee coz the cleaning service told him that we left the space “really messy.” Few cups of Timmys left on the table coz the bins were too small that’s the mess that we created and it’s not worth 50 dollars to pick those up. Disappointed on our stay.","8"
"Convenient location, clean, great value, and great hosts! If you care about water pressure and temperature like I do, you will love this place. Better water pressure than my own house and so quick to get hot water!!! Carl and his co-host were very attentive and were ready to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is in a university area so it’s lively and there are many great eateries nearby. Subway and buses are very close too, but if you like walking you can walk to Old Montreal in 20 minutes while enjoying the scenic old streets and getting good coffee and sweets on your way. The wifi signal was a bit weak but the hosts were aware of it and tried to fix the issue. Overall I recommend this place to everyone!","8"
"Réactivité parfaite échange en temps réel sur le site... Carl nous a gardé nos bagages le dernier jour un gros + quand vous avez l'avion en debut de soirée. Situation géographique parfaite pour visiter Montréal","8"
"Its just as the pictures show!! And he is very helpful!!","8"
"I recommend this apartment to anybody who is visiting Montreal!","8"
"Carl was very helpful are friendly, the apartment was as expected. Thanks!","8"
"Excellent location and friendly host who is accommodating. It is very close to everything, but the place desperately needs some deep cleaning, because the first thing that greets a guest is a stale food smell that won't go away. Kitchen in general including utensils was downright dirty. Not bad, but not a five star residence.","8"
"Tarek's place is very well located and close to everything you want to see in Montreal. Tarek was very responsive and had great restaurant recommendations. We would definitely stay here again!","8"
"Great place for a weekend in Montreal! Very close to McGill and other cool neighborhoods, walk-able to great restaurants and sites. Tarek was a fantastic host and had great recommendations!","8"
"Carl is very kind, and quick with responses! Home was very clean! Grabbing the key from a dark alley way was nerve racking. Other than that, host was very kind!","8"
"Great place for a weekend getaway in Montreal. Within walking distance to many shops/restaurants/clubs. Had a very easy check in.","8"
"Great location, super friendly host, everything was as expected. Would stay here again 100%","8"
"This was my first experience with living at an AirBnb over a hotel. Carl's place is conveniently located right next to McGill university. Carl was always very responsive when required. I would recommend this to those who are considering a stay in Montreal.","8"
"was fine really and affordable with a good location. could use a deep clean and some extra bedding if it sleeps 5","8"
"Great spot close to the centre of MTL. Perfect for a  weekend getaway.","8"
"Great place at a great location! The apartment itself is quite old but Carl makes the best out of it: new furniture,  very clean and comfi bed. Also Carl was very helpful with everything and very fast responding. ","8"
"Great communication Carl really tried to accommodate our needs.  Great location","8"
"We liked to stay at the property: good location close to downtown and McGill U, clean apartment, quiet, comfortable bed. We used kitchen to make breakfast and dinner for our family. A swimming pool with a sauna were available (unfortunately we did have time to enjoy it), quite spacious balcony. ","8"
"Wonderful host who is quick to help with everything.  Great location near McGill - quiet and enjoyable.","8"
"Carl's place was in a great location, walking distance to downtown and cool bars/restaurants. Carl made the check in process super easy. The air conditioner was a lifesaver with the humidity during the night.","8"
"Carl was very available and always answered quickly.  
The apartment itself was nice and tidy,  and located in a good neighbourhood with shops and markets nearby.
A good place to stay !","8"
"Recommended for the location, so close to downtown and Mont Royal Park. The apartment has all you need for an easy stay. The decor is not quite as sparkly as in the photos and the taps drip, stuff like that, but otherwise we had everything we needed and Carl is an excellent host who is very quick to respond to messages and was very helpful in arranging parking for us.","8"
"Had a great time (stayed only 2 nights) in Montreal. Apartment is located in student district, spacious, huge tv and small kitchen. Would recommend for short stays!","8"
"The location of this place is great (very central) and Carl was a good host: the communication went well and we very much appreciated his flexibility around the check-in and check-out times. But we were sorely disappointed with the apartment in itself. Why? Because while the pictures correspond to what we were looking for, the actual place did not: the state of renovation is far from being as good as suggested by the description and pictures (ex: there was a big hole in the bathroom door, by the doorknob, that was filled with kitchen paper, and that is just one example); the place could use a deep clean and we were greeted by a hospital smell that we could not get rid of during our stay. If you are seduced by the idea of using the pool, beware: we love swimming and were planning to use it but did not because its cleanliness was very questionable (there were for example what seemed to be dead spiders at the bottom of it). This place is for people who want a place to sleep and be on their way.","8"
"Great location but be ready to be in student housing. Good wifi. Nice furniture. But really old bathroom and kitchen. Very responsive host","8"
"Local extremamente bem localizado. Indicado para viagens curtas ou longas. Gostamos muito da hospedagem e recepção com a ajuda de Carl.","8"
"This was in a perfect location, the apartment was a bit less boujee than the pictures made it seem but it was perfect for us and our stay!","8"
"I do not recommend this place at all. The pictures are so misleading. It looks luxurious, it is nothing but. I so wish I could add in my own pictures, the actually reality of what this place looks like, for exemple an improperly installed bathroom door knob stuffed with toilet paper, and with visible screws. Filth on the walls, on the fan. A flimsy piece of plastic/cardboard in the top part of the window were the AC unit is installed. It felt so unsafe we did not leave any valuables every time we left the Airbnb. 2 towels for 5people for 3days 2nights (that includes the hand towel and then there is no mat for coming out of the shower, so basically that leaves no towels for showers, we used our own towels we’d brought for swimming) and when I asked for more towels that did nothappen , I was ignored completely on that request. But we ended up using our own towels, because we saw a beautiful pool in the pictures. Well turns out the pool wasn’t as expected at all. It was too cold to swim and the place looked like it was in need of repairs (holes in the ceiling) just bad! 
The dresser had a broken drawer bottom, when I attempted to open the closet in the bedroom the knob came off in my hand, the closet door wasn’t on right and difficult to manage. The toilet didn’t flush properly, the bathroom sink was leaking and the caulking in the bathroom was coming apart and either dirty or moldy. The walls were filthy, I could see where posters had been on those walls in the past. Gross. 

This is so dishonest. This is not right. 
Awful. Awful. Awful. 
You want to rent your place, that’s fine. Don’t need to steal from honest people. Just sell what you have to offer, don’t mislead people and on top of it bully them into giving you a five star 5 rating. I paid. Therefor I have paid my right to say my honest opinion and I don’t want anyone else to get ripped off by you.","8"
"It is a clean and comfortable place to live and the host reply the message very fast.
Especially the location is very convenient to travel most of the tourist spot. My family and I  had a good time staying there.","8"
"Location may be what you are looking for; be sure to inquire and make arrangements in advance for parking and for key access prior to booking to ensure that the process fits your expectations.   Host communication is great and issues are attended to immediately.","8"
"We booked this Airbnb for a group of 4 guests. Check-in was a fast and easy process. Upon arrival we were very satisfied with how neat, and clean the furniture and apartment were. We enjoyed the location - walking distance to major sites of the city (St. Laurent, downtown Montreal, Mount-Royal Hiking Trail, and 10mins drive to Old Port Montreal). Carl was very helpful in providing us with suggestions on places to visit/dine, and responded fast to calls and texts! Furniture was nice, one bedroom with a bed and couch, living room with pull out couch, tv, and dining table, kitchen and patio available. The infrastructure of apartment and building was a bit old. Apartment was located in a safe area to walk in at night. Overall, we had an amazing stay,  and would recommend it to anyone for short-stays.","8"
"Great location, but needs maintenance.","8"
"Perfect location for our visit to McGill for their open house! We were comfortable and enjoyed the neighborhood very much. Plug for Lola Rosa restaurant!!!! Carl's place was just what we needed! Carl was very good at communicating and kept in touch throughout our visit. Make sure you get all his texts/messages before you arrive so you are informed about parking and access to the apartment. We drove from quite a distance and couldn't download all of them before we arrived...all worked out just fine.  Thanks for a great weekend in Montreal!","8"
"Carl’s place is walking distance to everywhere you want to visit in Montréal. It is a little bit smaller and less luxurious than it seems in the pictures, as it is a student residece.But overall it was a pleasant trip if you are looking for home one person or even more.","8"
"i had a nice stay at Carl’s place! The communication was perfect, the check in easy. The house was super clean, the bed was very comfortable. The location is also good, close to the subway, stores. The little patio is perfect if you smoke. 
I recommend this place!","8"
"This is a wonderful place to stay! Great layout, very clean, within easy walking distance to everything. Carl is a kind and responsive host, I always try to stay at one of his locations when I'm in Montreal.","8"
"A good host.
an old apartment and smaller than i expected .","8"
"Logement très bien situé, à proximité du centre-ville !","8"
"Excellent","8"
"It’s a nice place to stay!!","8"
"My friend and I had a great time staying at Carl's place! As other reviewers have said, it's a nice place with some old features but the location, responsiveness from host and parking all make up for that! The decor is new and modern and the bed was really comfortable! I would definitely stay here again (maybe in the summer when it's not so cold)! Also check-in and check-out were SO easy and convenient!","8"
"The place was just how it looked like in the pictures. The balcony was actually very spacious. The TV also had Spotify and YouTube on it, so it was perfect as we didn’t need to use our speakers to listen to music. Very close to McGill as well as shopping and a SAQ (liquor store).","8"
"The photos are misleading - the apartment is old and fairly shabby with new Ikea furniture. Also - it's freezing (my phone said inside temp was 12 degrees C)! We cranked the heat and I still could not sleep because I was so cold. I almost wore my coat to bed. I wish I had. For the location (close to McGill) and the price point, I'm not surprised. It's an old building that desperately needs updating. Some fairly simple repairs are neglected in favour of shoving plastic bags and toilet paper into crevices or hiding them behind paintings. If you're only worried about location and price, it's a decent place to stay (maybe not in winter though). We were just looking for a warm place to wait out a snow storm and unfortunately we were very disappointed since we were still so cold! Check in was a breeze and Carl was very quick to respond and easily reached.","8"
"Nous sommes resté-e-s 2 jours à Montréal. Thanks to Carl ! Il a été réactif et à adapter tant le check in que le check out. Il s'est soucié que nous soyons à notre aise !","8"
"Nice","8"
"Great location. Exactly as described. Great value for price point. Great communication with hosts. Very comfortable stay. Would stay here again or recommend in a heartbeat.","8"
"Location is great, perfect and close to downtown areas! Would recommend to all","8"
"Good location, good pricing, a little cold at night in the winter but manageable with the extra blankets and radiator. Parking was a bit of an issue but I was assured that it was not usually like that and was accommodated for accordingly. Check in instructions were also a little unclear but the host was able to get in contact and explain them once we had arrived.","8"
"The space was exactly as shown in the pictures! It is perfect for a couple that is going down there to explore around as it is very close to everything. Overall great stay, thank you Carl!","8"
"Great stay at Carl’s place! Really cute place. Great location too :)","8"
"Very close to everything and a very comfortable apartment... just some cleanliness issues and make sure you bring your own towel. I also got a $54 parking ticket because I parked out front where I was told was ok to park.",""
"Very cozy and charming place in the heart of Little Italy. I haven't met Ollie, but he was very attentious and gave many helpful information about his place and the neighbourhood. There is everything you may need during your stay, even a barbecue in the backyard for sunny days in Montreal. The rooms are clean and the decoration is really nice. There is no TV, but I didn's miss it anyway. I do recommend it for a couple visiting Montreal. Many thanks, Ollie!","9"
"This place is wonderful super clean and cozy! We loved the style and the decoration of the place and it had all the amenities we needed.
The location is perfect , near the metro, groceries and very good restaurants. 
Olly is the best host, extremely helpful !
I would love to return!! =)","9"
"Cet appartement est parfaitement situé, facilement accessible et très propre, très calme et bien chauffé l'hiver, on y trouve toutes les commodités et les éléments nécessaires à notre confort. Ivonne est une personne accueillante, disponible et très réactive. À refaire avec plaisir","9"
"Impeccable
Identique au photos","9"
"A clean, new, beautifully designed space with delightful hosts. Stay here","9"
"Ivonne's place was clean and beautiful and I had the place to myself, which was great. She had an alarm system so I felt safe and it was easy to check-in. Location was great, in the middle of the Plateau. The only issue, which was quite disappointing is that her place did not provide wifi although it said on the website said that it was part of the amenities. It was also annoying that she did not warn me of this and that it took her quite a while to tell me and I had to text and ask her multiple times about it before she told me that it had been cut off. This was frustrating for me since I was there apartment hunting and thus was dependent on wifi for this. She also stated she would reimburse me for this but still has not yet and it has been a few weeks now. I understand she was travelling at the time but I would have at least appreciated better communication about this. If there were not issues with the wifi or communication, I wouldn't have any more complaints about her place.","9"
"Ivonne’s place is in a centralized area in a small gated sub community in the city. The gates, keyless locks, and security alarm add an extra layer of security. It was easy to access buses/trains and local taxis. There are also endless amount of place to eat, grab dessert, or grab a drink in the area.  The place is modern and clean. The bed is extra firm and pillows are really soft, so that’s something to keep in mind. There are two small windows in the room, but because of their high location they can’t be opened for light/air. 
I did not get a chance to meet 

Ivonne because she was on vacation during my stay. However, she is fairly responsive via text. 
Also, be sure to clarify amenities with Ivonne prior to your check-in, there was no wi-fi or cable tv as listed in her apartment amenities. She also didn’t have the apartment cleaned till the second day I was there. She did state it was due to a call out on the cleaners behalf, but she failed to leave me instructions for where I could find bedding/towels in the meantime. Luckily, I just  opened the room door closest, and I saw extra sheets and towels.  
After all said and done, Ivonne did offer me a small amount off for the lack of initial cleanliness and lack of WiFi and tv in the apartment, but her attitude was a bit nonchalant in general, which pissed me off initially.","9"
"Endroit paisible 
Très près des commodités 
Beau condo","9"
"Ivonne's place is the place that you are looking for, very modern, air conditioning is huge bonus, specially when we know how humid and hot in  Montreal in July. And also you want the perfect location which I would call it French quartier where you want to be in the summer. There is only one downside which the internet, with the internet it would be 5 stars place. Would I stay there another time, Big yes and definitely. ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Tim is a great and reactive host! He even left me a welcome gift! His place is quiet, clean and cozy. Its near metro station and a lot of great restaurants and groceries. Very recommended!","10"

"Super sympathique","9"
"Très beau logement!!!!!","9"
"J ai beaucoup apprécié mon séjour chez serge . il est tres accueillant disponible tout le temps son appartement est propre , calme , bien situé et confortable. Je recommande .","9"
"This is a 2 bedroom apartment that Serge lets you have all to yourself! We had little interaction with him but he was very nice. Only problem we had was with the internet, we were never able to figure out which one to connect to and what the right password was but we didn't spend enough time at the apartment to really try and figure it out so it was all ok!","9"
"This experience was an eye-opener.  You get what you pay for.  Coming from Western Canada the communication was iffy with the translation issues.  This seemed to be resolved before we left.  The host was made aware when we would be arriving...early evening.  We arrived at the door in this unknown neighborhood, and after calling and texting many times over a 2 hour period without a reply, were starting to wonder if we had been scammed.  Finally the door was buzzed open and we went to the unit.  We did not meet or see our host until the 5th night.     The  accomodations were modern, a type of industrial Ikea -look with cement ceilings and clean and simple design.   The bed is a mattress on the floor which proved to be very uncomfortable, along with terrible pillows.  There was no table and chairs to sit at, rather just a couch and chair.   The TV/cable do not work.  We asked about the tv several times during our stay via text and phone call, but were ignored without a response.  The fridge freezer motor is very loud.  There were no paper towels, or clean t towel or dish rag available., as well as no coffee maker(if you are a coffee person that is hard in the morning)  Many cupboards in the kitchen were closed off from access.  There also is no garbage can other than a small one in the bathroom.  The ad suggests and implies that you get the entire unit to use, but once there you really feel that it is just a place to sleep and shower.  Parking is a premium to find and may require several trips around several blocks before locating a spot.  This seems to be normal for Montreal and eventually you get accustomed to it.  Patience is required.  
All in all, it was a place to sleep, but we would not return.","9"

"It is quite the commute to everything we wanted to see around Old Montreal and the Gay Village, however it makes up for it because Serge's price per night is UNREAL with how AMAZING it is. Serge is pretty much a hands off AirBnB Host (which is ideal for me personally) unless you ask him a question which he replies in minutes. Such a kind person. Would recommend this site if you're looking for affordability and don't mind a 30 minute commute from North Montreal to downtown South Montreal.","9"

"Clean and tidy place in a great neighborhood. The biggest draw was how close it was to busy streets with bars and restaurants, and beautiful parks.","10"
"Nice place, very spacious, older style basement. Very near transit and a busy street with shops and restaurants erc. Sandra was very helpful with any request. Would recommend.","10"
"Sandra was very polite and cooperative, and the space was very quaint and comfortable.","10"
"Appartement en sous sol, spacieux et équipée (cuisinière, frigo, lave vaisselle, lave linge et sèche linge). Salle de bain avec fenêtre dans la douche donnant sur l’extérieur, sans rideau ni rien. Niveau ustensiles, nous n’avions qu’un verre pour deux, trois tasses. Pas de condiments (ni sel ni poivre), pas de pastilles pour le lave vaisselle, ni pour le lave linge. 
Assez loin du centre, compter une bonne vingtaine de minutes pour rejoindre le metro, une petite demi heure pour Mont-Royal. Arrêts de bus pas loin. Commerces proches aussi, très pratique.
Après le prix est vraiment très attractif !","10"
"Great stay in a beautiful area! Perfect for what was needed. Great restos and cafes steps from the apartment. Sandra and her husband were very accommodating to us, making for the perfect short-term stay in Montreal.","10"

"El alojamiento de Sandra y Gustavo es muy bonito y muy privado.

Mi esposo y yo nos quedamos acá por una semana y fue bastante cómodo. 

Estuvimos durante época de frío y ellos se esforzaron mucho por hacernos sentir cómodos en todo sentido.

Hay muchos lugares cercanos para comer y está muy bien conectado con autobuses, aunque el metro no está del todo cerca.

Hay supermercados y todo lo necesario para una estancia grandiosa.","10"
"Sonders place came with hotel amenities. Little shampoos and little body washes. Everything was wiped down and the location was perfect! Right across the street from the Metro and right on the main bar drag of gay village. I would say this is not an ideal location if you need a lot of quiet sleep. I travel with earplugs so I was fine but the floor does vibrate until 0300 with the club right below. Stay here if you don't mind the noise or will be out most nights anyway, it is perfect for a weekend getaway with friends! I was visiting when 15 cm of snow fell and Sonders gave me the option of staying another night when I messaged explaining. I didn't need the extra night, but it was definitely an accommodation that made my stay stress free. They had Tea and small Olive Oil packets available for cooking. The kitchen was stocked with every pan and cookie sheet needed. My only complaint would be the booking process. Sonders is an investment travel company. So when you book through Airbnb you aren't done there. You have to validate yourself with their systems and surveys. Save your time and just book on their website. I would stay here and try other Sonders Properties in the future. Safe Travels!","9"
"My friend and I had a great stay in the village, it was the perfect location to walk to all of the locations we wanted. On street parking was easy and accessible.","9"

"The apartment was so beautiful and in such a great/central location. Loved the decor, and amenities included. Hosts response time was quick. Definitely the place to stay!","9"
"Amazing place. Great location and easy access. One thing is that the bar directly below is very loud 7 days a week. The bass is blasting sometimes until 3-4 am. I had trouble getting to sleep until the bar closed down.","9"
"Had a great stay at the apartment, even though there was an issue with the keypad getting into the building. I text the number that was listed and received a quick response. Great service","9"

"Noise is crazy each night , bringing a laptop or a HDMI Chrome cast would be recommended too , otherwise tv is useless to avoid noise","9"
"Super bien placé , bonne logistique , appartement agréable .. attention cependant au bruit de la vie nocturne . Juste au dessus d ine bar disco","9"
"Overall very positive experience with this apartment. Very clean space and washrooms. Provides everything needed for a weekend stay (kitchen supplies, towels, soap, shampoo). Location was good but very loud at night so it might be difficult to sleep. Also the curtains are very thin which makes it very bright in the morning so it might wake you up early. ","9"
"Excellent location. Very central. Nice view of St. Catherine street. Beautifully renovated, very nice and clean. 

Music in the bar below ends at 3:00 am, but can start early such as 10:00 am in the morning.  ","9"
"Absolutely highly recommended, meticulously clean and well stocked. Strategically located smack in the middle of the village for those so inclined. Noisy and right above the bar which is fine for those of us who like to hang out at gay bars. Couldn’t be better! We will be back.","9"
"L’équipe Sonder a étais super ils ont étais réactifs et à notre disposition. Le logement est vraiment bien situé dans un des Cartier les plus vivant de Montreal ( si vous êtes pas fêtard je vous direz d’éviter ce logement ), ce qui est de l’appartement il est vraiment très agréable propre très jolie et très agréable.","9"
"Great location and well managed. Tastefully decorated.","9"

"The apartment is big, modern and clean! Jesus was an excellent host and even left a guide book of Montreal and coffees to use in the Keurig.  It was super convenient for getting to the Jewish General Hospital. It was a lovely home away from home for 2 weeks.","9"
"Jesus's place was absolutely phenomenal to stay in; it's a nice and spacious apartment in a quiet building that isn't too far from downtown Montreal (i.e.: 20ish minute drive). 

He really thought of everything as he made the sofa bed for us, left some dishes and cutlery, and had everything you'd generally need for a stay. 

I'd definitely visit him again when I go back to Montreal - my friends and I had a great time.","9"
"Simple, comfortable and great location!","9"

"O apartamento é espaçoso e estava limpo. Não conhecemos o anfitrião, mas auto check-in foi bem tranquilo. Jesus foi rápido na comunicação e prontamente nos atendeu, ao trazer os dois travesseiros que faltavam, já que estávamos em 3.
O apartamento estava limpo.
A decoração não correspondia às das fotos, mas nada que comprometa profundamente o conforto na estada.","9"

"One of the best hostels I've been to - hands down. The location is perfect for Montreal's nightlife, the kitchen, bathroom and decor are amazing. Highly recommended!","10"
"Super endroit, bien aménagé et excellent service!!!","10"
"This place is ideal for sociable and introverted folks alike- the space is definitely communal-centric but there is also a nice outdoor porch in the back and people are sweet. It is a lively space during the nighttime as it is over a bar but I slept like a babe no prob. The bar downstairs doesn't have a much of a beer selection but they more known for their cocktails and mixed drinks (very good, btw!). Definitely a place I'll go next time I'm in Montreal.","10"
"Worth every penny. A very modern space with plenty to do inside and out of the hostel. Great for big groups of friends!","10"
"Awesome place!!","10"
"Le logement est tout simplement magnifique et les hôtes sont très agréable. Tous est tres bien organisé, propore avec tout ce dont on a besoin. Le petit plus, La Distillerie juste en dessous est super avec de bons cocktails.
Je recommande vraiment ! ","10"
"This is a very nice set-up.  A lot of thought went into it.  The common area, kitchen and Lounge is excellent.  Very organized.  ","10"
"Ce que vous voyez sur le site Internet est exactement comment vous trouverez l’espace sur place.  Définitivement un bon rapport qualité-prix, très propre, décor et touches personnelles formidables, parfait pour de petits groupes!  Demandez les instructions pour le stationnement d’avance et s’il y a des événements dans les environs qui bloquent la rue.  Ceci vous évitera une perte de temps lors de votre arrivée.","10"
"Gorgeous space, very clean, great amenities, and responsive hosts with lots of recommendations for fun in the city.  Great location.  They seem to have thought of every detail when designing this hostel.  Beds have privacy curtains, individual lights and fans, and mattresses are fairly comfortable.  However, this is NOT FOR LIGHT SLEEPERS! (You know who you are.)  The bar below plays loud music every night until 4 a.m.  Though the space is well insulated, nothing can block out the thumping bass (including earplugs or noise canceling headphones, which is usually adequate for me in most hostels.) The hosts are thoughtful and offered to talk to the bartenders about the noise but it still kept me up every night.  They did also offer to refund my money for my remaining night’s stay if I preferred to find a hotel due to the noise, but we ended up staying as we couldn’t find an affordable alternative.   I would recommend this place so long as you are not a light sleeper (my friend slept fine though says she’s a very heavy sleeper),  but I will probably not stay here again for that reason.  It was otherwise an enjoyable stay.  It’s a beautiful space and most folks will probably sleep fine.","10"
"Brilliant little hostel with a sense of perfection and cleanliness, all equipped, the best of its price category I've ever stayed in. The bed boxes are superb. The Distillerie cocktail bar under will welcome you with a drink, we had a great night down there, bery lively.","10"
"Ce logement est vraiment à recommander! La propreté, la décoration et la finition sont parfaites. Assurément un des meilleurs logements que j’ai loué pour un week-end à l’extérieur!","10"
"The standards for hostels have been set on another level! Amazing interior with lots of well-thought details (lights, music speakers, music instruments, kitchen furniture,...). Super clean, easiest check-in possible, great tips for food and drink... Would definitely recommend without a doubt!","10"
"This is THE place to stay in Montreal. Great hosts, great accommodations.","10"
"Best place to stay in Montréal, period :)","10"
"I was super impressed by the accommodations. Everything is sparkling new and clean. Great location. I had no trouble sleeping in the pod, except there were no windows and I overslept a little.","10"
"One of the best options for any traveler. beautiful place with many amenities. my only complaint is that it's 25 minutes walk to the station and the sidewalks in Montreal are awful. put on a good pair of boots and it'll be fine.","10"
"Sejour d’une semaine et demi au Bed and coktail. Endroit super !

"Lana's place was very beautiful and close to the city. We loved staying at her house and she was very helpful with any questions we had during our stay.","10"
"Though we appreciated the comfortable beds in this home, we likely wouldn't stay here again.  The home doesn't have a bathtub (it's not the host's fault.. it's not advertised as having a bathtub.. I simply assumed it would) and for our entire weeklong stay we either weren't given the key for the laundry room, or the one washing machine in the laundry room wasn't working.  For a family with 2 young kids, this was unfortunate.  The kitchen is modestly equipped, and there are a few little broken things throughout the unit.  We're grateful for Lana's hospitality, but this just wasn't the right fit for us.","10"
"This is a great space! Very clean and plenty of room to spread out. Lana is very responsive and attentive to anything that came up during our stay! The self check-in and check-out were convenient for our late arrival time. Would definitely recommend!","10"
"Lana's place was clean and as advertised. She is responsive and helpful.","10"
"Very nice space, we were 4 guys and had ample room for everything that we wanted to do.  Host was great, always quick to reply.","10"
"Lana's place was perfect for what my family needed for a long weekend trip. Communication with Lana was very easy and she always responded right away! Being that we didn't know exactly what time we would be arriving the self check-in was great! The place was clean and had lots of space for 4 adults to stay comfortably.","10"
"Lana's place was perfect. Exactly as described and super clean. Lana was awesome with answering questions quickly and her place felt like a home away from home. I would definitely recommend and would stay there myself again.","10"
"Will be back for sure.","10"
"I have been living in the place for two months. Lana is a very enthusiastic and careful host. It was a great experience for family. Thanks for everything.","10"
"Hermosa casa :)","10"
"We were disappointed with our stay in Lana's place. Although Lana was quite friendly and responsive, there were many things wrong with the place which made our stay unpleasant. First, the location is very inconvenient as it is far from downtown and in quite a bad area without many things nearby. Next, the actual place itsef did not look as nice as it did in the pictures. The bathroom and living room was smaller than expected. Worse of all, there was no drawers or tables in the bedroom forcing us to put our things on the floor. In the morning, we couldn't sleep as there were no blinds closing the window, only a sheer cloth. When we tried to cook, the dishes and pans were unwashed. Overall, we were very disappointed and would not stay again. ","10"
"Amazing place! Thanks Lana!","10"
"Lana’s place was beautiful and had everything we needed. It was clean and inviting and my family and I would not hesitate to return should the opportunity arise!","10"
"We had a great stay at Lana’s place. Lana is an amazing host, who is extremely responsive.

The place was amazing and is a relatively convenient location. The place was stylish and clean. We are especially happy to have the kids room. My daughter love it.","10"
"Lana was a perfect host - provided bottled water, coffee, tea, and chocolate croissants! She responded quickly to all our needs and let us check in a few hours early. The Airbnb was extremely clean and very updated and modern. It is located about 30 mins (driving) from Downtown Montreal and wouldn’t recommend this place if you were planning to use the public transit (1.5 hours) My friends and I enjoyed our stay very much and would come back here again!","10"
"Very clean home and just as described. A bit difficult to find at first.
I would give it a 10 star if they were available!","10"
"that's a really nice house for stay, very clean and modern decoration. its close to shopping center. three bed room and big living room for family...","10"
"Thank you very much for the rest in your house! We are very happy to have chosen him. Lana is a very good housewife, there is everything necessary for living in the house, we will happily come to you again.","10"
"Maison fidèle a la description, calme, décoration moderne et très propre.","10"
"The place is very nice, exactly as advertised. 
Lana was very helpful and responsive.","10"
"It is good place as Airbnb , modern kitchen , great communication , clean , water and food as cereal coffee in place 
Well organized . Only the sofa is not really confortable to watch Tv . Good place 
Thank you Lana","10"
"Great experience!","10"
"This was our first experience with an Airbnb and Lana's place was perfect. I'm very particular about cleanliness as well as the quality of bedding and it was all perfect.  The townhouse is newly renovated and looks fabulous and the quality of the sheets on the beds as well as having duvets was very much appreciated.  My husband  along with my two teenage boys were very happy  that everyone had their own space . Lana was great with her quick responses when I had a question. I would definitely recommend Lana's place! Thank you Lana for a fabulous stay!","10"
"Lana’s townhouse was a perfect place for our family to stay while we visited family in the West Island.  Don’t be fooled by the outside of the building - the inside has been updated wonderfully. Access and location was easy and central to everything we needed. Perfect for our family of 4. Kids had their own rooms and they loved the toys and the Fooze Ball table! I can’t imagine spending more per night to stay in a tiny hotel room for 5 days. We will definitely be back!","10"
"Lanas place was great and very spacious","10"
"This was a wonderful spot close to great shopping for basics. It was clean and beautiful. Our host was responsive and helpful. The townhome complex was quiet with some green space.","10"
"The place was was very spacious, clean and confortable. The host was very responsive to everything we asked and needed. We enjoyed our stay at Lana's","10"
"Lana is a very responsive and pleasant host; and provided clean bedrooms and bathrooms. The rooms were comfortable, the Home was quiet and at a convenient location to grocery stores and other shops, located approximately 25min outside the city. The kitchen and living rooms were very spacious and updated. My family enjoyed our stay, and would definitely book again!","10"
"Frederick was a fantastic host, he was thoughtful and very keen to b make sure I had everything I needed for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The apartment is a large, study one bedroom with a fully equipped kitchen. Location is right in old montreal, next to the cathedral which for both tourists and business travellers is ideal. I stayed 6 weeks and highly recommend it.","10"
"Great location. Very convenient to restaurants, bars, parking lot, etc. Nice renovated loft style apartment. Frederick responded very quickly when I had a question. Thanks!","10"
"I attended a conference at the Palais Des Congres and this apartment was perfect for staying nearby. Modern, spacious and had everything I needed in a great location. Highly recommended.","10"
"Excelent","10"
"We came there for 2 days. It’s a perfect place for roaming around Montreal. The parking is just in front of the apartment which is the best part. (If you come in the car- you can see your car from the window) 
The place was very clean, modern and nicely located.","10"
"Extremely stylish loft and building right in the heart of Old Montreal. Tons of natural light and modern finishes. Highly recommend this place!","10"
"Appartement très bien placé et bon marché. Hôte très professionnel.","10"
"Great loft and great location in old Montreal in a quiet street at night. There were a lot of restaurants and shops nearby. We were able to walk to most points of interest. Check-in and check-out processes were easy to follow. If you drive, there is a parking lot on the other side of the street, which is very convenient. We recommend this loft.","10"
"What a great flat and what a great location!  Very sunny apartment with plenty of room.  Right in the middle of Old Montreal so its great for trying out all the amazing restaurants and bars in the area.","10"
"Beautiful loft apartment located near many shops and restaurants.  Very clean with excellent amenities inside. Convenient parking out front.  Would highly recommend.","10"
"Wow, what a place in Old Montreal. Felt like Monaco during F1, because you step outside and see sports supercars and cobblestone ground right out the front lobby. The place inside was also highly respectable and furnished to complement the great scene outdoors. Really spacious and clean. ","10"
"Exelente lugar, muy bien ubicado y con todo lo necesario.","10"
"Really great stay here! Beautiful giant old windows and a brick wall, brand new kitchen, really nice shower. This was the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to take a long weekend to explore Montreal. Location was perfect too!","10"
"Location is very accessible to everything. It is literally right beside the Basilica. Bella was very quick in responding to my questions and instructions are very easy to understand. Would recommend and stay here again!","10"
"Just a few steps from Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal to enjoy the lively city life in old Montreal! Parking is convenient with surface and under ground options. I would recommend to park underground at 500 Place d'Armes, Montreal, QC H2Y 2W2 where only 20 dollars charged per 24 hours and is safe. Also just 2 minutes away from this place.
It’s big enough to accommodate 5-6 people if you don’t mind to share one bathroom.","10"
"Great location in the heart of old Montreal.","10"
"Clean + great location plus nearby parking spot.  And love the modern amenities.","10"
"Amazing place and an amazing host :)","10"
"A weird mildew related smell lingers the apartment. Other than that, great location, price, and everything else","10"
"Very nice loft in a terrific location for the Old Port, Chinatown and the Jazz Fest. Checkin was very straightforward and overnight parking is easy (either across the street, or if that’s full - as it was for us - just a couple of blocks away). Would stay here again!","10"
"Great location and awesome place. We were there on the hottest days of the year and felt the AC unit wasn't doing enough, I struggled to sleep a bit. Otherwise, super cool and would probably be cooler on a not so hot Montreal day.","10"
"We were there for the jazz festival. It is a great place in an awesome location - close to most things that matter. Frederick was attentive and flexible. The only thing is that our stay coincided with a heat wave in Montreal and the A/C was not keeping the place cool whatsoever - so it was uncomfortable for 2 of the 3 nights while the hot weather persisted. Other than that, stylish apartment in a great location. We we would be back if given assurance the A/C issue has been addressed.","10"
"Proche de presque tout (métro, vieux port, basilique, musée des sciences, place des arts...)appart sympa et propre, communication rapide.","10"
"Very modern open space. It was a nice  place to hang out in the mornings with the big windows. Had everything we needed! Would stay again","10"
"Great place!","10"
"Bon rapport qualité prix bien situé dans le vieux montreal stationnement juste en face. Très pratique 
Merci","10"
"Great location in old Montreal. Spacious place for  a few people. 

Only issue I experienced was lack of the water tap working in the bathroom. Notified the hosts, and they were aware of the problem but I was not notified in advance or no apology/was provided for the issue which I found surprising. Other than that the place was as advertised and hosts were responsive.","10"
"This is a great choice if you are visiting Montreal's Old Town.  It's very good value for the location, quality and space provided.  We had some problems with the wi-fi and TV, but Fred and Kloe responded and resolved those very quickly.","10"
"Very nice and clean space.","10"
"Emplacement parfait pour visiter le vieux Montréal (à 2 pas de la basilique Notre dame) avec un design très agréable. Je recommande","10"
"A nice, clean place in the perfect location!","10"
"My husband and I stayed here last weekend and loved it. It's right in the heart of old Montreal which is perfect for midnight strolls. The place was exactly what it was advertised and it was very clean- which is the most important thing to me being a clean freak. Frederick and Kloe were very responsive and accommodating and if we go back to Montreal I would definitely stay there again. Checking in was easy. We actually stayed in for dinner one night and the place has all the basic appliances, cutlery, etc that worked out nicely. It was also surprisingly quiet on the street side as I was nervous the roaming of the cars would keep me up all night. I imagine there are a few airbnb units in that building so once in a while you do hear loud and inconsiderate guests yelling in the corridors.   But it's not that often.  If there was one thing I could change is the size of the bed as I'm used to larger beds but that is just me being picky. :)","10"
"Localisation parfaite.","10"
"This is a lovely apartment in a fantastic location next to the cathedral, a short walk from many of the sights of Montreal.","10"
"Loved our stay at this loft!  Frederick's instructions for our self check-in were seamless and made our arrival easy and enjoyable.  The space is beautiful and within an interesting building.  Our sleep in the bed was comfortable and the daylight in the space was beautiful.  The location is also central to everything!   Would highly recommend and stay there again on our next visit!","10"
"Frederick's place is certainly at the greatest spot in old town Montreal, literally right next to the Basilica Notre-Dame. This place is spotless and has lots of natural light. I had a great time relaxing at his place and explore nice restaurants, bakery, and brewery in old town with a 5-10 mins walk.  It's a vibrant place that you can feel the fun atmosphere from the plaza and on the street. Late night on weekends could be too noisy if you like to sleep in a really quiet room. Overall, this is a great place in old town Montreal. I highly recommend.","10"
"Excellente location, tres bel appartement","10"
"Fantastic location in Old Montreal. Very easy to find and get into. It seems like most of the building, if not all, are AirBnB units and that the host owns a few of them. I didn't have any problems with the building or room key pass. The walls are very thin and I could hear the neighbors doing things like using the washroom and opening/closing the blinds but thankfully that's the only noise we had to deal with and it wasn't a big deal.

The air mattress was easy to set up (it has a built in pump) and there were plenty of linens to make the bed with. The bed and the air mattress were comfortable. The duvets are thin but warm. The air mattress was easy to deflate and put away.

The shower has really good flow and the water is nice and warm. The handheld unit leaks a bit of water even when it's not activated so be careful that you have it pointed well away from the shower door or else it will leak onto the floor as a few inches of the door seal is ripped/missing.

I didn't use the kitchen at all so I can't comment on it. The only thing I did notice though is that there is no microwave, but there is one of those small toaster oven and an actual oven if you need it.

We had an issue the first night with the heat and had a cold night and morning. There was a lot of back and forth with the host as they weren't understanding me when I was telling them that the thermostat would not let me set it higher than 20, but they solved the problem by the next night (they provided me with details on how to reset the thermostat so now it can be set higher than 20) so hopefully it won't be a problem going forward for anyone else.

Overall a decent stay. It's a bare bones place but it's worth it for the location. If you're there for at least a few days pick up some extra toilet paper as they don't leave you a lot and bring some shopping bags so you can change the bathroom garbage.","10"
"Great location for nice restaurants and too see the sights of old port Montreal.  Hosts are very quick to respond to questions.  The place itself has  a lot of nice natural light","10"

"The place is awesome and we really enjoyed the stay.","10"
"Well-lit airy space in an unbeatable Old Port location a stone's throw from Notre Dame. I'd stay here again next time I'm in town.","10"

"The place is beautiful and appears just as advertised in the pics.  The location was perfect and the decor was just beautiful!  We will definitely return!","10"
"Impressively high ceilings and roomy place to stay.","10"
"Apartment is very stylish. I really loved the high ceilings and exposed brick. The location was great, it was close to Notre-Dame basilica, cafes, restaurants, shops and a short walk to the Old Port. We stayed with kids and being close to everything was a bonus. Frederick and Kloe were amazing hosts and very responsive. When we had a problem with air mattress, they quickly responded and provided another one. I would definitely recommend this place.","10"
"Really great place. We have everything we needed and the place was warm and clean. Paid parking lot across the street. Starbucks and two breakfast places within a two minute walk.","10"
"Great location, very clean and spacious. Great communication on very short notice","10"
"The room is in a beautiful part of town and was clean and comfortable to stay in. Lots of natural light! 

The locking mechanism for the room when I stayed was somewhat unreliable. The hosts were informed and will hopefully address the issue.","10"
"Loved staying at this place. Conveniently located in the heart of old Montreal, super clean, stylish, and extremely comfortable. Everything you need to cook or relax is available at this place. Super spacious with plenty of light. Extremely recommend this place. Easy check-in & check-out. If I ever go back to Montreal, I’ll definitely stay at this place again in a heart heart!","10"

"Mohamad’s place was exactly as expected. Very clean, spacious, and located in a good location. My only issue was that at the time of booking, I informed him multiple times I would not be arriving until after midnight but he kept on insisting keeping the check-in time at 9 pm and to update him later if anything changes. 

Eventually, closer to the date I informed him again I would not be arriving until after midnight and he told me unless I found someone to check in on my behalf I would not be able to check in until 10 am the next day. Thankfully, I had a friend in Montreal who could help me but it would’ve caused major problems for me if I didn’t. I wish he could’ve informed me of this at the time of booking as he was aware of my schedule. 

Other than that, everything else went smoothly and communication was fast. I would recommend staying here.","10"
"My friends and I stayed at Mohamad's place for a weekend in December and it was a great experience. The place is very nice and clean and is in a great location downtown. He replies right away if you have any questions just text him. We had no issues with our stay.","10"
"Excellent host experience. Great communication, amenities, and cleanliness.","10"
"James' place was great for us, cheap and just enough. It's extremely close to everything and with parking! The view is fantastic. We didn't stay in the Airbnb much but the building is quiet and safe which is what we were looking for. The shower water temp jumps around a bit but pressure is good. The bedroom gets warm in the mornings, James let us know this  
when we arrived, and there was air conditioning and heating which was perfect. The parking is safe and secure as is the front door. For guests looking for a lockbox, we had to meet the host for the key. From there getting in and out of the building is easy. Thanks!","9"
"Quiet place with a clear view over Montreal and a private balcony. The decoration is mainly from the 80s but definitely has its charm.
James is a dedicated and reactive host, you can count on him !","9"
"Exactly as described. Great location for walking up to Mt. Royal or into the center of down town. ~2 blocks away from guy-concordia metro station. 

One other note: the walls are apparently pretty thin.","9"
"James met me with keys, and did everything possible to make me comfortable.  He even offered me champagne!","9"
"James was a great host and super responsive. The place is exactly as described, and we took full advantage of the great balcony by having breakfast there every morning. It was the perfect size for the two of us. The place is also very convenient if you’re planning on hiking up to Mont Royal and close enough to the shopping district on Sherbrooke if you’re looking for places to shop or eat. James also has great suggestions if you’re looking for anything in the area. Thanks James! Hope you’ll have us again when we decide to come back to Montreal! ","9"
"Un bel appartement à Montréal avec une vue du balcon très agréable 
Un accueil au top par James

"James was a gracious host and super awesome communicator. I had a great time and James made the stay even better.","9"
"Great parking! Our modest SUV fit under the low pipes overhead. Artistically appointed, and how did you fit that mirror in the door!? Softest bed in Montreal. We’ll be back! ","9"
"Great location and stylish touches!","9"
"James' place was great! It was in a very good location, very comfortable, and James was very responsive. Would definitely stay again!","9"
"Fantastic location in a beautiful city. Parking, easy access to the Metro & Art museum, responsive host, and many conveniences made this a great stay. Thank you James!","9"
"James is a great host and his space reflects that!   Great spot with a nice view off the balcony.  
Only warning is that his neighbor is crazy and possibly something mentally wrong with.  She started banging on our wall excessively when we made some noise at 8:30 in the morning and then told James that we were up at 6am doing all sorts of things while we were sleeping.....
Not necessarily the spot to go if you're going to make any noise in the bedroom.  Otherwise it was great with lots of instruction manuals and info.","9"
"I rented the house for 20 days for my parents who were visiting me in Montreal. We liked the location and the view very much. The price wasn't too high. The experience was okay but not the best experience I've had with Airbnb places. Some complications occurred, and the host expected my collaboration in solving the problem. The internet didn't work for the first three days, and it took the host some time to accept that there was a problem and solve it. The host was friendly and apologized when I expressed my dissatisfaction with something but not as respectful as what I expected. For example,  when I went to pick up the keys, he was still busy cleaning the bathroom and doing the laundry, and he jokingly asked me to help him with preparing the house.","9"
"Parfait !!!","9"

"We had a great time at Julia's place. The apartment is very neat!","9"
"Great value, Julia was friendly and communicative. Apartment was neat and comfortable. Location is far from downtown but is close to a metro station.","9"
"My family and I spent one night at Julia's appartment. The place is clean, spatious and it looks exactly as the pictures. It's perfect for four people. There's a subway station in less than ten minutes, so you can easily get to downtown and avoid traffic. Julia answered very quickly all our messages and was very accomodating with our arrival's hour.","9"
"Très bien !","9"
"Made my trip to Montréal much more exciting. Julia is amazing with communication, check in time was at 5 but she allowed us to come at 3 which was extremely helpful. The apartment was spotless and Julia was sweet enough to leave towels on our beds, leave us cookies and supply us with shower necessities. Highly recommend!!","9"
"This place was disappointing. Communication on how to get in was not clear. There was no toilette paper, or bedding for the ""SOFA BED"" (was actually just a couch) or the cot. There is also no microwave, coffee maker. Check in and check out instructions were not clear.","9"
"The place was small, neat and cozy. The apartment was convenient for us. The tourist spots were not too far away from the house. All in all it was good. Didn’t really like the parking system though.","9"

Nous y avons très bien dormi et l'appartement est équipé de l'essentiel donc on était presque comme a la maison. Il vaut mieux avoir une voiture pour s.y rendre en revanche. Je recommande !!","9"
"Very fairly priced, incredibly clean and comfortable.  ONE ISSUE out of their control...if you are a light sleeper, the noises (especially early in the morning) from the apartment upstairs may wake you.

Very close to the Metro (subway).","9"
"Julia's place is cute and very accessible.Communication with Julia was great.
The apartment is clean and has street parking.Walmart is very close.Public transit metro station is 5 minutes walk.We really enjoyed the stay and would highly recommend this place.","9"

"Great place to stay!","9"
"Julia`s house is beautiful and comfortable, we had a small problem with the shower and she fixed it immediately and let us a few presents for the inconvenience , she helped us with everything we asked. We really recommend her!","9"
"We had a wonderful time with this host. The house is near metro and bus, around 6-8mins walking; near supermaket. The house is nice and has full service. I love the decor. Julia answered any your questions. We have some problem with the hot water system, but I informed her too late so we cannot do anything. That's my mistake. If I travel to Montreal, i will stay with Julia again.

"Very quiet place, clean and has a washer and dryer, a bit old, but works fine. We were able to restock the clean clothes after few days of travel. 

Street parking is easy to find, no restrictions. About 20 mins drive from Downtown Montreal, didn’t use public transportation. 

Self check-in was convenient. 5 star from me. ","9"

"Very nice place. Location is 25 minutes north of downtown. Quiet neighborhood with side street parking, which does get full in the evening. Location of apartment is very close to fast food restaurants and grocery stores, such as Walmart. Home was nice and tidy. Comfortable place to stay and will definitely book again in the future.","9"
"The apartment was exceptionally clean. Good size apartment with 2 good size bedrooms - plenty of space for our family of 5. Everything we needed was there - plenty of towels, bedding and all the basics in the kitchen to prepare some quick meals. The air conditioning was awesome -
Never thought we would need it in mid September but sure did this year. Location is a bit outside the center which didn't matter to us as we were visiting relatives in the area. Only 5 min walk to the subway though - so one could get downtown quiet easily. Great communication with host and easy check-in.","9"
"We had a comfortable stay at Julia's place. The apartment is kept very clean.","9"

"Charlene’s place is really cozy. Also, She is so thoughtful and nice. I fully recommand this place :)","10"
"Excellent value, Friendly host, nice room and close to Metro for easy movement.  The use of the kitchen during my stay was a nice bonus. Downsides were breakfast is listed in the description but was not provided. Also was offered an early check-in which wasn't possible after my booking was made.  However, I would still recommend the room.","10"
"Very nice room in Charléne's home. Metro station and city bike rentals around the corner. Would love to stay there again!","10"
"In many ways, Charlene was a great host. She was very accommodating when it came to check-in and check-out hours. Also, her apartment is nice, has all the necessary basic features and would be clean for anyone who is not a clean-freak.

For us it wasn't a problem, we are very deep sleepers, but beware that the house has rather thin walls and you will easily hear noise from the rest of the house during the night.","10"
"Simple but cozy. Charlene was lovely.   Comfy bed and coffee was a nice touch.","10"
"Chambre confortable proche du centre ville et du métro.","10"

Je recommande fortement.","10"
"Charlene’s place is great for travelers, we only stayed one night but we rested well and she was really nice and welcoming !","10"
"The location is good. Parking was not free. apartment was lovely and French style. The indoor cat was really adorable and the most friendly cat I have ever seen! Charlene was cute,friendly and helpful! Would definitely recommend this place!","10"
"Charlene was a great host. She gave us all the privacy we needed and provided all the essentials needed for a comfortable stay. Can’t ask or expect anything else for the price. Charlene was even kind enough to recommend a great local live music bar for us to enjoy during our New Years celebration. The room is located at the front of the apartment, and it’s a good size. The bed provided is a futon, so be careful not to put too much weight all on one side - we learned this the funny way. We both fell off the bed while sitting on one side of it.","10"
"Charlene was a very gracious host. She was immediately friendly in her greeting and made me feel welcome. I also found that her place is a great representation of what its like for locals to live in Montreal. Thank you ! Would recommend.","10"
"Hôte très sympathique, parfait pour bien commencer son séjour au Québec !","10"
"I loved it. I needed a room in Montreal for a few days mainly for sleep and this place was beyond my expectations. Charlene and Simon are friendly and respectful. There were plenty of amenities I didn’t used but appreciated.","10"

"ÓTima estadia! Uma localização perto do metro, e o quarto muito bem cuidado e com ótimos detalhes.","10"
"Es una linda habitación donde pudimos descansar agusto ya que nadie hacía ruido. La casa está muy cerca de una estación del metro lo cual facilita tu movilidad, además de tener una plaza como a una cuadra donde hay restaurantes económicos. En la descripción dice que hay un gato, pero realmente no es molesto, ya que nunca entró a nuestra habitación, lo vimos muy poco.","10"
"Great location. Considerate host. Cool common area.","10"
"Good one","10"
"It was close to the metro station and very convenient. Charlene was a nice host!","10"
"Nice place, brighter than many Montreal apartments! Clean, equipped for cooking. All needed services in the neighbourhood. Very responsive and helpful host. Thanks for the great stay, Catherine!","10"
"Catherine was a great host! Very easy to coordinate with, accomodatin and flexible. The place was very clean and comfortable located in a great part of town. Would definitively stay here again","10"
"We really enjoyed our stay at Catherine‘s place. The apartment is really cute and offers everything you need. The location is also great: between Little Italy & Mile End in a quiet street. The apartment has a small balcony which is great for having breakfast or a glas of wine in the evening. Catherine is super kind and welcomed us at her place and explained everything. Would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Catherine was an excellent host. We stayed in Montréal during an extreme heat wave and she went out of her way to install an a/c and to make sure we were comfortable. She's generous and warm and answered our questions about things to do outside of the city, too. Her apartment is clean and spacious and gets good light in the front room and kitchen. It's also situated in an ideal location, very close to Little Italy and to Mile End. It's very easy to walk to where you'd like to go, or bike, or take the Rosemont métro. I would definitely recommend staying chez Catherine!","10"
"Catherine's place was perfect for our short stay!","10"
"Catherine’s space is great; good location, close to the metro and main roads should you need somewhere to eat, pharmacy, laundromat. We were in town for the Osheaga music festival so we’re out of the house most of the day, but while we were there it was perfect! Super hot outside but her AC unit did help to keep the place cool. Would stay again!","10"
"Catherine‘s apartment was a perfect place for my staying. Catherine is a very special host, super kind, warm, and she was available whenever I needed. The apartment is very clean and cozy, and it offers everything you need, plus the sunny light in all the place. It is within a great and completely safe localization, between Little Italy, Mile End, close to Plateau and it's just a walking from the metro. I definitively would love to stay here again!","10"
"Une super adresse avec une hôte très sympa. L’appartement est largement assez grand pour deux et est très bien situé proche des arrêts Beaubien et Rosemont (5 min à pied). Quartier avec de nombreux commerces très agréable ! Une adresse sûre à Montréal.","10"
"Très bel appartement, spacieux pour une ou deux personnes et très bien équipé ! C’est aussi agréable d’avoir Catherine en direct (hôte très sympa) et d’avoir un vrai appartement habité et non pas un simple business. Le quartier est top avec des commerces de proximité partout autour ! Métro Rosemont et Beaubien très proches de l’appartement notamment. 
Je conseille vivement !","10"
"Simple, clean, easy. Perfect location. Will definitely stay here again next time I come back for work. Catherine was very easy to communicate with.","10"
"This is a beautiful and ideally located apartment in the Plateau. The serene and stylish atmosphere, the ease of being on the first floor (which was also very quiet thanks to good windows and thick walls), the family-friendly decor and proximity to some of our favorite secondhand book shops, cafes and restaurants made this a perfect place for us to enjoy Montreal. The natural light and comfortable furniture made the atmosphere so pleasant while we relaxed after an outing. The communication with the hosts was very quick, polite and helpful. I highly recommend it and I hope to return here on a future visit!","9"

"I really enjoyed my stay. The location was amazing and so was Omer! Great communication and the check-in was simple. He greeted me right away in the morning at 6AM and stayed to talk to educate me about the location, places to visit and recommendations. It was very helpful. His apartment was awesome. Clean, well maintained, and in the kitchen there were all the appliances you would need to cook. Omar's studio was close to major avenues and the metro station as well.The location alone was exactly what I was looking for. There was so many restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques and pubs nearby. There is also a grocery store close to pick up a few things if you wish. All the top attractions are walking distance as well. This area is very safe. In all, my stay was wonderful! Thank you Omar for everything! You were the best host I've ever seen.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 158 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"It's such a nice, comfy and clean place. Great location; close to shops, cafes, pubs, bus routes etc. Nice host as well. Highly recommended.","9"
"Overall a good experience.  If you're looking for a no frills place to crash in Montreal (not spending much time in the apartment), this will do the job.  About a 5-10 minute walk to the closest Metro station.  Given the weekend (Canadian Grand Prix), the value was acceptable.  It did get a bit stuffy, as it's a 3rd floor unit with no AC, but wasn't a huge issue given the gorgeous weather during our stay.","9"

"Nous recommandons chaudement cet endroit.","10"
"Super accueil de Mathilde et de Max ! Découvrir Montréal à partir de ce logement fut un vrai plaisir.","10"
"Nous sommes arrivés facilement de l'aéroport chez Mathilde. Nous avons trouvé les clés dans une boite à clés, ce qui est bien pratique!
L'appartement est parfait! Tout est conforme aux photos et à la description. La salle de bain dispose d'une immense douche à l'italienne. Le lit est un 160 cm de bonne qualité. Nous avons séjourné au moment de la canicule et le logement est agréable car frais. (bien appréciable après une longue journée de visites). Pour rejoindre la station de métro ""Sauvé"", il faut compter une petite dizaine de minutes à peine à pieds. Ensuite une vingtaine de minutes pour rejoindre la station ""Champs de Mars"" et c'est 6 dollars aller/retour. Le quartier est calme et on peut se garer gratuitement devant la maison. Mathilde est une jeune maman alors on peut entendre les enfants gambader mais cela reste très convenable. En revanche on entend d'avantage les écoulements de la salle de bain du dessus mais cela reste correct. 
Nous recommandons sans réserve ce logement qui nous a donné entière satisfaction.","10"
"Le logement correspond parfaitement aux photos et est très bien équipé. Tout était propre. Mathilde et sa famille vivent au dessus mais je n’ai pas du tout été dérangée par le bruit. Le quartier est très tranquille, une station de métro pour rallier le centre de Montréal se trouve à moins de 10 minutes de marche. Il y a également un bus qui passe sur l’avenue.","10"
"Tutto e` stato oltre le nostre aspettative: posto bellissimo, pulito e profumato, e Mathilde e` un'ottima padrona di casa, accogliente ma non invadente. Per ogni necessita` riguardo al mio bambino e` stata preziosa... un soggiorno indimenticabile! ","10"
"Excellent appartement, propre, refait à neuf, à quelques minutes à pied du métro. Nous y retournerons volontier lors de nos prochaines visites","10"
"Great accommodation, really spacious and private. Nice location. Highly recommended!","10"
"Mathilde & Max ont su nous aider à trouver les bonnes adresses sur Montréal ainsi que pour la suite de notre séjour. 

Très accueillante et chaleureuse, Mathilde et sa famille a su répondre a nos attentes, nous la recommandons à 100%. 

Le studio est irréprochable en terme d’équipement et de propreté. 

Encore merci & à bientôt !! 

Alex, Lauriane & Nathanaël ","10"
"J’ai resté au studio de Mathilde pour une durée d’un mois. 

Pour ceux et celles qui souhaitent réserver plusieurs semaines: Sachez que mon choix s’est fait rapidement puisqu’elle était la seule dans tout Montréal qui offrait un logement entier (studio) près d’une station de métro et en plus qui offrait un grand rabais pour les booking de longue durée. Beaucoup moins cher que plusieurs locateurs ailleurs.

Mon impression: J’ai beaucoup aimé ce studio, qui était très cozy et propre. Il est situé aussi dans un quartier vraiment tranquille et facile à se garer devant en tout moment. Rénové dernièrement, vous vous y sentirez très à l’aise et confortable. Possibilité de mettre des lumières tamisées (salle de bain, chambre à coucher, etc), ce dont j’ai le plus aimé :) 

Communication: Mathilde répond avec grande amabilité et rapidité à vos messages et questions, et s’assure que vous ayez ce dont vous avez besoin. 

Je recommande pour quiconque cherche un endroit à Ahuntsic ou près d’une station de métro.","10"

"We had such a delightful time at Cedric and Yuu's place! The location is very close to the Metro station, bus stops, and nearby restaurants.

We had a blast overall and can't wait to visit Montréal again.","10"

"We had a great stay with Cedric and Yuu - they are very kind and friendly hosts, and they have the cutest cat! The apartment is super cosy, and we loved sitting out on the roof terrace as well as the great location. The access to laundry and proximity to the subway were also very useful.

He also gave us some great recommendations on things to do in Montreal. I would definitely recommend staying with him.","10"
"Great price/quality. Cedric is a very friendly and social host. Some shared rooms were a bit messy but overall we had 3 good nights at the place. It is between mont royal, old center and olympics 1976 area in, so ideal if you want to see all of Montréal. Public transport is very easy and we recommend to rent a bike for $5 a day. Both options are very close to Cedric’s place.","10"

"Cedric was really nice to chat with and offered a lot of help pointing out places of interests.

"Great location! Just minutes away from public transit and lots of shopping along Ste. Catherine. Check in was easy, and the concierge gave us no trouble at all. The room has lots of space, and is very accommodating for large groups. Will definitely book again! Highly recommend.","10"
"The apartment was great to stay in. A very spacious space for my friends and I.  The location was fantastic with everything we needed close by.","10"
"The location and the floor to ceiling windows are the selling features here. Mohammed is easy to communicate with and quick to respond. It ranks better than average amongst the places I`ve stayed in Montreal, and its central to most highlights in the downtown core. It offers a better price than many, but is a little lacking in amenities. All in all, we had a good time here.","10"
"A large space with two bedrooms and two washroom that is in the centre of everything. Mohammed was very responsive. Looking forward to staying there again.","10"
"Great place, super spacious and comfy beds! Great location, everything you could need! Mohammad was very nice and responded quickly! Would definitely stay again!","10"

"Great location.","10"
"Excellent place in heart of downtown in a nice area. Quiet. Huge 2 bedroom condo.","10"
"J'y retournerais sans hésité !","10"
"Great spot!  Heart of downtown.  Parking's not fun or cheap but that's to be expected downtown.  Living room with floor to ceiling windows is great.  Somewhat hard to sleep in on sunny days with the light curtains but the windows when closed, block out the noise really well.  The host is very accommodating and quick to respond!","10"
"Mohammed’s place was very spacious and clean. The parking lot across from he street was very helpful and the proximity to nightlife, great restaurants and shopping were a major bonus!","10"
"Great place, spacious, host is quick to get back to you and very polite. I would highly recommend this location.","10"
"Great host, very fast to respond! Great space and amazing location. Will definitely stay here again.","10"
"Mohammed’s place was amazing! I asked him many questions as it was my first time using Airbnb and he was a big help! It was a great location as well everything was close to the apartment! I would definitely recommend to stay here he is a amazing host! 

Thank you","10"
"Super logement très bien situé","10"
"Such a great location and Mohammed replied very fast","10"
"Thank you for the amazing stay. Will certainly be back here if I come to Montreal again","10"
"Great location! Walking distance to all downtown areas.","10"
"We really loved the location of the apartment and how spacious it was. 
Mohammed was super helpful and quick to respond. Very easy check in / check out process. 
Would recommend fo a group hoping to be downtown / or in the city for something at either McGill or Concordia, very short walking to either. 
","10"
"Everything was great and location was the best with all the places around Rue Crescent st.
Mohammed is a great communicator and made sure everything we needed was taken care of promptly.
Best location in that area and would highly recommend to anyone.
Thanks Again!!!","10"
"The place was good in terms of location. The place from inside is a bit run down...the furniture seems to b of low (Website hidden by Airbnb) of the beds broke when we sat on it...then there were water issues as there was no water when we woke up in the morning. The host was kind enough to refund 50 percent of the amount charged though.","10"
"Great place with great location","10"
"We were a group of graduate students from Southwestern Ontario visiting Montreal for the first time for a conference. From the get go, Mohammed was a great host. He got back to us within a few minutes and was great with all of our questions. The process of checking in was a breeze and the key was waiting for us. There were lots of towels, pillows, blankets, and other essentials. The beds were comfortable,  there were lots of windows which allowed for natural light, and the space was very inviting! When we booked, the amenity ""breakfast included"" was on the list (accidentally), and because of this mix-up, Mohammed had breakfast delivered to us. It was delicious and very kind of him! The location is prime -- it is right near everything! There is a Starbucks right next door and a convenience store a couple of doors down. It's close to shopping sites on Rue Saint Catherine, including a large Forever 21. Uber was very accessible with this location! It was our first time ever using Airbnb and we had a great experience. Thank you to Mohammed! Recommend this as a place to stay in Montreal!","10"
"This place is a fabulous find and an amazing value! Walking distance to museums, many delicious restaurants, and all types of shopping. It's great for a family with kids and has three queen sized beds that are very comfortable. Mohammed was incredibly helpful and responded to messages very quickly. We would absolutely stay here again!","10"
"Very spacious apartment. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. Mohammed was very accommodating with his quick responses to any questions or concerns we had. Very great location!","10"
"Mohammed was extremely responsive and very hospitable. He gave us an extra set of keys upon request and arranged to fix an issue with one of the beds as soon as we reported it. The location of the apartment is excellent. It's right in the heart of the Golden Mile and was close to the conference center that I needed. My only concerns were the upkeep of the furniture/kitchen. Some of it is worn or in disrepair. It seems people might be smoking in the unit as well (we are non-smokers so the smell was very obvious to us). However, even with these limitations, we were very comfortable and we enjoyed this space.","10"
"This place was in the IDEAL location. Super cute and cozy - perfect for a weekend getaway. We loved the big windows and two bathrooms. There was also shampoo and conditioner and a hair dryer. The stove was under construction but we didn't need it. Will definitely recommend this place!","10"
"Nice place and location","10"
"Un lugar confortable y con ubicación perfecta en la ciudad.","10"
"The location was amazing and super close to downtown. The bedding was super soft and the beds were very confortable! This place has the potential to be incredible! Beautiful floor to ceiling windows throughout. The bedroom with one bed could do with some blackout blinds as it gets very bright very early (6am!). Mohammed did provide a sleep mask and now I understand why! There are some small things that I think could be added to improve this condo! Things like adding a towel rack with hand towels in the bathrooms, fixing the drop in the floors in the bathrooms (stubbed my toe a few times at night), fixing the missing oven cover, fixing the drawer in the kitchen (as was mentioned to me after we arrived) and the broken handles on the bathroom cupboards would make a huge difference in this place! For the price, this place is definitely worth it. The location itself made it a fabulous stay. Other than a few minor details, we loved the place and would definitely stay again. ","10"
"Mohammed was very responsive: buzzed us into the place immediately, shared a second set of keys upon request and quickly. The only reason the review was four and not five stars is that the place was a bit worn (loose fixtures, limited kitchenware). Overall, we were very pleased with the stay, location, value, and certainly the host's responsiveness.","10"
"Place was expected. Well furnished. Even though the kitchen could be better equipped. All in all a spacious apartment right in the middle of downtown.","10"
"Mohammed was a very good host. He was very quick to respond and answer any questions I had during my stay! We were a group of girls celebrating a bachelorette weekend (the two bathrooms were key) and the place was in a very good location downtown. It was also spacious and comfortable. It was a great value and I would highly recommend it to anyone.","10"
"Location was absolutely fantastic! Place was very nice and clean. The only reason it didn’t make 5 stars is that parking was a bit hard to find at times and would lead to a lot of driving around or a $30 overnight parking lot which can add up. Other than that our stay was very pleasant and if we are back in Montreal we would definitely stay in the same place!","10"
"Mohammed's place was great.  It was very clean and the space is huge with high ceilings and lots of big windows which provide amazing natural light throughout the day. The location is amazing and everything is walking distance away. Check in was a breeze. I would definitely recommend this place to others and I would book again in the future.","10"
"Large, Awesome spot to venture through the city. Easy and great communication with owner.","10"
"Mohammed was very responsive. The location is wonderful.  The apartment is very large with huge windows that open like patio doors.  The kitchen needs some attention. Missing drawer front, missing oven door front, not many plates cups, utensils. Great location. It smelled like smoke - could be an amazing place but all the little things have to be corrected.  I have stayed in many airbnb's and this is the first one I wasn't super pleased.  Mohammed was very responsive- didn't ever meet him in person. ","10"
"There were dirty dishes left in the dishwasher... the bathrooms were not cleaned well... the kitchen was in need of repairs and the apartment was not secure.  We didn't stay.","10"
"Stylish apartment in downtown Montreal.  Very close to all amenities.","10"
"Very good place and very good location in wonderful apartament. Perfect for 6 person no more.","10"
"Good price for a great location!","10"
"Good host. Very prompt with communication and the apartment is very nice. Good location that is close to all of Montreal.","10"
"We are still talking about how great this condo was for us. The location is unbeatable - a block and a half from the Museum of Fine Arts, three blocks from the Bell Centre and the grocery store, in the middle of shopping, bars and restaurants galore. We were two couples and the layout was perfect - bedrooms private and separate, queen beds in both and two bathrooms which is not common in Montreal.  We loved the spacious open concept living area, the comfortable furniture and preparing meals in the kitchen. Great gathering spot for us to sit and recount our daily exploits. Building is safe and secure and we were made to feel welcome. Expect light and noise because you are right downtown. Did not bother us as we found the windows really block the sound.  All in all the perfect spot for enjoying marvellous Montreal.","10"
"A beautiful spacious apartment in a great location, in need of a bit of tender loving care.","10"
"Mohammed's place was great for 6 of us! The place has plenty of space for a group of people and the location could not have been better!","10"
"Ein sehr schickes und sauberes Appartement  mitten in Montreal. Sehr gefallen haben uns die Kleinigkeiten, wie Bilder und Dekos, die die Wohnungen nochmal wohnlicher machten. Zur Sauberkeit gibt es absolut nichts auszusetzen. Die Kommunikation war spitze und es gab auf alle Fragen in kürzester Zeit die passende Antwort.","10"
"Great location","10"
"Recommended place.","10"

"great value and centrally located...will definitely rent here when I return to town.","10"
"Best central location you can ask for in Montreal!","10"
"Nicely decorated space with a spectacular view of the city","10"

"Great space in the heart of downtown. Very clean and stylish","10"
"This place is as advertised and the reviews I researched before booking turned out to be accurate. It's around the corner from Crescent Street, shopping and the Bell Centre are within easy walking distance. Bldg is modern, easy in and out. Mohammed was quick to respond to any questions. Would definitely book again.","10"
"Great location if you are planning on spending your time in MTL downtown! Close to everything!
The apartment was very nice and modern. My only complaint would be that the oven was broken - but I didn’t plan on doing much cooking anyways. Would definitely stay here again!","10"

"Jade was very quick to respond to any questions that we had. We were only in Montreal for one night so we didn’t cook but it looked like the kitchen had everything one would need. It was very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay!","9"
"Notre séjour dans ce logement à été parfait ! Les lits très confortable et beaucoup d’espaces.","9"
"Bel appartement, très bien situé. Il manquait la laveuse et la sécheuse, ce qui nous a contraints à demander de l'aide à des amis pour laver notre linge (6 personnes dont 4 enfants, cela fait vite de grosses quantités). Les voisins sont directement derrière la porte de la chambre du fond. On entend distinctement leurs discussions et les parfums de cuisine (essentiellement brûlé/ail/oignon) embaument l'appartement à chaque repas. On s'est arrangés pour ne pas rester sur place dans ces moments-là. La propriétaire nous a accueillis chaleureusement et rapidement présenté l'appartement. Il y avait même un cahier de coloriage avec des crayons ;) Il n'y a pas de place de stationnement réservé mais on a été capables de trouver une place à max. 50 mètres de l'escalier. L'appartement est situé au niveau supérieur du duplex. Les escaliers sont déblayés et salés régulièrement en hiver. On y reviendra, c'est certain !","9"
"I loved it and clearly i would rebooked it again!!","9"
"Très belle endroit parfait pour une petite Gang et juste en face du metro. Netflix un atout à ne pas négligé","9"
"This apartment is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and was very clean, and beds were very comfortable! Little things were included that were very helpful (cooking oil, hair dryer, etc). We had a tiny issue with a thermostat and Jade responded quickly and was there to help in minutes and resolved the issue immediately. We were in town wedding dress shopping and she gave us some really great tips. It is directly across the street from a metro and bus station and cabs are always around. It was also a 5 minute walk from several restaurants and shops on St. Hubert street, including a grocery store. We loved it and would definitely stay there again!","9"
"The place was lovely and the area was awesome.","9"
"Great place and a great location !!","9"
"You could not find a better location in Montréal for super easy metro access and finding everything you need within walking distance. Apartment was spotless, beds were very comfortable and we loved the bright but cozy kitchen. Since we were a big group, another comfortable chair or 2 in living room would have been nice, but it worked out great for us. Very easy to find as we arrived at different times. Do note there are external stairs to reach 2nd floor apartment which might be tricky for some if there are any mobility issues.","9"
"Très bel appartement","9"
"Jade’ place was extremely stylish and extremely close to the metro. I would love to come back!","9"
"Very nice place, updated and modern. Great neighborhood and friendly host. Book it!","9"
"Jade was extremely accommodating. She welcomed my friends and I with open arms. I give her home a 10/10 for cleanliness, everything you needed was provided and the decoration was very unique. She's also very approaching and I always asked her many questions and she would answer right away! It was really easy communicating with her. For the location: the metro is literally right in front of the property, which is easy to get to other places. I suggest everyone who comes and visit Montreal to book this place! Jade is amazing.","9"
"Booked this place for a night with a group of 10 and and it was an amazing decision! The house is very well kept with an awesome chic design. Jade was amazing at answering questions very quickly and helping us make the most of our stay. Thanks again Jade! We all had a great time!","9"
"Jade’s place is super cozy, with good design and very acommodating for the people who travel as a group. She was also responding fast and all the pictures in airbnb was actually aligned with reality. I recommend her place to anyone :)","9"
"One of the best place to
Live in Montreal and very close to public transportation....","9"
"We were a group of nine friends getting together for a wedding and this place was an awesome home base for us. It has a large common area, and is in an interesting neighbourhood close to the metro. Jade was super-accommodating and easy to communicate with -- would recommend this place to any group looking for a Montreal apartment.","9"
"Jade’s place was clean and well-appointed. Her communication during our stay was always quick and very responsive. 

There was a mishap with our kitchen appliances leaking to the downstairs apartment, but Jade went out of her way to ensure it was as non-disruptive as possible. 

Overall, we had a great stay and would stay again!","9"
"The apartment was honestly really nice! Exactly as described and pictured. The location is flawless, 30 second walk to a metro station on the orange line which was amazing. Only problem was the parking, signs are not accurate and I did get 2 tickets. Over all, great stay.","9"
"Loved the piano in one of the rooms! Overall a great stay and fast response to my messages.","9"

"Jade’s apartment was very clean, had all basic amenities (towels, soap, toilet paper, cups, dishes, pans, sheets/pillows, etc), cute and stylish furniture, and in a wonderful location. It comfortably fit a bachelorette party of 10. A train station is right across the street and the apartment is walking distance to some great shops/restaurants, too. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Jade was quick to respond to all my questions! ","9"
"Great place to stay! Enjoyed it very much!","9"
"okay place.","9"
"This is a great location about a 15min uber from downtown. The neighborhood is filled with stores, cafes and good food. The place itself is better then the pictures. Real tight for 12 but 10 sharing beds is fine if you are okay with one bathroom. We had 7 and it worked great. ","9"
"A great place to stay for a big group! The home is in a great residential location, very clean, has all the essential amenities, and is stylish. Everyone in our big group of 10 just love the place. Jade is also a great host---very quick in responding to our queries, made the check-in super smooth, and provided some local tips in her website. Will definitely choose Jade's place again when I am back in Montreal.","9"
"Je vous recommande le logement de Jade très  bien situé très agréable, propre et moderne","9"
"The place was exactly as it was described. Conveniently located across the street from Beaubien Station. Jade was quick to reply to any questions or concerns. Internet, Netflix was included.","9"
"Great place, would stay here again next time I’m in Montreal","9"
"We loved our stay at Jade's place! It had plenty of room for our family of 5. It's right across the street from the Metro station, which was fantastic. There are no laundry facilities, but we didn't need them, so that was fine with us! We had a couple of questions while we were there and she answered almost immediately! The only downside was temporary and not at all Jade's fault. They are doing construction right next door and they start every morning promptly at 7, so if sleeping in is a priority, it might not work out for a little while.  Would definitely stay there again though!","9"
"The place was really good I love it definitely going back there","9"
"I stayed at Jade’s condo with a few friends for the preparation of my wedding and the second I came in I already felt at home, everything was sparkling clean and it was very cosy. Communicating with Jade was very easy, she is very responsive and helpful and accomodating. My friends and I loved the place and our stay and I would definately recommend it (there is even Netflix ;) Thank you Jade for everything!","9"
"Wonderful Stay.

We had a two day stay at Jade’s place with my family.

The amenities are just great.
Location is Perfect.

Just needs little privacy locks for the rooms.

I’d rate it 5/5.","9"
"The condo was exactly what is advertised! It was clean and nicely decorated. Jade was VERY helpful in e-mailing places to visit while we were visiting! We definitely look forward to staying there when we visit again! 
From the bottom of our hearts, thank you Jade!","9"
"We loved this Airbnb and would definitely book again!","9"

"Would recommend.","9"
"A very nicely appointed apartment. Walking distance to a lot of great shops and restaurants. Comfortable beds and we enjoyed the piano in the apartment.   There are steep exterior steps leading up to the apartment but this seems standard for the neighborhood.","9"
"Appartement très confortable, climatisé (ouf avec cette chaleur cette année !) très bien situé en face d’un station de Métro et proche de commerces et marchés 
À recommander ","9"
"Would recommend to anyone! Gorgeous, clean and comfortable","9"
"Jade's place was perfect for us. A group of girls visiting town for a bachelorette. The space was stylish, and the layout worked for us in terms of space. We had room to have a drink together before going out, lots of room for sleeping, and the air conditioning was a nice touch. We had a great time here!","9"
"Appartement tres bien situé a 50 m d une bouche de metro. Decoration tres moderne tres confortable et tres propre. Nous etions un groupe de 11 et pas de probleme pour dormir suffisament de matelas. Le seul inconvenient: pas de coin table et chaises pour manger seulement bar et tabouret et a 11, pas l ideal. Je recommande cet appartement a ttes les personnes qui veulent visiter Montreal, d autant plus que Jade est tres a l ecoute des invités et tres reactive a toute demande. ","9"
"Great location, extremely clean and comfortable space. ","9"
"Jade was great host! Timely responses, accurate description and pictures of the apartment, great location!","9"
"Jade's apartment was beautiful and was a great place to stay for our girl's weekend. The beds were comfortable, the neighborhood was quiet, and it had all the amenities we needed. The apartment is located close to pubic transit and parking nearby was easy to figure out with Jade's advice. We truly enjoyed our stay!","9"
"perfect location. couldn't ask for a more affordable or convenient location that has everything a great stay requires. the Netflix account was a nice bonus!","9"
"Very stylish apartment, with plenty of room! The neighborhood has plenty of amenities, and getting around was very simple! We even found a parking spot right out front! The communication with Sonny was very simple and clear, and we very much enjoyed our stay!","9"
"Wir waren 2 Naechte in dieser wunderschönen Wohnung. Sie ist noch schöner als auf den Fotos. Alles war Blitzsauber und sehr stylisch eingerichtet. Die Betten sind sehr gut. Die Ausstattung der Kueche ist gut.
Jade ist eine extrem freundliche Person und sehr hilfsbereit. Die Kommunikation mit Jade ist unkompliziert, freundlich und sehr schnell. Das absolute Highlight der Wohnung ist die tolle Lage. Keine 100 m von der Metro, in der  Naehe viele Geschäfte und Restaurants. 15 Minuten zu Fuß vom tollen Markt Jean Talon. Ich empfehle diese Wohnung mit Nachdruck. Das Preis-Leistungsverhaeltnis ist Top. Danke Jade!!","9"
"Jade was a great host. I had my bachelorette party in Montreal, and 6 of us stayed here. It was the perfect place to hang with friends and rest between going out. Large flat screen with netflix, plenty of beds, dishes, towels etc. We would definitely stay again.","9"
"looks just like the pictures plenty of room for larger groups. perfect area everything is near by (metro, iga, shopping). clean. piano was an added bonus! jade was very understandin as one of my guests fell sick the morning of check out and jade allowed us to stay till we had to go to the airport. i would definitily recommend this space to anyone. it is well worth it!","9"
"Clean apartment that sleeps a number of people. Responsive hosts.
On the negative side, the apartment was not well provisioned for cooking  own meals (we had to request utensils to cook with) and using the dishwasher (we had to ask for washing pellets and only one tea towel had been provided - we asked for more of both). 
The access to the first floor apartment is not accurate in the description. Access is via an outside winding stair-case and some of the steps are rotted. The flooring just inside the front door may also prove tricky for those who are physically disabled as it is different to the flooring in the rest of the apartment.","9"
"The place is very well near the subway and market. the parking lot is easy finding. The neighbour area is quiet at night. Enjoy it.","9"
"Beau logement très spacieux","9"
"We stayed in Jade's place for a ladies weekend, and it was fantastic!  The place is cozy and clean, and the neighborhood is wonderful.  We were able to walk to some amazing restaurants, markets and shops, and the metro stop was right across the street with only a 30 minute trip downtown.  Jade was responsive when we had a question and check-in was easy.  We'll definitely be staying here on future trips to Montreal!","9"
"Jade’s place is a gem ! The location is great, really close to the beaubien station. There is a lot of nice bars and restaurants on the neighborhood. The house is very beautiful, with good decoration and all the amenities that you would need. We were a group of 6 and fitted perfect, even with only a bathroom.","9"
"Good location and I will come again","9"
"Un peu petit pour neuf","9"
"L'appartement est bien situé, proche des grandes avenues en direction des centres d'intérêt de Montréal. Pour ceux qui préfèrent les transports en commun, ou pour les jours de pluie, la station de métro Beaubien ligne orange est en face de l'appartement. A proximité, sur la rue Saint-Zotique, un supermarché IGA est ouvert jusqu'à 23h : pour les arrivées tardives c'est un point positif, nous avons pu faire quelques courses pour le petit-déjeuner. Pour l'accueil, les instructions données ont été très claires. Jade est très réactive aux messages. L'appartement propose des chambres spacieuses, les équipements cuisine sont suffisants.","9"
"La propreté laissait à désirer, le wifi ne fonctionnait pas et les voisins en dessous étaient extrêmement bruyants. Ne recommanderait pas pour un long séjour.","9"
"Great house. Superb location with the metro station straight across the road. Nice little area especially the bar le Vestiaire which was great for a few drinks in the evening","9"
"Jade is one of the most gracious hosts I have worked with through Air B&B. She was beyond helpful and accommodating!!","9"
"Very clean and a modern and comfortable space for you and your friends. Highly recommend!","9"

"Très bien situé, tranquille malgré la proximité du métro et des commerces.","9"
"Great location and everything was perfect. Jade was an amazing host and was always there when we had questions. Would definetely stay there again.","9"
"Très bel appart. Extrêmement bien situé, littéralement à 1 min à pied du métro Beaubien.  Plutôt tranquille et très confortable. Bien que 10 personnes puissent dormir, il n’y a pas de place pour que 10 personnes mangent en même temps (4 chaises et un divan). A 6 personnes c’était parfait :)","9"
"Appartement joli, propre et très bien situé!","9"
"Bel appartement, très propre !","9"
"The place is in a great location. 30 seconds from the metro and  stores near by. The place is very beautiful and clean inside. I personally had an amazing stay and would recommend the place to anyone looking for a place to stay or for event-like nights.","9"

"Great place very clean every channel u can think of","10"
"This was my first time staying at an airbnb and the place was amazing. Everything needed was in the house and had no trouble with anything. I would definitely come back and would highly recommend staying here for anyone looking for a place out in Montreal.","10"
"Beautiful split level apartment unit. Everything was very new and clean. Large, spacious, great shower pressure. Even the second bedroom sofa bed was very comfortable. Excellent location with lots of street parking and steps to the metro station and Atwater market. Loved it. Very responsive and helpful host.","10"
"Place was very new. However, because one host had given me a lower price than she should have on a month long stay, there was no attempt to provide the basic things I wanted as a guest like salt, pepper, sugar, coffee, tea, toaster, kettle, cutlery trays, hand soap, shower curtain, bath mat, facecloths, space for my folded clothes (it was all taken up by linens while the top shelves in cupboards, which I am too short to reach, were all empty) and most importantly, NOT ONE HANGER in the entire place. In fact, the other host said  that because the first host had misquoted the price, he would accept the mistake but that the place came as is. I spent over $150 on things that had already been provided in the many other Airbnb lodgings I've been in. Did I take it all with me when I left? You bet I did, it's my hard earned money. 

In addition, the first host told me that they would give me a good review even if the place looked like I'd had a ""hangover party"" when I left, in return expected a 5 review or they'd be kicked off Airbnb. Funny, I paid a cleaning fee and left the apartment pretty darn clean as I had washed all the towels and swept the floors (no vacuum) the day before I left. Yes, I asked to extend for another month rather than have to find another one and move but I was willing to pay the higher price rather than go through another move. They had other bookings , two that I saw in the month but I found a much better place for less so I lucked out big time! All in all, the three places at that location run by these two hosts are nicely decorated, good location but after dealing with these hosts, I won't rent from them again.","10"
"Un des plus beau airbnb j’ai visité jusqu’à maintenant, neuf et bien décoré. La Propreté des lieux est  irréprochable. Le seul point négatif est le bruit de pas des voisins du haut. Nous y avons eu droit une grande partie de la soirée et tôt le matin. 
Communication avec les hôtes rapides et claires. A proximité d’une station de métro et stationnement dans la rue facile.","10"
"This is a nice and clean place to stay. It’s a very good location and I highly recommend it!","10"
"luxueux et spacieux
en plein coeur de la petite bourgogne (super resto, canal Lachine, marché Atwater, etc.)
on met le pied dehors et on est dans l'action","10"
"Great place, with great access to the restaurant, theatres, and activities on Notre-dame. We will definitely be staying there again. Really comfortable beds, and the apartment was super clean. Communication and check in was a 10 out of 10.","10"
"The place is very stylish and modern, it’s a really nice place. However, because it’s very new, some things are missing (like shower curtains) and other small touches. The floors were also quite dusty in the basement, but upstairs was cleaner. Additionally, the AC was not working during our stay but the host was helpful in terms of offering solutions. The location is very nice and has plenty of restaurants and stores nearby, including the Atwater market. ","10"
"Nice, very clean place with plenty of space & conveniently located to Metro station","10"
"Nice place and good location close to transit (2 subway stops to Bell Centre), Atwater Market, Lachine Canal, and venues along Notre Dame. A nice part of Montreal and would stay here again!","10"
"Clean spacious and comfy!","10"
"Nice place","10"
"The place is super clean and well organized. I definitely visit again if I have a chance to visit Montreal again.","10"
"Frederick's place is new and stylish. It's in the heart of almost everything, and there are many restaurants just around the corner. There are 2 levels, and the bedrooms are in the lower level. The shower is in the upper level whereas the bath tub is in the lower level. There was a heat wave during our stay, so the air conditioners were a bonus. I had a rental car and I was lucky enough to park it right outside on the street in front of the house. I enjoyed my stay at Frederick's and I'd recommend it to everyone.","10"
"Great place in an excellent neighborhood. Walking distance to many shops and restaurants along st. henri. Right behind lionel giroulx. The space was very clean and was plenty of space for our party of 4 (plus a baby).","10"
"Great place! I would recommend it!","10"
"Nice place, in a quiet location, but close enough to the action. I really liked that the door had a key code to enter instead of having to worry about keys!","10"
"Frederick’s listing is accurate in the photos and the space was modern and very clean.  It was helpful to have 2 bathrooms for a family of 5 and air mattresses in addition to the beds.  It is conveniently located near the metro (about a 5 minute walk) and there is a large grocery store nearby as well as the Marche Atwater.  We had a very positive experience!  Merci!","10"
"Amazing luxury apartment close to everything! What a stylish way to spend a long weekend in Montreal with friends! We loved it! Thank you for hosting us! We will be back!","10"
"Great location, spotless place.  Def recommend. ","10"
"El Lugar de Frederick es muy bonito y espacioso. Queda en un lugar cercano con restaurantes, el Mercado Atwater para comprar comida y víveres, bares y fácil de moverte a múltiples lugares. Si te gusta caminar puedes llegar al viejo Montréal en 25 minutos. Bonito lugar y altamente recomendable.","10"
"Nice clean brand-new apartment.","10"
"The house is a good place to stay for short trip.","10"
"Good place to stay for short trip.","10"
"loved it","10"
"Optimal location! There are a ton of restaurants nearby, gas stations, pharmaprix, Atwater Market, SAQ (wine/beer store) and SuperC, all within a 2 minute walking distance. 

The amenities were superb, although we didn't cook, it is equipped with cookware/dinnerware - you would have to purchase your own condiments which is understandable (sharing these things are not entirely foodsafe). 

Street parking in Montreal is confusing - if you don't read French, ask the locals to decipher the signs, otherwise Fred and his team were quick to respond to our inquiries.

Keyless entry also meant we didn't need to fiddle around with key pick-ups or dropoffs.  Our group thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the convenient location.","10"
"Great location! Amazing space. Super classy and modern. It was close to everything. (5-10 minute Uber ride to downtown, old port, Westmount...) would stay here again and would recommend to friends :)","10"
"This place was great for our needs. We were in town for work and this location/ accommodation met all our needs. We were one couple and a friend. Communication with the host and co-hosts was very easy and as was the self-check-in. The apartment is located next to everything you could possibly desire,  my tip would be to go to Foiegwa and order the pasta or burger dish!","10"
"Very nice and cozy place. It’s very big, and the area is close to a lot of restaurants.","10"
"Frederick's place was very pleasant and the location near the metro was extremely convenient.","10"
"Place was up to our expectations. Will be staying here when I return to Quebec","10"
"Great space. Good location. Would definitely stay here again.","10"
"The apartment is very modern and clean, and the location allows for easy access to the Metro and several nearby restaurants.  Very nice place to stay!","10"
"Great place for a family of five!","10"
"Very well located. Modern. Spacious. New construction. So please as a guest be careful not to break anything. I've noticed that in apartment 101 where we were staying a few items were damaged which means that some people were rough on the equipment. Too bad.","10"
"Great apartment with decent price. The on street parking was hard to find if you don't know French, otherwise it is great place to stay.","10"
"I had a rough experience with my last Airbnb host and was skeptical on using Airbnb again but I am glad to say these host have restored my faith in Airbnb. The place was even better than we expected and we can't wait to come back as soon as we can ! This is by far the most perfect experience I've had with Airbnb !","10"
"This is a great apartment located in a central area. It was very clean and comfortable for the group of four we travelled with. Frederick and Kloe were both wonderful and responded to my questions right away. Overall we enjoyed our stay!","10"
"A wonderful place,extremely exceed our expectations. The decorations are special, full of French style. 
The landlord is very friendly and responds fast. 
Will definitely go there again!","10"
"Great apartment in fun part of Montreal.   The apartment is very clean - looks newly renovated to me.  Nice neighborhood with cafes, restaurants, and bars right around the corner.","10"
"Amazing apartment and great location. The location was perfect and walking distance to great/trendy restaurants and cafes. Prompt communication and clear instructions made it very easy to check in and out. Very clean apartment with comfy beds and available free street parking.","10"
"Beautiful space, very friendly host and quick to respond too and also in a great location!","10"
"Great value for a very clean and big space! I travelled to Montreal with a group of 9 people, we were really lucky to find such a great place last minute when our reservation for another Airbnb was cancelled.  Raymond was the co-host of this Airbnb and the person I was in communication with.  He was extremely helpful and very quick with responses anytime I had a question about our stay.  The apartment was very clean and tidy, beds were comfortable and the location was amazing (could walk to many restaurants and shops).  Just have to make sure you are following the signs for on street parking in front of the apartment so you don't get a ticket.  Overall, we had a great experience and would go back again!","9"
"Un super endroit où passer un séjour à Montréal. L'appartement est vraiment bien placé et proche des commerces. Raymond est un hôte très attentif et attentionné. Aucun problème de communication. L'appartement est neuf et impeccable, nous n'avons rien eu à redire. Après avoir eu une mauvaise expérience avec un autre hôte à Montréal, cet appartement et cet hôte était une réelle bonne surprise et nous avons enfin pu profiter de notre sejour grâce à Raymond. Je voudrais vous remercier encore une fois pour votre accueil, pour vous être déplacé et pour toutes les attentions que vous avez pu nous porter. Celà a vraiment été apprécié par toute ma famille et moi même. Merci et bonne continuation ! :)","9"
"Le logement est vraiment très bien placé. A 10 min à pied du métro Mont Royal. 
Shlo est une personne attentionnée et très réactive à toutes les interrogations ou les remarques que vous pourrez lui faire.","9"
"Very cozy apartment with a great location. Was a very affordable and more preferable option than a hotel due to its location in a really cool neighborhood within walking distance of great restaurants. Was within a 45 minute walk of anywhere that we wanted to go/see elsewhere in the city, too. Only real issue we ran into was sharing a bathroom between 14 people, but that was anticipated. Great place overall","9"
"Disappointing experience. The appartement need some repairs and the host was unreachable when there was an issue. I would not recommend","9"
"We loved our stay in this magnificent Ground floor apartment and can't recommend it enough. It's in the best location in Montreal (Plateau/Mile-end)! The beddings and towels were nice and clean and so was the kitchen and bathroom. The home was large and it's stocked with all the necessary ameneties, kitchen essentials, laundry detergent for the brand new wash machine/dryer. They even had a Keurig machine and supplied the pods! And they had the hotel style toiletries (Shampoo, soap, lotion…) which was a treat. We really enjoyed the nice comfy sitting area with the large smart TV with access to Netflix. We loved the shops on Chic Laurier and the area restaurants including the famous bagel shop on Fairmount. Parking was super easy as we were able to fit 4 cars comfortably in the back and had access to the back entrance! Communication was amazing and Raymond was always by your side if assistance is needed. I will recommend this place to any friends who visit Montreal and hope to visit again in the future!","9"
"Our weekend stay at this apartment was amazing. It had a great location relative to all of our activities (close enough to walk to downtown, to restaurants, to the clubs, etc.). Very clean and tidy apartment that was roomy enough for 8 guys to sleep in comfortably for the weekend. 1 bathroom was not an issue for our group, as it was a large bathroom for the apartment. Back and forth communication was very fast and extremely helpful, and Raymond even helped us unlock the apartment when we locked ourselves out one afternoon. Overall, amazing time at a fantastic apartment! Couldn't have picked a better place for our weekend stay.","9"
"the host is very receptive and helpful","9"
"Fantastic location and a fantastic space. Would stay again! Thank you!","9"
"great hospitality","9"
"Shlo made sure that my group's stay was running smoothly during the entire trip. We had a fantastic time and I would highly recommend this place due to it's location.","9"
"Perfect place for large group looking to enjoy the best parts of Montreal. The host was prompt in his communication and addressed our concerns about check in right away. The parking spot behind the property was very convenient as well.","9"
"We enjoyed are stay here very much. Raymond was very accommodating and quick with responses. The place was clean and just a quick Uber ride from downtown. I would highly recommend his place for anyone staying in Montreal!","9"
"I had an enjoyable stay at Raymond’s place. It is reasonably priced, the location is great, and Raymond was attentive to our needs. The common space was a bit tight for our group of 10 but we managed. We were disappointed with things. First, the bathroom door doesn’t close (it swings open right after you try to shut it). Second, the WiFi is so slow that it was essentially unusable. Overall, I think the place is definitely worth the stay for its value.","9"
"As advertised and Raymond was a fantastic host and communicator. He was incredibly responsive and flexible especially when we wanted to check in early.  The location is good, heart of Plateau near lots of restaurants and coffee shops. The living room in the apartment is kind of small so not ideal for large groups to hang out. ","9"
"Great host and good place. Totally recommend if you are in Montreal.","9"
"great place, amazing for the group.","9"
"Great place! Very clean and in a great location","9"
"This place is awesome and exactly as advertised!!! It’s a quick walk down to Mile End and Mont Royal. Plenty of places to visit, eat and great nightlife.

This was one of the few places I found in Montreal with AC that accepts large groups. Would definitely stay again!","9"
"Great location and spacious apartment. Good reactivity of Raymond. 
Good trip :)","9"
"Good Value, Good location","9"
"Quick responses, great area.","9"
"I booked the place last minute but everything went smoothly. I had few questions but he responded to me quickly. Nice and clean space. Great communication :) 

thank you, my family had a nice time in montreal","9"
"excellent location. good value nice hostage","9"
"This was my first time renting a Airbnb.  We booked another location and the host cancelled on us an hour before we arrived. Within that last hour I was frantically trying to find a other place to stay. My boys and I just drove 14 hours to Montreal.  

Raymond is a life saver! The place was just as described clean and cozy, washer dryer. Parking was key! Walking distance to night life, stores, restaurants, grocery stores, short drive to Old Montreal. 

The most important aspect of this stay was communication!!!!! A++++

Raymond kept in touch to frequently to make sure that our stay was pleasant!!!

Again Thank you Raymond!","9"
"The location of the house is great, having off-street parking spot in the back was so helpful, and Raymond was super responsive and flexible. However, the apartment itself did not live up to our expectations. We felt that the Airbnb photos were very misleading. Future renters should know that the apartment is really quite small - for a group of more than 4 or so it would be very cramped. The photos were obviously taken with a wide-angle lens and lots of extra lighting. It's not a brand-new building and it's somewhat worn in some places, and one of the bedrooms has a plastic sliding door that doesn't close all the way, another doesn't have a secondary exit (window/door) for fire escape. There was a pile of garbage by the back door, including a discarded computer, broken furniture, and broken glass. One of our party found a bug and a hair on her mattress, though the house was otherwise clean. The walls to the apartment next door were thin and neighbors were playing music until after midnight.

Essentially, for flexible travelers okay with basic accommodations in a fantastic location, this would be a great place. For those looking for a little more comfort, you should probably look elsewhere.","9"
"Great location. Very clean apartment. Plenty of room. Easy to communicate with host. We all had a great trip!","9"
"Good place. 5 rooms and for the price and location pretty good.","9"
"I absolutely loved this apartment and would highly recommend it. The place was clean, spacious and well equipped. Thank you very much!","9"
"fantastic service loved my stay","9"
"Great place to stay, close to downtown and hosts are great, we had a minor issue and their response to fix it was incredibly quick.","9"
"Pretty great space for the price we paid. Check in was easy, just use the keypad. Rooms were a bit small but all 9 of us fit comfortably in the space. The living room area was able to host us all. The outside of the apartment however was littered in trash and was covered in ice, so it’s not the safest / most visually appealing air bnb. Area was perfect and close to shops, restos and bars!","9"
"The location is prime and the host was very communicative & helpful. The only thing was that the wifi was flakey and would constantly turn on and off.","9"
"Shlo/Joseph host a great place. There’s plenty of kitchen appliances, extra bedding and towels, and space for people to sleep! The whole place was very clean and cozy. They were always communicating with me throughout the whole trip. My only issue was that the bedroom behind the kitchen was cold (due to a draft from the window area) and you could only be comfortable in there if under the covers. Otherwise, me and my group had a great weekend. :)","9"
"Great place great host!","9"
"Super appartement propre et très bien situé (Metro pas loin et proche du Montroyal). Heureux de notre passage.","9"
"Pictures make the rooms appear larger than they are. I would not suggest a group of more than 8 people staying here. We arrived to the house to find that the parking spots were completely covered in snow and ice, which we had to shovel ourselves with one plastic shovel. One of our three cars were damaged in the process because of the icy snow. On top of that we were almost locked out one night because the back door's lock was broken (not our fault) and the front door's lock was extremely loose and then broke because of it. The Wi-Fi was terrible and I noticed several reviews about it, this is upsetting because all of us did not have service the entire time unless we connected to a nearby cafes.  Clearly there is little maintenance done on this apartment, and clearly nobody makes sure its in pristine condition before guests from another country stay in it.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Great location and very flexible our flight got delayed both on the way there and back and we were able to stay a little longer","10"
"Thank you Nat. My wife and I had a fantastic weekend. Very clean, convenient and safe location, plenty of street parking. Would definitely recommend staying here.","10"

"Nats place was great. The location is good. It's a 30 minute walk to the bell centre. Mount royal is very close by aswell. The place also features a nice concrete balcony area. The place was clean and had everything we needed.","10"
"Not sure if we actually met the owner of the place or not, but we met with Michael who was nice and showed us around. The building is nice and revamped, however it seems to be smack in the middle of the biggest hill ever. Don’t put your suitcase down if it has wheels lol

Parking is quite expensive. It is $20.00 per night but you do at least get to lark in an underground parking-lot. 

The place had a very, very strong smell of chemicals but was clean. Once we started to put our food into the fridge we realized that the fridge was broken so we contacted Michael and he suggested that we could stay at another apartment within the same building. The other place was much nicer and had pretty much everything we needed, except for a first aid kit. There was also not one in the entire building. 

The shower pressure was really intense. It was nice but also annoying as it would soak the entire floor even with the shower curtain closed. 

Overall it was a decent stay!","10"
"Great place. - as described in pictures. Convenient downtown location. Bus and train stops are closeby. The host is very helpful and easy to communicate with. I would recommend everyone to try this place. It’s super comfy and the building is amazing with a great pool, laundry and common lounge with coffee 24 hours.","10"

"The location is perfectly located next to Lionel Groux subway station but it's also very calm.

The room was very large and clean. It'a perfect to stay a moment in Montreal.","10"

"Everything was new. Elie and his family so warm and great. I would definitely recommend the place.","9"
"Great place for family. Easy access to Highway","9"
"It is wonderful apartment to stay with. great location  easy to access bus and metro. Received nice hospitality.","9"
"Overall our stay was pleasant and Elie was available for all questions. The location is great close to bus, metro, train, gas station and different restaurants and grocery stores. Walking is 5 minutes to all of these. We enjoyed the park for the kids which is 3 minutes walking. 

Parking and laundries are shared by next door unit so depends on availability. The apartment is loud by neighbors, airport traffic, and is located right next to train tracks. Just for your consideration. In the humid summer you would need an AC and this apartment doesn’t offer one.","9"
"This is a great apartment in the heart of the city near many stores, restaurants, etc. A short walk from a public park. The apartment itself is in excellent condition, but could use some more mirrors.","9"
"The apartment is very spacious. Comfortably fit all 7 of us. About 30 minutes away from the city with traffic, but aside from that the space was clean and had everything we needed.","9"
"We had a really nice time staying at Elie's home. He was a great host and very accommodating. I will let you know that it was super hot that weekend and there is no AC. We brought fans per suggestion of another review and that worked out really well!","9"
"Very nice, simple and spacious place. 10 min drive to the closest metro. ","9"
"The house is clean.","9"
"Bonne communication, personne honnête et attentionnée.","9"

"La chambre de Sindy est partagée avec elle, alors nous avons eu un lit double dans sa chambre, et comme nous étions deux personnes cela n'a pas était évident car nous ne voulions pas déranger, donc on ne parlait pas trop fort. L'adresse n'étant pas le même qui celui sur l'annonce ça nous a fait perdre du temps, ainsi que le parking qui était dans l'annonce comme gratuit, il est en vérité dans la rue entre 21h et 9h le matin, donc il faut chercher dehors. Nous avons pu profiter de la piscine et de la saune, et Sindy nous avait emprunté des serviettes, shampoing et savon. Il n'avais pas de déjeuner non plus, sauf un boite de cereal qu'était sur le frigo, mais nous avons parti avant 9h à cause du parking, alors on a pas pu rester long temps. Pour le prix et l'intimité, cela me fera choisir un hotel au prochain séjour à Montréal.","8"
"Très bon logement idéalement situé au centre ville, près de tout. l'appartement est super, propre.
Je recommande vivement!","9"
"The apartment is walking distance from almost everywhere in Mo freak, even in winter we had no problem walking to places like Old Montreal, Mont Royal, and Saint Laurent. I would recommend during the winter months parking in the garage around the corner, it’s about $20 a night. The apartment was neat and clean, and contained basic kitchen and bathroom supplies that made our stay easy. We comfortably fit 3 people in the apartment! Our hosts were great at communication with us, and provided a ton of tips on what to do in Montreal! I would stay here again!","9"
"Steph & Camilla's place was super cute and close to main streets. Super close to groceries, transit, SAQ, and Starbucks. Great spot! Would definitely recommend if you're staying in MTL for a couple days.","9"
"Came to Montreal for easter weekend and enjoyed staying at this place so much! Since it’s located close to university, area is full of places to chill at. Walking distance from downtown, old town and all other showplaces. Apartment had all basic kitchen and bathroom implements as well as change bedding and a lot of extra towels. Hosts were in touch all the stay time and really flexible and loyal about check in and check out time. Would definitely come back again!","9"
"Steph and Camilla offer amazing communication and a great, clean, comfortable place to stay","9"
"Amazing stay! Very kind hosts.","9"
"Excellente location, quartier calme et à deux pas du centre. Station de métro à quelques minutes et commerces à proximité. L’appartement est lumineux, chaleureux et très bien équipé. Les hôtes sont très réactifs et répondent aux moindres attentes, nous reviendrons !","9"
"Great communication and very accommodating. The location is very ideal. My boyfriend and I had a great time.","9"
"This place in a great location! Close to transit and in walking distance to downtown and Mont Royal. It was the perfect size apartment. Everything was clean and ready for us. I would want to stay here again next time.","9"
"Zentru (Hidden by Airbnb) ahe Lage, nette Einrichtung und sehr sauber. Lediglich baulich etwas sanierungsbedürftig. Problemlose und freundliche Kommunikation mit Steph und Camilla. Parkplätze und Parkhäuser sind in der näheren Umgebung leicht zu finden.","9"
"Steph & Camilla's place was a true gem. It had a really convenient location for travelers like myself who want to be close to the bustling city center yet have quiet and peaceful nights. The stylish studio apartment had all the amenities you could ever need, and Steph very generously lent me the laundry card for the washing machines which are located in the basement. It was a very pleasant stay and I would recommend this place to solo travelers/couples!","9"
"We have just spent two nights in Steph & Camilla's apartment in Montreal. It is conveniently placed, and close to everything.  We had arrived by train, earlier than the check in time, however, S&C were most accommodating, and the apartment was ready for us when got there, which we really appreciated, as dragging bags around is no fun.   The space was great.  Cosy and comfortable with basic supplies, plus a coffee machine!!  We found some olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which we mixed together in a little bowl in which to dip some crunchy bread, and had with olives and a glass of wine on the sunny balcony..... pure joy, having been on the road for some weeks.....Thank you both for a great stay........we would definitely recommend this place.","9"
"Steph & Camilla’s place has a perfect location close to transit, Mont Royal, Old Montreal. A grocery is at 2 minutes by foot so very convenient. 
The place was as expected clean and comfortable with all the basic kitchen stuff plus a coffee maker ;) 
Steph and Camilla were a perfect host. Very good communication, very accommodating with the time for the check in, and always keeping in touch with me before and during my stay to check if I had questions and if everything was okay. 
If I have to come back to Montreal I will definitely come back again here.","9"
"Si vous voulez connaitre tout le centre de Montréal restez chez Steph & Camilla. Un trés bon emplacement. MERCI!!!!","9"
"Great location to explore the city. Less than five minutes walk from metro. Building is a touch rough around the edges, but the interior of the apartment is nicer. No AC - this is standard in Montreal, but summer nights can be uncomfortable. Overall a good stay.","9"
"Beautiful home- exactly how it looks on the pictures, great location- close to downtown, and Steph & Camilla responded to me very quickly and had the best intentions while I was staying in their lovely home.","9"
"Great hosts that I would not hesitate to stay with again!  Their place is in a great location, just a couple blocks from the Metro station, which came in very handy.","9"
"Fantastic location and amazing apartment, very clean & everything you need is a short walk away!","9"
"We had a great time staying at Steph & Camilla's place, and it was exactly what we wanted for our vacation!","9"
"Terrific little place for a person traveling for work. Hosts communicate on time and professionally. The interior is well kept. Wifi is strong. If (like me) you like to cook your own meals while you travel, you will find all the amenities you need. Also, terrific restaurants nearby, and a bicycle sharing station is literally next to the building. ","9"
"Great location.  Clean.  Has a balcony!","9"
"We had easy access to the city as a whole and enjoyed our stay. Steph & Camilla’s place was great for a weekend stay in Montreal.","9"
"Great location with some street parking not too far off. Building and apartment are older, but very clean. A good value!","9"
"Had a great time! Good location. Apartment was as described.","9"
"Uns hat es bei Steph und Camilla sehr gefallen, auch wenn wir sie leider nicht persönlich kennenlernen konnten. Es war alles sehr sauber. Equipment fuer das Kochen war alles vorhanden. Wifi war hervorragend. 
Am Anfang der Straße befinden sich rental bikes, Bushaltestelle 2min ums Eck, direkt neben Supermarkt. Metro ist auch zu Fuß super zu erreichen. (4-5min)

Der Aufzug ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen, das hat aber nichts mit der coolen Wohnung zu tun. :)
Würden sofort wieder kommen wollen.
A&T","9"
"Steph & Camilla's place is in a great, walkable area of Montreal. The apartment is clean and cozy. The communication was great - Steph always replied to my messages and questions right away...and even assisted me in finding a free parking space just outside of the apartment building when I arrived. I would definitely recommend this place if you're wanting to stay in Montreal for a few nights!","9"
"Clean and well located to discover Montreal. very convenient to walk to anywhere and close to the subway as well. Steph was always available when looking for places or suggestions.","9"
"Steph & Camilla’s place was quaint and accommodating for what we were looking for. The price was right and the location was perfect. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. The hosts were very good about contacting us to make sure we were able to check in smoothly. The only drawback was that we visited during a heat wave and the place, like many in Montreal, did not have air conditioning. The building itself was also older and in need of a little maintenance. Overall we enjoyed our stay! Merci!","9"
"Well lit, very clean, adorable apartment. It is simply the PERFECT location. Walkable to Mont-Royal (for hiking, park-sitting/picnics, tam-tams on sundays),  the ""city-like"" feel of st. catherine and st laurent (lots of cool places to see, shopping, and nightlife!). I love walking and even walked to old-port (ferris wheel, ziplining, ropes course,  and lots of shopping and sightseeing) from the room! I felt very safe in the room! The balcony was a lovely aspect of the apartment. ","9"
"Close to central Montreal, great for walking places, particularly up Mont Royal. Apartment was as described.","9"
"Great location.","9"
"Our stay at Steph and Camilla’s was perfect.The space is cute and quiet. Although it’s located in a big apartment building, we never heard any of our neighbors. My friend slept on the sofa bed and found it very comfortable! We had great weather during our trip so we walked everywhere- mile end, Old Montreal, plateau mont Royal were all easily accessible by foot. Alex was also in touch with us to check in and responded immediately to our questions. I would recommend staying at Steph and Camilla’s to anyone visiting Montreal. ","9"
"Steph and Alex were incredibly accommodating. They greeted me and offered to help me with my luggage down the stairs upon check out (due to a small issue with the elevator) Also, I was traveling alone and felt very safe in this area and in this apartment. 

The location is walkable to most popular spots and the rest of the sites are easily bike-able. 

I really enjoyed my visit and this place was perfect for my quick trip. I would be happy to stay here again.

"Really adorable place in a great location. We had a great time!","9"
"Nice place, very homey. Good location, and right near McGill.  Parking is tricky in this busy neighborhood.  Apartment was as described. Quite nice but slightly worn at the heels.  It was rather warm when we were there and we did use the fan they provided. But all-in-all we were happy with the accommodations.","9"
"Great location, communicative and helpful hosts :)","9"
"Looking for a comfortable place in the heart of this city, this is your place. The apartment has all the amenities I needed to enjoy a long weekend in Montreal.","9"
"Steph & Camilla's apartment was clean, comfortable and perfectly located. The hosts were very communicative and helpful too. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Montreal!","9"
"We had a great time in Montreal. The apartment of Steph and Camilla is well equipped and was clean. The location in the centre of the city was ideal for exploring the city. Rental bikes were right in front of the house and a supermarket around the corner. Only the house is a bit old. The search for a parking space was a bit difficult, because all free spaces were occupied, but a multi-storey car park was close to the apartment, as Steph and Camilla told us. 

Steph and Camilla were very helpful and it was easy to communicate with them.","9"
"A cute and stylish place for the money, and in a great location. There were a few infrastructure problems during my stay, but Steph & Camilla were very nice and responsive about it. The bathroom and the building itself could use some upgrades. Overall a good value and nice stay. Thanks!","9"
"Good budget option with a few nice extras. Communication was fast and easy and the hosts allowed us to drop our bags off early.","9"
"Great little place in an amazing location. Has quite an old school charm to the building. Easy check in and great comms. Would stay there again!","9"
"We had a great stay at Steph & Camilla's Airbnb! The communication was super easy, early check in was possible, the location is great and the apartment offers everything that you need for a great time in Montreal! Definitely would come back!","9"
"It was a nice apartment, a bit smaller than pictured and the overall building was a bit sketchy and problematic. The hosts answered all questions quickly.","9"
"We had such a great stay! The apartment was just as expected. Friendly neighbors too which is always a plus. Amazing location. We drove from NYC and the parking was easily accessible, not expensive (about $17 for 24 hours) and right around the corner — thank you so much to the hosts for sending a drawn out map of how to find the garage!!! AMAZING location of the apartment too. Definitely go to Pullman’s right around the corner if you stay here!!!","9"
"Honestly, if you haven’t booked this place already, do it now!!! Wow! We were blown away by the hospitality and cleanliness of their place. They were accommodating with our check in and out times to work with our flights. The apartment was easily accessible AND spotless. I mean seriously spotless. Not a single hair and speck on the floor. No dust. It was the cleanest air bnb I’ve ever stayed in. The location was perfect. Montreal is a super friendly and walkable city. I was communicated with within minutes every time I messaged. The bed is comfortable and living room welcoming. The balcony was a great touch to enjoy coffee in the morning. It’s also super simple to get up to. It’s the 8th floor and there is an elevator for your bags! Walking distance of a mile or so to pretty much everything you have to see. I’m already planning my trip back in the spring! Thank you again!!!!!!","9"
"Everything about the apartment was wonderful. We had a great stay!","9"
"Good values place in a great neighbourhood! Steph and Camilla were very helpful when I had a slight issue.","9"
"Good, economic choice in the neighbourhood. Quiet location and very responsive and helpful hosts. As can be expected in the area, the apartment is dated, however it as well as the furnishings were very clean and well maintained.","9"
"I am very pleased with the apartment. Very quiet and easy to find .. Great location in the center of Montreal near Mont Royal, spacious apartment with complete amenities and great communication as well. Highly recommended !Thank you Steph and Camilla !","9"
"Bien situé.  Conforme à la description.","9"
"Place is in a great location! Central to so many things. The hosts were lovely. Would only warn others that the space is a bit more dated than the photos online make it seem.","9"
"Great place to stay, short walking distance to both the metro and shopping locations nearby. Steph & Camilla were great to deal with. Would recommend staying here","9"
"Great value , clean nice apartment , exactly as I expected . Checked in late and Steph and Camilla were able to handle that with a lock box no problem . They left chocolates at check in which was a nice touch . Exactly what I expected, would definitely stay again .","9"

"I would recommend staying here 100%. Steph & Camilla are very quick to reply and are very gracious hosts. The place was warm and cozy, very lovely to step into after the freezing weather of Montreal in the winter time.","9"

"Mario’s loft was the perfect home-away from home for my first time in Montreal. It was well-kept, clean, and inviting with beautiful windows and thoughtful finishing touches throughout the space. Mario and his wife thought of everything and were always speedy to respond during my stay.

A few highlights: great neighborhood with everything you could need in walking distance, quiet neighbors, speedy wifi, jacuzzi tub with rainfall shower, stylish and modern, plush linens, fully equipped kitchen 

Would definitely come back again!","9"
"The place was beautiful the neighbours were nice. Host came and gave us a quick visit. Only minor issues; the toilet chain keeps falling. Overall great experience.","9"
"Loft incroyable et très grand, c’était super ! rien à dire","9"
"Great loft, lots of room and close to where I needed to be. Some good bar/resto's in the neighbourhood within walking distance. Only negative was the TV is antenna so not many options.","9"
"(Website hidden by Airbnb) Le logement est superbe. C'est spacieux et très bien équipé, tout est propre et Mario est un hôte sympathique et compréhensif.","9"
"Mario’s place is amazing. Very nicely decorated, not too much. Everything is super clean, which is the most important thing for me, but the place is fully equipped for everything that you need. They don’t have a laundry room but I did not need that. Super great location, close to the metro (even though I drove there), close good restaurants and bars. 

I had an amazing experience and would recommend Mario’s place.","9"
"I had the pleasure of staying here for 12 nights in a row. The loft is incredible and beautifully styled. You're literally 1 minute away from everything you need so the location could not be better. The loft is very spacious and looks even better in person! I would highly recommend you book this place for your stay. The communication with Mario was awesome and he was fantastic host. I look forward to staying here again in the future! Thanks Mario!","9"
"Le logement est très bien situé et c'est aussi un beau logement.","9"
"Not sure","9"
"very stylish place. lots of space. comfortable bed. kitchen is a bit understocked for cooking, but with plenty of restaurants and bars around that might not be an issue.","9"
"Great place","9"
"As native Montrealers, we appreciated that the loft had touches that were “very Montreal”; the outside of the building is more industrial, so it’s a fun surprise to walk into the impeccable loft that’s been beautifully re-designed. The space was previously a dance studio and we liked that they left the old mambo logo on the door and windows. 

The space is airy and vast. It feels great to be in, has big windows and lots of light. Parking was a breeze, kitchen was well equipped, bathroom modern and clean, and upstairs bedroom in the loft was cozy. You’re walking distance to some of Montreal’s best (St Viateur Bagels, Cafe Olympico, and tons of decent local bars). We came as a family and loved it. I think it works well for both families and people looking to go out and party. Mario was very helpful and getting the keys was easy too.","9"
"Wow, what a spot. This is an immaculate studio apartment in the mile end area within walking distance to all its streets right out the door. I enjoyed the high-tech TV that allowed me to screen cast my phone (it also has chromecast, but no actual television programming). Bed was wonderfully comfortable. I was only there for one night, and Tony arranged for someone to meet me to deliver the keys, who was hospitable. 

Parking is in a gravel parking lot, and when parked in front of the kindergarten I felt like it was a safer spot. In the morning there are many people who use the lot, so you're not the only one. 

Kitchen is stocked with only the essentials, which is all I needed. My only wish is that their jet-bathtub in the bathroom was fully functional. Otherwise this is an excellent and very comfortable location.","9"
"Great stay, place was clean and tidy. Close to shops, restaurants and bars. Host was easy to communicate with. Would definitely book again!","9"
"Mario has a great place.  It's well done, and in a great part of town for restaurants & going out.  The only negative is noise at night due to location on busy road, but otherwise all great.  & Mario is very communicative! ","9"
"The location and the facility were absolutely amazing!  Practically located, parking right next door, quiet for a very busy part of town, I can say nothing wrong about the place.  And the host was impeccable!","9"
"Place is OK. Feels Public. Not personal. Good location. Could be better furnished and decked out for this price.","9"
"First trip to Montreal, amazing place to stay close to everything and a very fun neighbourhood. A place you wont forget ","9"
"Mario’s loft is beautiful in person, great location, large, bright and airy. The loft was extremely clean and everything I needed as far as amenities was available. Would definitely stay again for my next visit to Montreal. ","9"
"I absolutely fell in love again with Montreal, with an old friend, and with Mario's place. I was so sad to leave! NO complaints really--beautiful wooden floors and floor to ceiling windows--great location in Mile End. It's a good 20 minute walk to old montreal, but I have been there done that, and if you want to go it's a 10 dollar cab ride. Mario's place was perfect! The bed was super comfy, the shower and tub were huge, the lighting in the place was gorgeous. Big kitchen, huge living room and TV area. OH! and I loved the floor length mirror off of the living room, which is fun to use for whatever self reflective purposes you find helpful. :)","9"
"Would be nice if there was more than just a huge comforter for the bed, it was hot and we just needed a sheet.","9"
"Amazing apartment with plenty of space for a group of people. Everything was clean and in order. In addition, the location is really close to about everything you would need.","9"
"L'appartement est spacieux, propre, et la localisation est parfaite!
Nous avons réservé à la dernière minute et je suis satisfaite de l'endroit. 
Il manque quelques instruments dans la cuisine (1 seul couteau à beurre) et le lavabo de la cuisine était bloqué.  Mario est disponible et facile à joindre, et il a tenté de réparer le lavabo, mais malheureusement il n'a pas pu le réparer avant notre départ. 
Il accepté que nous partions à 14h et ce sans frais, et ceci est très apprécié.
Globalement un bon choix!","9"
"Wow, where to start,? The place, the neighborhood, the care, the space, the tastes, the quick response, the coffee shops around, the smile when I wake up and go to sleep in this apartment - I definitely will come back, I definitely give 5 starts, and 5 stars more !!!! Wow!","9"
"Sink don’t work outside of that their pretty easy to get along with !","9"
"Good overall, but kitchen sink was broken.","9"
"huge space, good location, great stay","9"
"I see there was another review about the kitchen sink being broken. Wish I had seen that before I booked... I was advised when I arrived that the sink wasn’t working. There is a bucket under the sink which leaked all of the floor on my first day. The host told me there was nothing he could do about this and asked me to clean it myself.  I then tried to use the dishwasher to clean my dishes. It leaked a pool of water all over the floor. When I messaged the host for help, they brought me a mop and were angry that I used the dishwasher, stating that I was ruining someone’s boutique below their place. I cleaned the mess myself and had to do dishes in the bathtub for the rest of my weekend. The fridge also doesn’t close all the way so I had to briefly transfer things to the freezer to keep them cold and the TV was locked on someone else’s chrome cast for the entire stay. Definitely a non functional Airbnb until they repair the above issues and the host was rude/unhelpful with all of the things that weren’t working.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Mario’s loft is breathtaking, I felt like a celebrity. It is gigantic with great furniture, lighting, an aesthetics. I’ve never stayed anywhere nicer. The place was twice as big as I expected, and we spent about an hour after we got in talking about how lucky we were to have booked this place. The windows and ceiling are gigantic. The place is fairly centrally located close to all of the hip restaurants and bars in the Mile End area which is one of the coolest areas of Montreal. Mario was super accommodating and helpful. I arrived late in night and he was able to make arrangements for the keys.","9"
"Excelente estancia junto con Noemi y sus adorables pets (Dexter, Xena and Finn). Ambiente muy familiar, te hace sentir como en casa!. Noemi, siempre dispuesta a ayudar, te da sugerencias de los lugares mas populares o concurridos en Montreal. Excelente ubicación, a solo unos pasos del metro (5 min), y con muchisimas tiendas alrededor de donde esta ubicado.  Recomiendo este lugar, la compañia y el ambiente!. Asi que no duden en hospedarse aquí :)","9"
"great host. the house is close to the subway station.","9"
"Walkable to many local shops in Montreal. The bed is super comfortable and the hosts are very welcoming.","9"
"Veronique’s Place was great for me and my friend who I went to Montreal with. Her roommates were two guys, very helpful and friendly. We were out and about most of the time and we had a car to get around but the apartment is close to a bus stop if you need to use it. The only thing that I’m not sure was advertised is that there is smoking in the apartment - as long as that doesn’t bug you, great place! Also not far from downtown and close to bars and shops in the neighborhood.","9"
"La petite chambre est charmante et le lit est confortable. Cependant l'appartement est sale et peut sentir mauvais, il n'y a pas de rideaux à la fenêtre et on entend tout ce qui se passe dans le salon. L'hôte est gentille et l'appartement a un sacré potentiel, un coup de ménage plus régulier et ce serait vraiment bien selon moi. ","9"
"Room was nice. Comfy bed. Host was friendly but wasn’t there when we were checking in. No working sinks when we were there, but we didn’t spend a lot of time at the airBNB anyway. I don’t think that was information we we pre-warned about though. Very friendly little 3 legged kitty. Very convenient location if you wanna go to La Ronde for the day. Overall, not a bad time but definitely a few hiccups.","9"
"Sympathique appartement ensoleillé à proximité d’excellentes adresses.","10"
"Basic but spotless and comfortable apartment in an up-and-coming neighbourhood, with plenty of free street parking. Julie made our late check-in easy, messaged to make sure we got in OK, responded quickly to my one question, and was generally kind and pleasant. Airbnb at its best! (Too bad we didn't get to meet in person.)","10"
"Cet appartement est très confortable et donne sur un espace très agréable derrière avec balcon. Julie a été très sympathique, très compréhensive et nous a aidé pendant notre séjour. On la remercie également pour l’apéro. Je recommande vivement cet endroit ","10"
"The apartment looks exactly like the pictures: simple, clean and bright with everything one would need. Julie and her lovely family are wonderful hosts. They are so warm, accommodating and easygoing they make you feel as if you are staying with family. There are plenty of neighbourhood shops, restaurants and grocery stores in the area and the bus and metro are easily accessible. ","10"
"Julie was an amazing host. I stayed almost 3 weeks in her apartment (2nd floor), and would definitely return next time I am in Montreal and needing a place to stay. You could tell the place had been thoroughly cleaned before we arrived (my husband, my baby and I). The place had everything we asked for for the baby, and had all necessary amenities. She even go us a small appliance when we asked for it, and shared her kids toys with us for the baby to play with! She made sure we had enough soap and toilet paper. She was very welcoming, friendly and kind. I had a really great experience. Merci Julie et à la prochaine !","10"
"Julie's hospitality and natural charm are unrivaled, the space was everything you could ask for as well as being ridiculously clean and more spacious than the pictures show! Julie also offered many helpful tips on where to go and what to see as well as answering any questions we bad in a prompt and timely manner. I'd highly recommend this spot, you will not regret it! Thanks for an amazing time again, we hope to see you soon :) ","10"
"Very nice apartment about 15 minute Uber from old Montreal. Great local cafes by foot. Julie was a wonderful host!","10"
"L'appartement est bien situé, supermarché à côté. L'appart est très propre. Il est parfait pour une couple. Merci à Julie pour les boissons de bienvenue.","10"
"Superbe accueil de Julie! J'ai réservé l'appartement pour mes parents qui étaient en visite. Le quartier est génial (j'y habite!), le bus est à 1 min et le métro a 12 min à pieds.  Plein de commerces, restos, petits cafés, microbrasserie à quelques minutes + le Grand parc du père Marquette qui est très  agréable .
L'appartement est lumineux et très pratique, avec accès à 2 beaux balcons pour profiter du soleil.
Communication impeccable et hôtes tres réactifs. Je recommande!","10"

"Carolina was very accommodating, friendly, and helpful. There was a mistake with the keys and she kindly brought the right set of keys when we asked even though it wasn't an essential need. She gave us helpful parking tips as well. The location was excellent, there were two metro stations very close and many restaurants and shops. 
There were a few issues with the amenities of the place. There wasn't enough toilet paper there so we had to buy our own. There wasn't dish towels or paper towels which should be considered part of kitchen amenities. There is a few kitchen supplies but don't expect to cook a full meal there. The biggest issue was that the window in the bedroom wouldn't close all the way and there was a small crack that let in all the cold air. 
Overall it was a pleasant stay and we had lovely in Montreal.","9"
"Carolina's place is great, was able to just put down my things and get the much needed rest in the absolute peace and comfort her place provides. Many thanks!","9"
"There was a very strong odour in the place.

The window in the room doesn’t close which made it cold and loud in the morning.","9"

"It was a good place. Great location. Well kept and clean with bed linens, clean dishes and everything. The only thing that was troublesome for 5 adults was the shower which had pressure only 20% of the time and rest of the time, it just dripped, so we had to use the tap.","9"

"c’etait très bien la décoration etais parfait j’ai pas du tout été deçu a ce niveau , c’est plutôt l’air conditionné qui étais dérangeant car mes invités et moi avons eu de la misère a dormir il faisais terriblement froid , ce qui a rendu le séjour désagréable on aurait pu gravement tomber malade . Puis les lumières ne fonctionnaient pas ce qui m’as très deçu j’aurai juste voulu être informé a l’avance mais je crois qu’une fois qu’uil y aura des changements a cela , vous pourriez bien en profiter car l’apart est très beau et accueillant","9"

"Great apartment in Old Montreal. Really enjoyed our stay here!","9"
"exactly as expected, the location is fantastic","9"
"The few pictures on the web page does not do the apartment justice. The place is a lot larger than I have expected from the pictures, like a big one bedroom apartment. The location is fantastic, there is a Bixi bikeshare right by the entrance, a metro station across the street, and old montreal within walking distance.","9"
"We had a great time and would stay again if back in Montreal. I would highly recommend this place.","9"

"Honestly this is a tough review to write. 
Pros: 
1) The location was 11/10. 
2) Host was pretty responsive in terms of speed. 
3) Checking in was easy enough. 
4) Bathroom was fine and the shower/ water pressure was great. 
5) Wi-fi was fast and reliable.

Cons:
1) Carpeted areas of the apartment were soaked due to a flood (host knew about this and didn't warn us during our pre-check in communications on the day of arrival), carpet was black and mouldy looking (and in some areas, he had covered it with another rug which also soaked through). 
2) Apartment smelled increasingly damp/ mouldy/ musty over the 2.5 days we were there. Caused my roommate to sneeze throughout the night.
3) Communications with the host regarding the flooding situation became oddly defensive. I ended up having to placate him as he got very angry when I told him that the situation did not meet our expectations for the stay and to please look into the matter immediately (day 2/3)
4) Building entrance doors weren't ever locked. Anyone could walk in off the street - not sure if that's the norm in Montreal for rental/ primarily AirBNB buildings but as two women staying by ourselves, it made us uncomfortable. Not really the hosts' fault of course, but we should have been informed.
5) When he let himself and/or the building maintenance crew into the apartment to investigate (while we were out for the day), we returned several hours later to find that they had left the apartment unlocked. All our stuff was in the apartment, including my roommate's passport, laptop, jewelry, etc. This combined with the fact that the building has zero security at the entrance made us very uncomfortable and we felt it was very inappropriate that the host did not ensure that he locked the apartment door upon his leaving. It was sheer luck that no one thought to try to walk in and help themselves to anything. 
","9"
"Stéphane was extremely responsive and communicative.","9"
"The host was great at communicating and really quick in his responses. The apartment is located in a prime location and very well kept. Would definitely use again.","9"
"I loved this location!  So close to everything, safe neighborhood, lots of dining options.  Very walkable areas.  The place was clean and convenient.  Stephane was very accommodating as we had an arrival after midnight.  I would stay here again if I return to this beautiful and vibrant city.","9"
"This was a perfect place and location for us for our few days in Montreal.  While there were only 2 of us, it would have been very suitable for a small family.   Location was perfect.  Not right in the center of old town  to be overwhelming but just a couple blocks away to be very convenient.  It’s right around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica and about a block from the Metro.  We used all public transportation during our stay and it was very easy to earn the subway/bus lines.  The apt has everything you need for cooking, TV works fine with several cable channels and WiFi was good.  Our host was communicative and was accommodating with a request we made and we were thankful for that.  Highly recommend Tommy cafe up the street for coffee and breakfast.  They have a nice breakfast sandwich and avo toast with egg and really nicely made coffee!   ","9"
"Great location, perfect place for a Montreal getaway. Stéphane was very helpful.","9"
"Pretty Good!","9"
"What a spot!! After a simple miscommunication at check in my girlfriend and I were inside the best value Apartment space in Old Montreal! Everything was clean, assessable and secure inside the building. Parking was easy enough. And... you cannot beat the location. Walking distance to Old Montreal, the Old Port, St Catherine’s and Crescent St restaurants downtown! Highly recommend.","9"

"Great apartment.  Excellent location.","9"
"This location is the perfect center spot within a radius that is central to almost everything (even local transit). The apartment is well furnished and very private. 

The communication from the host was spectacular and questions where answered almost instantly. 

I would highly recommend.  This is now my preferred spot when booking a trip to Old Montreal. 

Also, the parking does cost extra. However the location gives you a peace of mind, since it is connected below the building and not remotely.","9"
"Great experience. The apartment is in an excellent location, close to downtown, St. Laurent, Chinatown, Old Port and very close to the metro so easy to get around the city. The apartment itself was very clean and accurately represented by the photos. Check in/out was easy and the place had everything we needed. We would definitely stay again.","9"
"Stephane’s place is in a great location. It is about a 5 min walk to the Basilica de Notre Dame and the metro is right across. The communication was great and Stephane replied right away to our queries. The place is perfect for a couple or maybe three people at the most. Thanks for hosting us Stephane.","9"
"Spacious apartment at an extremely convenient location.  It is within short walking distance to Notre Dame and many great restaurants in old Montreal.","9"
"Wonderful place to stay and great location. Stephanie was very helpful","9"
"Nice place, great location, very secure. TV volume is low so you can't hear it when the heat is on or the shower but everything else was good. 
Good for the price.","9"
"The apartment was comfortable and in a very central position which was very convenient for my short stay. I would recommend this place to anyone.","9"
"The apartment itself was comfortable and the heating worked well. There is a tiny television but you shouldn’t be watching TV anyway right? For those who are going to use the indoor parking, it would be wise to park at the end of the 15 min parking for the embassy suites because you will have to go up to the apt to get the parking pass and drive around one way streets to get to the parking garage. If you park at the 15 min zone, you can probably just back up 10 ft to get to the garage. There is an entrance to the indoor connected montreal across the street and you can walk all the way to the eaton centre in about 25 minutes or the place des artes in about 15 minutes. Just be sure to map it out beforehand.","9"

We really like it. A nice place.","9"
"Les sugiero tomar fotos de alojamiento entero antes de salir porque en mi caso el anfitrión me cobro una lámpara que yo nunca vi y que no aparece en el anuncio. Por favor, tengan cuidado para evitar malos entendidos que les generen repercusiones económicas.","9"

"Ce condo est parfaitement bien situé entre la vieille ville, le port et downtown. Très propre, facile d'accès. J'ai beaucoup aimé mon séjour à Montréal :)","9"
"Great location. Central to everything. Overall, the unit is clean and fairly spacious. The bed feels like its gotten a lot of use and is hard. The ""second bed""/Fouton feels like its ready to break at any moment. I only sat on the second bed but overall, it was a great location and a decent unit. I'd def stay here again for a quick weekend trip.","9"
"Many thanks to Constantin for hosting us.
The place is beautiful and very centrally located at the Plateau.
They had all the baby stuff that we needed and even more which was amazing.
Communication was great before and during our visit despite the fact that they were out of town.
Many thanks!","10"
"I rented this place for my family who came from Russia for my cousin's wedding. We had 13 of us stay here and it was undeniably the best experience. I live in Montreal and have been to many places and this place by far was the most unbelievably gorgeous. So well designed. The location of the penthouse is steps away from everything in old port Montreal, from stores to restaurants, clubs and bars. We had an incredible water front view of the old port as well. If I could give this place a 10 star I would! Thank you from my family, my cousin and I!!!","10"
"Penthouse was great! Stayed over with a couple friends. Location was right on the pier Central to everything. The place is huge, well designed and stylish. The host even showed me around for a night! I would stay here again.","10"
"This place was beautiful, exquisite, and it's in a perfect location. I don't think I could have picked a better place to stay in during my time in Montreal. I stayed here for my brother's bachelor party and it exceeded all of my expectations with a group of 16. Our host was incredibly gracious and accommodating for all of our needs. He also was more than helpful to give recommendations and even accompanied us to get all the necessities we would need during our stay. He even came out with us our first night and made us feel right at home. This place and the host really made my brother's bachelor party an incredible one and I don't think I'll ever forget that.

"Two separate units, plenty of space for 13 people to sleep in. Two really cool apartments with unique / interesting decor. Location is perfect for exploring Old Montreal and the hosts were helpful in suggesting places to go out to.","10"
"A welcome surprise when we walked into the apartment. It felt better than the photos. Located in a very historic and walkable area. Lots of buzz & shops. Milo was an incredible host and made sure we were happy at every turn. We had to switch apartments due to a plumbing accident. Milo walked us through every step to upgrade us to another place which we equally loved. Great hospitality.","8"
"The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","8"
"Milo had great communication, his place was very nice. The only problem was as we arrived the guest ahead of us broke the shower. He gave us a very small partial refund, but we were forced to shower in a public area. The shower had no water pressure and mold everywhere. Although this might not have been his fault, we thought the issue should have been resolved during our stay since we complied with everything he needed and gave him all the information on the shower in a prompt fashion.","8"
"The shower in the unit prior to be entering the unit. The host (Milo) notified me prior to my arrival of this and stated that it would be fixed by the next day. He instructed me to bathe myself with hot water. The next day he brought 2 buckets to bathe with and messaged me to state that the plumber has ordered the part and it should be arriving within the next few days and the shower should be fixed by the weekend (I had booked a 2week stay and for one week I would be without a shower). I was not ok with this arrangement and requested a different possible resolution. He then directed me to go to the roof, access the swimming pool take a shower there and then come back to the unit. I informed the host that this was not ok to which he replied ""well there is working bath and hot water so what's the issue"".  I politely requested to be relocated if he had another unit or simply a refund of my money so I could find another unit. Milo did not agree that this was a good idea and took it up on himself to threaten me that his ad never stated that he had a shower and that if I left the unit I would be cancelling my stay and there wouldn't be a refund. Long story short after many hours of attempting to politely reason with Milo I finally contacted Airbnb support and requested their assistance. They also agreed that this was not a good condition for anyone to remain in (no shower and bathing with buckets) and assisted in obtaining my full refund. The host was NOT a nice person nor was he polite or understanding or even cared about the request or the well being of the guest or the condition which he was leaving me in by asking me to bathe with buckets. He did not care about having misinformed his guest and only wanted the money from the booking. I've booked with many individuals using Airbnb however never experienced anything of this caliber. Good luck to you all who book with him","8"
"Go place to stay","8"
"Book this apartment!!!!
We loved this beautiful home for many reasons-location-it is steps away from the basilica, great restaurants and all the old town action. Downtown Montreal is very close, so it is easy to walk everywhere. The house was very clean, the bed was roomy and comfortable, the shower and large soaking tub were great and Milo is the best host ever!!!  He even sent me an encouraging email when he found out about my illness. Above and beyond!!! Thanks, Milo, for the coffee assortment and the tea. We had an awesome time, stay here!!!","8"
"Le séjour chez Anne-Laure s'est bien déroulé .
Appartement spacieux avec jardin bien situé mais ménage pas fait à l'arrivée et voisine du dessus très bruyante. Dommage que nous n'ayons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer l'hôte bien que nous avons apprécié le service d'un membre de la famille. ","8"

"Julia Et Philly’s place was amazing. We were so grateful that they let us check in with one hours notice as our other Airbnb was such a mess, they were lovely and helped us so much. We are so grateful they really saved our trip. Would book this place over and over again!","9"

"It was our first time visiting Montreal & are so glad we stayed in this place! Very close to the old town, metro, gorcery store & restaurants, it's also right next to chinatown. The place itself was spacious, clean & had everything we needed! it had a gym too!  thank you so much for hosting us!","9"
"Very accommodating! The origins parking spot is too short for my minivan and they assign me immediately to another larger parking spot! I need second sets of key for convenience and they provide me as well and waive the deposit charge! I will come back again for sure!!!","9"
"Clean apartment with nice features! Also very convenient location right near Chinatown and the convention center downtown.","9"
"Fantastic hospitality and great communication! This was our first time booking an airbnb, so I did have several questions and Julia was very quick to respond and put our minds at ease. The location was fantastic as we had friends staying at a near by hotel (except they paid triple for their stay). Julia Et Philly's place was clean and spacious (comfortably slept 4 adults). Would recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in downtown Montreal. Thank you Julia et Philly!","9"
"We had a great time! The apartment was beautiful and super clean, but most importantly had a fantastic location!! Julie was super helpful and made the check in and check out process very simple! Would definitely recommend this place! :)","9"
"The location is great.  The apartment is clean and the layout is good.  However there is pumping issue in the kitchen sink.  The dirty water stuck in the sink and caused the whole apartment stinks.  The offensive lingering odour made us felt uncomfortable for the whole night.  If this issue is fixed, then it is a good place to stay.","9"
"Was in Montreal for trade show, location could not have been more convenient (across from Palais de Congress), check was a breeze, even though our flight was delay 3 hrs and arrived late, the line of communication were kept open.
Great restaurants with walking location, centrally located for wither drive or walk.  Secure and clean surroundings.
Hosts were responsive and accommodating","9"
"Thanks Julia for being a great host.  Perfect condo in a perfect spot!  Everything is just in walkable distance.","9"
"A very nice place to stay! Location was perfect!","9"
"Great Apartment, walking distance from Old Town Montreal and right by the train station! Great communication!","9"
"Les hôtes ont été très acceuillant, endroit très propre et calme. Rien de négatif à dire.","9"
"Overall this place was great, and the hosts were quick to respond to all the requests. The location was excellent,  we were about a 5 minute walk to the Notre Dame Basilica. The building is clean, and quiet. We had access to the gym which we used. The parking space was a bit small, and uncomfortable, but we were glad to have it. The only almost catastrophic thing that happened was that when we got there 2 beds were missing which were advertised in the  original post. We contacted Julia and Philly right away, and they said that they could drop one off the following day and that the 2 sofa beds could fit 2 people each, so we should have enough room. That would have been horrible and uncomfortable for all of us considering we had a 6+ feet tall guy who barely fit by himself on the sofa bed, and couldn’t share the  queen size bed in the bedroom. In the end it all worked out because one of our coworkers did not come. ","9"
"Great place to be if you want to stay downtown. The bedroom is bigger than it looks in the pics.","9"
"Super emplacement beau complexe avec piscine sur le toit chauffée, Julia vraiment gentille et prête à vous accommoder merci beaucoup","9"
"Loved this place!  Great location, very clean (bedding smelled amazing) and stylish space.  It had everything and more than needed for a one night stay.  Check in was a breeze!","9"
"Three of us were here for the F1 weekend. Condo is in a great location for old town, St Laurent, Crescent St and lots more. Pool and steam room are a nice addition to help dust off the morning cobwebs. Good communication and no hassles!","9"
".","9"
"Unfortunately Airbnb gave us the incorrect address.  Also we specifically picked this Airbnb for the parking, but the listing didn't mention the low ceiling and that large SUV-sized vehicles would not fit.  We had to pay to park elsewhere, and when we tried to find the address, we waited about 40 min before resolving the actual address with Julia.  Julia was extremely attentive to our needs and came as soon as she could to guide us to the actual address that matched the photo listing.  Also, this property was in an ideal location to explore Old Montreal.","9"
"Great place great value!!","9"
"Don't stay here, unsafe, unclean and classic bait and switch. They'll offer you a larger unit, for a price.","9"
"Bel emplacement propreté impeccable","9"
"The hosts were accomodating, which was much appreciated. The location was excellent, very close to the old port. I had booked it for my parents (seniors) and the location was perfect for them to get to everywhere they needed to go. ","9"
"This was only our 2nd Air BnB experience and we loved the location for our family of 4 to tour both Old Montreal and downtown by foot or transit.

The condo was clean, had available parking, adequate space for a family of 4, a nice view, was walking distance to a grocery store, and we felt totally safe walking in this area at all times of the day as well. 

If we ever came back to Montreal we would look to stay here again.

","9"
"The location of the condo was perfect!! As for finding the condo was difficult, especially the parking. Thankfully Julia was quick to respond and gave us further directions. The space itself appeared to be quite different to the pictures, although was still nice. The space was unclean in the bathroom (toilet and sink) and kitchen (lipstick found on glasses). As for the sleeping arrangements the space comfortably would fit 4 adults. The beds however were terribly uncomfortable. ","9"
"The space is awesome for a 1 bedroom, but cannot comfortably fit 6 adults. It was a good experience for the short stay we had since we didn't spend a lot of time inside the apartment. The location is awesome, right in the heart of Old Port and close to the metro. The location was a bit confusing at first because the listing said one place but our final confirmation listed another. 

For the 888 Rue Saint-François-Xavier, there is no access code to the building, it is free to enter, any floor. 

There are 3 levels of parking which is good and an adequate gym. 

Julia was great with communication, she also brought us more pillows and towels when requested. ","9"
"Perfect location! Right in Old Montreal just steps away from great restaurants and attractions.  The accommodations were very nice and even included a washer/dryer.  Parking was included which was important for us.  Would not hesitate to stay here again.","9"
"Stylish place right in Old Montreal! It's listed as sleeping six people, but the two fold-out couches we're only the size of a twin bed. It might be a but if a tight fit to actually sleep two people on each couch. Other than that, great place!","9"
"Location was amazing. Parking process a little cumbersome and stressful (we had to go upstairs to get the parking pass before parking and same process to leave and fitting our large car very stressful!) The host did not respond to any of my messages during the stay. Beds super hard and unconfortable. The location was perfect for exploring.","9"
"Great place. Cannot beat the area . Julia et Philly offered quick communication, easy accessibility and answered all my questions. We had everything provided . Place seems a little smaller then the photos showed but still was more than comfortable and roomy. And the location- amazing!!!!","9"
"Excellent host, great position, amazing house","9"
"L’appartement que nous avons eu n’est pas celui que nous avons réservé. Sur le site à la réservation c’est un autre appartement qui doit être dans le même immeuble.
Celui que nous avons eu et très décevant et en plus nous avons eu le sentiment de nous être fait arnaquer.","9"
"The location of Julia’s apartment was fantastic for exploring Montréal. It was a bit tricky leaving the car to go up to the apartment on the 19th floor to get the parking pass before parking. Also having to do the same in reverse once leaving the underground parking. We were a group of 4. The main bedroom was comfortable but the 2 sofa beds in the lounge were only just adequate for 2 adults. If we were a group of 6 the sleeping arrangements wouldn’t have worked.","9"
"Bien pour un couple seul...","9"
"Great location! Middle of old Montreal near all the major hotels are.  Minutes away from Saint Catherine Street, Chinatown, CoucheTard, and the Place D'Arms metro station.  Great garage parking facility, tight turns for big cars/suv's but all navigable.  As with most of Montreal, alot of one way streets and the busy street can make your drive there a bit more fun (timely).  

The photos shown in the listing are NOT the same unit.  The furniture, finishes, and decorations are similar, but the physical room is not the one as shown.  Not a huge issue as the actual unit was quite sizeable and the layout didn't impose.  Just to note, the listing indicates for 6 guests.  At most it could comfortably sleep 4 adults.  Two in the queen bed and 1 in each of the two sofa beds.  So just beware of that if you have a larger group.  Also the sofa beds were quite firm/hard, like sleeping on a camping foam matress.","9"
"The worst communication with owner of the apartment. Apartment doesn’t corespondent with the pictures at all.","9"
"Very nice apartment in busy china town. Host was very prompt with responses. My one issue was that I believe photos are of multiple apartments & are misleading. It is way too small for six people as advertised & realistically would be awkward for more than one couple. Would be a great place for a couple perhaps with children.","9"
"Logement très bien situé dans une résidence hôtelière. Pas de contact avec les gérants. Tout se fait par (Website hidden by Airbnb) et efficace, mais un peu froid au final.","9"

"I loved staying here! It was very quiet at night, even on a Friday night when there was a street festival, and yet you are right in the heart of a great neighborhood! I got in a run to the Mount Royal park, I ate so much food at on Saint Laurent, and there was a funky park right around the corner hosting great local bands for Fringe Fest! I'd definitely stay here again!","9"

"Great place, great location, great responsiveness of the host. I would recommend the place when you’re in Montreal!","9"
"If you are staying in the Plateau, I found this very central studio to be worth splurging a bit. I have stayed twice with this wonderful host and I had fun activities both times right in the neighborhood. There is lots of attention to detail in her studios with pretty decor and kitchen appliances, and coffee and tea provided. It really suited my needs for both a 2 week stay and a quick overnight on a separate occasion. Really welcoming vibe from host and almost always quick replies to messages. Thank you so much Alexia!","9"
"Alexia’s apartments never disappoint. We’ve stayed in the building four times in less than a year. The apartments are clean and have everything we need. We’re looking forward to going again soon. Thanks Alexia!","9"

"Alexia est une hôte adorable, très réactive et très serviable. Elle a gardé ma valise chez elle pour me permettre de profiter de mon dernier jour à Montréal. La communication est facile et efficace ! Une très bonne hôte ! 
L'appartement est néanmoins assez mal isolé du bruit (bonne isolation thermique en revanche) et le frigo est bruyant. Il faut prendre des bouchons d'oreille pour un séjour un peu long. 
Très bon emplacement !","9"
"Very nice studio in a great neighborhood.  Everything you may need and much more was provided","9"
"Alexia is an amazing host, the apartment has everything you could ask for and the location is ideal. Montreal is an amazing city and everything is easily accessible from this location. I will book again with her in the very near future! The best part was that this apartment was sparkling clean, animal and smoke free, something that was a must for my as I have allergies.

Alexia went out of her way to communicate with me and allow an early check in. She held my bag in her own apartment at check out so that I could hang out in the city until my later flight and even put the bag in her cabinet so that her adorable kitty Igor could not get hairs on it as I am allergic.

In the apartment there was coffee and tea for guests to enjoy. She has a helpful booklet of how everything works and what is nice in the neighborhood to explore. She provides hand knitted slippers for guests to wear! The apartment is perfect for one person or a couple with plenty of towels, a hair dryer, extra blankets, a tub for soaking and a full kitchen. There is even a balcony and if it wasn't November and freezing outside I would have taken Alexia up on having my tea out there! 

The apartment is a few blocks away from the most incredible park, Mount Royal, and even though it was chilly I went in to walk in the woods everyday. The charming Plateau and Mile End neighborhoods are also right outside the door. It is a quick walk to downtown or a practically instant bus ride on the 55. I particularly enjoyed a gluten free bakery called Boulangerie Baked2Go Allergen Free, the adorable Edmond cafe canteen, and a health food store all within a couple of blocks. Lots of vintage shops on the main drag close by, St Laurent. It was a ten minute walk to Parc La Fontaine and the best poutine that was also able to be gluten free at a super cute cafe La Banquise. This was my first trip to Montreal and I could not have asked for a better host or apartment. I felt like a native coming home to the charming plant filled foyer. What a wonderful city!

I had such a great trip visiting the Manifesto exhibit at MAC, a film festival was going on and I was able to catch a French language movie,  I got a new tattoo at the close by at Minuit Dix Tattoo from outstanding artist Charline Bataille and bought a hand made winter coat at the incredible Kanuk store down the road that had a 50% off sale. A magical first trip thanks to Alexia's charming apartment and it's wonderful location!","9"

"Rien à dire, c’était parfait !","9"
"Alexia was very helpful in every way, she was very pleasant and the apartment was warm and cozy! It was the perfect location, being in walking distance of many things but still nice and quiet. We’ll be staying here again next time we visit Montreal.","9"
"We enjoyed our stay at Alexia’s place. We lucked out and found parking right outside, which was a huge relief and found a great coffee shop just around the corner. The apartment was very clean, warm and and in a great location!","9"
"Bonne situation, appartement très propre et tout l'équipement necessaire pour un séjour de courte ou longue durée.","9"
"The space is as much as one or two travellers need. Very good value. There are kitchen utensils (pots and pans) as well at cutlery, so you can cook your own food if you prefer. There are also a lot of great places to eat near by and a lot of fun things to do","9"

"Yanick's place is perfect if you want to experience the heart of Old Montreal! The apartment is quiet and cozy, and the bed was super comfy. I appreciated the breakfast goodies, too! I've stayed at quite a few AirB&Bs in Montreal, and this is definitely one of my favourites, especially for the price.  I would love to stay here again. ","10"

"Great location. Nice host. If you hate the perfume smell of fabric softener, don’t stay here unless the owner changes his laundry procedures. Good value. ","10"
"This quiet, cozy apartment is in the very best location of Old Montreal. Walk to restaurants, entertainment, the Old Port and shopping. Very safe neighborhood, which was important since I travelled alone. The loft was well maintained and very clean. Nice shower with ample hot water, plenty of towels, air conditioned, comfy bed. I usually don't sleep well when traveling, but I had to problem here. Two sunny windows added to the charm. There is an elevator in the building so it was easy for me to get up and down with luggage. Check in and out was very easy and the building is secured at night. Yanick was a great host and made sure there was coffee, fresh fruit, plenty of bottled water and some nice breakfast items. I can't wait to come back to this charming loft! ","10"
"A wonderful space truly in the heart of Old Port! Best location in Montreal!","10"
"Amazing location. We were travelling with a baby so we can truly attest to the ease of our stay. Surpassed all expectations.","10"
"We enjoyed our stay one of the reason was location. We loved the Old City and the place we stayed is in the heart of Old City. There can't be better location then this.","10"
"Amazing location to visit the Old Port. The place is located around lots of restaurants where you can go get food. 

It’s also located near to a metro station which makes it super easy to move all around the city. 

The whole place is nice and cozy. ","10"
"Unbeatable location on bustling rue Saint-Paul. Breakfast food in the fridge was a very nice touch and it was an easy check-in/check-out process.","10"
"Any incredible location close to everything in Old Montreal. This was a comfortable, well stocked space to return to each day. There is strict timing around check in so ensure you create travel plans to accommodate. Yanick is approachable and attentive. This is a wonderful listing. ","10"

"What can I say... Location, location, location. In the middle of everything in Old Montréal. Convenient, quiet and cozy. Lots of great restaurants around. Communication with Yanick was super easy, same with key exchange. He even made sure there were things available for breakfast. That's a super host. I will not hesitate to reserve again.","10"
"Un emplacement idéal pour découvrir la meilleure partie de Montréal (le vieux Montréal). La rue dans laquelle se trouve le Airbnb est juste superbe. Yanick est un hôte très attentionné qui nous a laissé des rafraîchissements et tout ce qu'il faut pour se faire le petit déjeuner... Idem pour l'hygiène, nous avons trouvé du shampooing et gel douche bio à la lavande. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour.","10"
"You will not be disappointed! Perfect space and location! Loved that we could make lattes every morning thanks to Yanick having a frother and nespresso machine! Bunk  beds were comfortable, food in the fridge and cupboards are a nice touch. Was very clean and smelt wonderful!","10"

"Yanick was great! Wonderful central location so much to see and walk to... close to so many restaurants. Locals were welcoming! Space was perfect for my needs, breakfast included helped so much on the first few days and space was very well done and well kept. Bunk beds were both comfortable.  Would definitely book the space for the future!","10"
"Yanick's loft was perfect for my short trip to Montreal. The space was comfortable and the location perfect for exploring the city. Highly recommend!","10"
"Located on the oldest street in the city of Montreal, in Old Montreal by the port, this cozy loft with double bunk beds is just steps away from restaurants and shops.  YanickProvided basic snacks and breakfast foods, and the loft was just perfect. It’s a fabulous place to stay! A 20 minute walk from downtown Montreal, and just a few minutes from the walk along the river. Great place.","10"
"The location is nice, inside the old Montreal. It's a 9-minute walk from the nearest subway station on a hill street, which isn't easy when you're with luggage, so I suggest using a taxi, uber or something on arrival and departure.

The place is really good, with some food in the fridge. 

We had a really great time in there and I do recommend it.","10"
"Amazing in every respect!  We will never forget our AMAZING experience staying in such a perfect location in a fabulous apartment where the host has thought of EVERYTHING++++
You miss out on this opportunity & it is truly your loss!","10"

"Logement de qualité, en accord avec les descriptions, accueil parfait et le logement est très bien placé","10"
"it is such a great location","10"
"Perfect location in the heart of old Montreal, easy check-in process and responsive host. Unfortunately the power and Wi-Fi were gone for the last few hours of my stay, possibly due to work that was being done on the street outside, but I know that would have been outside the host's control. Would definitely recommend this place though.","10"
"A++++","10"
"Yanick’s space is exactly as described. Few steps to the old port and amazing pubs / restaurants, and minutes away from the subway. Yanick made sure I had everything I needed; very responsive, and   kept on communicating with me even after my later check-in. Sparkling clean apartment.","10"

"Christopher's place is beautiful, very bright with lots of natural light, seemed recently renovated with some retro touches. The location is perfect, such a great neighbourhood with lots of cafés, restaurants and shops within walking distance. The market is wonderful, too, and so close! Patio is epic, but you do need to go up a fire escape to get to it, so if heights aren't your favourite, that's a little intense. WiFi signal's not very strong on the ground floor, we couldn't get Netflix to work. And it was my first time interacting with a third-party for check-in and questions: check-in and -out were seamless, but a homeowner's familiarity with the neighbourhood and house were missing. Still, it's a great place for a really reasonable price, I'd absolutely recommend.","10"
"Perfect place in a great neighborhood. Clean, cute, narrow two-story building. I loved it.","10"
"L'endroit est super... Ce sera mon 1er choix lorsque retournerai à Montréal. J'ai adoré le quartier et les cafés, dépanneur, boulangerie ainsi que Marché Jean-Talon, le prix est parfait pas trop élevé et pas trop bas... C'est un ""keeper""... Christopher est très réactif et coopératif, wow merci ! Belle terrasse aussi. Métro 5-7 min à  pied et stionnements très accessibles ds les rues avoisinantes l'unité.","10"
"Parfait location pour cette jolie maison la terrasse est parfaite !","10"
"Great location, close to Marche Jean Talon, parks, metro and restaurants. Great family friendly neighborhood. Clean, well laid out apartment with beautiful roof top deck.","10"
"Christopher's place is one of the best Airbnb's I've ever stayed in. It is spacious, well-lit, and amazingly clean. The location is perfect, only a few blocks from the subway to the downtown. We got the 3-day unlimited metro passes which work on the bus and subway, which worked out really well for us. The home is only a few blocks from the Jean Talon Farmer's Market, the largest farmer's market in North America. The kitchen in the home is full of everything you would need to cook for dinner. There is even a rooftop terrace for dining. So many great things. The one drawback is that the listing says there is air conditioning and it worked so poorly, I don't think you should count on that. It was very hot in Montreal the weekend we went and we just couldn't get the house cool with the air conditioner. Other than that, everything was great and I highly recommend this home!","10"
"L’appartement est très bien équipé et surtout la terrasse sur le toit est magnifique! Nous en avons beaucoup profité! Le marché Jean-Talon est à distance de marche, on en profite aussi, c’est super. La maison est sur un coin de rue alors ce peu être un peu bruyant la nuit, mais les fenêtres fermées, on n’entend rien, c’est bien isolé :)","10"
"Très bon accueil, très professionnel, par la personne de l'agence et le départ a été facilité.
La maison  convenait parfaitement à noter attente dans un quartier sympathique plein de commerces et de vie. (très Montréalais) Boulangerie très proche et supermarché ouvert jusqu'à 22H00 nous ont bien rendu service.","10"
"L'appartement est très fonctionnel, confortable, propre et agréable. Il est idéalement localisé (quartier agréable proche marché Jean Talon, metros ...). 
Seul leger bémol (et cela dépendra des points de vues), il s'agit d'un appartement a priori réservé à de la location donc un peu impersonnel (n'a pas le charme et le caractère vivant d'un appartement  habité).","10"
"Amazing location. Very clean place. The rooftop patio is awesome","10"
"Notre séjour s'est très bien passé dans cette maison très calme et très confortable avec tout le nécessaire, dans un quartier agréable. Autre point positif elle est très proche du marché Jean Talon, nous y sommes allés tous les jours , et du parc Jarry.  ","10"
"The place lived up to the descriptions provided, and my expectations. It was clean, well appointed, and had lots of room, spaces, closets, etc. to unpack and get comfortable. Great location near Jean Talon market, and the amenities, service, and key exchange went very smoothly.","10"
"Christopher's house was perfect : super clean, perfect location (we spent our days at Café Larue, Le Pain dans les Voiles, Marché Jean-Talon and at the Parc Jarry - all within 5 min. walk), communication was flawless and the rooftop terrace was a very nice plus. I would go back in a hearbeat. Highly recommended!","10"
"Christopher’s place was the best choice we could have made. The house was very cute,artistic, super clean and organised and had everything you might need.Christopher had thought of every detail for eg. extra pillows of different quality, and supplies for the house needs.  The house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood with a mini store accross the street and two metro stations in a walking distance. It is perfect especially for longer duration stays like ours. I would totally recommend it to everyone. It can really make you feel like a local in Montreal! Thank you Christopher for your hospitality!","10"
"This house in Villeray is as clean, spacious and charming as it looks! We stayed for seven weeks and fell in love with the space and the neighbourhood. Christopher is super prompt with responding to any questions and the check-in and check-outs were both smooth. The proximity to metro stations, Jean Talon Market, Little Italy and so many amazing cafes, coffee shops, bakeries and restaurants make Christopher's place an ideal base for your Montreal trip.","10"

"great apartment downtown Montreal. 
next door is bell centre, don't miss to see a hockey game. public transport in 1minute distance, many places for breakfast or dinner and shopping as well as sightseeing in walking distance.
Mario and Michaela are very friendly and helped to make it great three days in Montreal.","9"
"Imagine swimming in an indoor pool in the sky while its snowing outside. Pretty epic. Apartment itself had all modern fixtures and conveniences, but no microwave or toaster oven. Futon couch is probably great for travelers intending  to use it as an additional bed, but as a couch it leaves a bit to be desired. Also, TV has no cable or other service (not even OTA coverage), so bring an hdmi cable to plug in your computer. Amazing location, super close to many bars and restaurants and convenient to many points of interest.","9"
"Perfect communication, very nice and perfect condition of the apartment. Highly recommanded. Super location and the parking is a big plus","9"
"Being at Esrher’s place has been awesome. Esther is an outstanding person. She made me feel like at home. 
The place is beautiful, furnished with a lot of style...I love it!
Bedsheets and mattress were clean and fresh, same than the bathroom.
Probably what I like most was the location, 2 minutes walking from Parc Jean Mance (where people play the drums on Sunday) and to the best restaurants in Plateau!
I’ll be back!!","10"
"As usual, Esther treated outstandingly. He encouraged me to visit and discover the real Montreal, with valuable tips. Summer is awesome here! I didn't wanna leave!
Thanks for everything, Esther. I'll be back soon, and for sure, I'll be back in your place!

hosts need a bit more airbnb experience before I can highly recommend.","10"
"Sajjad's an amazing host . He gave me great tips and he was always  communicating to see if everything was good  (not every day, just the right amount of times) . The place is strategically placed, It has a pool and a gym which is great and all the services you need. You just need to take in consideration that the bed has no base (as indicated in the page) and the couches are kind of old. If you don't mind about these things then this place is an amazing place to  stay. For me it was amazing, you have below the building a mall (with everything yo need) and a quick access to the metro station.
I would with no doubt return to this place.","8"

Jason himself was very thoughtful & hospitable, promptly providing info on the apartment and made sure we felt at home.  I would highly recommend staying here during your visit to Montreal! ","10"
"Très belle expérience du début jusqu’à la fin. Echanges et communication faciles et rapides, check in et check out simples et souples, superbe appartement propre, ensoleillé et décoré avec goût, terrasse magnifique offrant une belle vue, suffisamment d’espace pour ranger ses propres affaires et se sentir « comme à la maison », équipement fonctionnel et complet (ou s’il manque quelque chose (comme un sèche cheveux dans notre cas), le très sympathique et attentionné Jason vous l’apportera dans les heures qui suivent), quartier très bien desservi par les transports en commun et animé (ce qui n’empêche pas de bénéficier d’un calme appréciable dans l’appartement), etc.

S’il fallait vraiment formuler une critique, peut-être pourrait-on suggérer l’installation d’enceintes pour écouter sa propre musique ? C’est vraiment tout…

En bref : à essayer de toute urgence, même si vous habitez Montréal et que vous avez envie de vous faire un weekend dans un lieu sympa ! Mon ami et moi reviendrons à Montréal et nous n’irons pas chercher ailleurs. Nous avons déjà recommandé l’endroit à quelques amis.","10"

"Jason was very nice, easy to communicate with and responsive. His apartment is an amazing place to stay. Everything is new, modern & clean. The deck is absolutely stunning with a gorgeous view & a vegetable garden. We ate tomatoes from it! The kitchen is stocked with lots of things you'd need to cook. Although the place is conveniently-located just off St. Laurent, it's quiet. The bed is new & very comfortable & the shower is really nice. Just across the street is one of the best cafes in the city, Cafe Sardine, which at night turns into a restaurant (same chef as at Toronto's Guu). Walking distance to more great restaurants, grocery & organic food stores, a pharmacy & lots of shopping. If Jason's apartment is available to rent, it'd be a good idea to snap it up! There aren't many places like this to rent in Montreal & in the best neighbourhood.","10"

"A smooth and relaxing stay! I hope this apartment is available next time I'm in Montreal! The apartment was clean, bright and modern and the roof top terrace was a huge bonus.

The neighbourhood is my favouite in Montreal with many of the best new restaurants and brunch spots within a short walk. Lots of boutique shopping and close to a deppaneur and grocery store. ","10"
"The company I work for had booked this AirBnB for me. I had never been to one before and I did not really know what to expect. I 
was happily surprised to find the standard of a good hotel, with shampoo, shower gel, body lotion and fresh towels readily available. 
The apartment looks modern, was very clean and is located near lots of restaurants and bars on St. Laurent. 
The roof top terrace is absolutely gorgeous with a view on Mont Royal. Key exchange was uncomplicated and Jason was very friendly
and patiently answered all of my questions.  I can totally recommend this AirBnB and look forward to staying there again - and now maybe also in other AirBnBs because of the 
positive experience.","10"
"We really loved our stay at the Fairmount flat. Walking distance to iconic food destinations like Fairmount bagel, Schwartz's Delicatessen, Wilensky and more, about a 5-7 min. walk to the metro. We visited during extremely hot weather so we were glad to have this place to come back to and relax during the day to recharge -- the AC helped a ton. The flat and kitchen is impeccably stocked with any tools and things you might need -- we chose to grill some of our meals with the awesome Weber grill on the roof deck.

I was also very impressed by the cleanliness and presentation of the flat overall. Thank you, Jason!","10"
"The listing was exactly as pictured (with the exception of the balcony, which is even better than pictured, with an amazing seating area!). 
My husband and I had a great stay in our favourite neighborhood in Montreal, full of interesting stores, cafes and restaurants. One of the best restaurants I've tried in Montreal, Hotel Herman, was just steps away. 
Jason was a great host and made the check-in and check-out process clear and easy. I'd highly recommend this apartment for a trip to Montreal and would try to book it again the next time in Montreal. ","10"
"Amazing place to stay, great location. 
Heated tiles !!!!
","10"
"We had a great stay at this property! It was clean and well maintained with lots of plants. Looks just like the pictures, but feels even cooler in person. The neighborhood is perfect if you like local clothing/design shops and great restaurants. Jason was communicative and checking in was very easy. ","10"
"We enjoyed our stay at Jason's apartment during our visit to Montreal between Christmas and New Year. The apartment was exactly as described / as it looked in the photos, a really nice space with everything you would need for your stay. The apartment is in a great neighbourhood with lots on your doorstep without having to venture into the city centre everyday. Some great recommendations in the guidebook. Jason was easy to contact before and during our stay. Would definitely recommend!","10"
"Jason and Guillame were excellent hosts. If you are a foodie, this apartment is located in the midst of a zillion delicious restaurants. It is in the middle of shopping, coffee, food, and people. This is not the area of Montreal that is touristy - you'll feel like a local walking around in the Mile End/Mount Royal. Thanks for an excellent stay! ","10"
"A very cool apartment in an amazing location! Jason is a great host and greeted me to check in, even though I arrived quite late.

For those who do not know the area; this is in the prime area of Mile End. Plenty of great shops, resto's, cafes and bars literally around the corner.

For all that, it is amazingly residential and quiet too. The roof terrace is one of the best I've seen and makes a wonderful location for your breakfast or dinner!

Thanks Jason.","10"
"This is a beautiful apartment in a fantastic neighborhood. Jason and Guillaume were very easy to communicate with, and they'd left us some good recommendations for things to do in the area. The apartment itself was so pretty and comfortable that we were tempted just to hang out there, even though the neighborhood has an abundance of great things: the best bagels and the best ice cream in Montreal, etc. Highly recommended!","10"
"Perfect location in the heart of the Mile End neighborhood. Walk to everything i.e., shops, restaurants, nightlife etc. but still located on a quite street. The home was clean and comfortable with a gorgeous rooftop.   Would definitely stay again. ","10"
"Amazing place. Perfect","10"
"We loved the apartment. Couldn't ask for a better location. It's right next to restaurants and bar, as well as a close walk to the Metro. The place was quiet, well-maintained and as good (if not better) than it appears in the photos. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a private retreat in Montreal. ","10"
"This place is better in real! Excellent location, very easy check -in, cozy and spotless clean apartment! Fabulous top floor terrace. Jason has been a very good host. Responsive and punctual. Thank you for the opportunity to enjoy this little paradise!","10"
"Guillaume’s home was absolutely perfect for our 10 day trip to Montreal. His home was super clean, modern and comfortable with huge windows and fantastic views. Located in the heart of the mile end, surrounded by restaurants, cafes and shops but tucked away enough to be quite at night. We would definitely stay there again, merci!","10"
"Appartement parfait en tous points.","10"
"The apartment was just as pictured, very clean and modern and the roof deck was lovely. The location was great with lots of wonderful restaurants and cafes just steps away. We especially enjoyed the Sparrow and Cafe Olimpico. Navigating street parking in Mile End is rather confusing, read the signs carefully!","10"
"Jason and Guillaume’s home is amazingly located and uber clean. Would happily return next time I visit Montreal.","10"
"Staying at Jason's place was like a trip back in time to the olden era if airbnb.  It was so nice to be in someone's actual home.  They are also excellent hosts.  The apartment is comfortable with a good kitchen and bed.   The location is excellent.  We were traveling with out cat who absolutely loved the stairs.","10"
"We had a wonderful stay at Jason's.  The apartment is beautiful and modern, very clean, airy, and in the best location, in the heart of Mile End.  The bed is really comfortable and it's lovely to have the roof deck.  Jason is easy to communicate with and gives great neighborhood recommendations.  This is our second time staying here and we hope to stay here again.","10"
"Jason’s place is more beautiful in person than seen in the photos on the listing. We absolutely loved this apartment, it was clean and saturated in natural light. The bed was comfortable, shower and soaker tub were great and I loved the plants through out the apartment. And of course, the rooftop terrace was an amazing addition to our trip. Jason was easy to communicate with before, during and after our trip. Thank you for your hospitality!","10"
"Great! do not hesitate to book it","10"
"Jason's place is the kind of airbnb you want to live in. It's beautiful. Smart finishes, great amenities. The area is perfect. You couldn't change a thing.","10"
"Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at hands down and also the only Airbnb I’ve ever visited that I truly wished I lived there. The place is absolutely beautiful, the surrounding area has many amazing places to eat. If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll deff stay here and you should too. I already miss being there","10"
"Excellent hôte, Unal est au petit soin avec vous. Je le recommande vivement. Le logement est plutôt bien placé (jardin la Fontaine à proximité), bien équipé et conforme à la description. J'ai passé un excellent séjour.","9"
"The location is in a quiet nighborhood located a quick 5-10 minute drive from downtown Montreal. Also very close to Saint Laurent Boulevard and Mont Royal Street where you can find restaurants, clubs and some shopping to be done without having to go to the downtown core. The host is very knowledgeable of the area and extremely helpful. If you want an affordable hassle free stay, look no further.","9"
"The place was very clean and cozy! Great location too right outside downtown area.","9"
"Très joli studio, très propre, lit très confortable. L’hôte est très gentil et très arrangeant. Je recommande vraiment cet appartement !","9"
"Pros:
Excellent renovated unit.  Everything is new.
The location is close to stores for food (5 minute walk) and bus stop (1 minute walk).  The metro is near but about a 15 minutes walk away.
The kitchen is great for making meals, the temperature of the unit is adjustable and comfortable.
Strong wifi signal.
Lots of closet space.  Good lighting.
Lots of dishes and great nonstick pan.

The cons:
Noise late at night and early in the morning.
Being right at the bottom of the staircase means you hear everyone going up and down the stairs at all hours.
Being near the main entrance,  you hear the front door constantly slamming.
The location of the building is great however the traffic is fairly loud. Not recommended for light sleepers unless you can sleep with earplugs.
Construction noise from the building during the day.
The host was good at responding (a plus) except when I got there for check in and couldn't get a reply.  This was especially stressful since it was my first stay in any Air BnB.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 117 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Great spot. Has everything you need. Just north of downtown MTL","9"
"It's ideally placed and the place itself is amazing!","10"
"Nimi's place is in a great location, close to all the attractions Montreal has to offer, and the apartment is much larger than it appears to be from the outside, with very high ceilings and a very comfortable living area. Nimi was great in providing everything that would be needed for our stay and the parking was very much appreciated. The place was decently clean except that large parts of the apartment had dusty floors. The TV did not work as well, which was a bit disappointing, but the excellent WiFi made up for that. ","10"
"Spacious apartment is a perfect location within walking distance of McGill, Mount Royal, the Jazz Fest, the old city, trendy shops and restaurants, and great nightlife.","10"
"Great location, lots of space and easy to find. ","10"
"The house is located in a  very nice Neighbourhood. The host was very accommodating and helped us sending our clothes back as we left them in the house. Recommended to all guests. Thank you!","10"
"Beautiful place very spacious! Enjoyed this place a lot! Just don’t park outside of the place you will get a ticket.","10"
"Nimi was quick to respond when we booked. She took us in when our previous booking cancelled on us the night before we arrived at Montreal. The apartment was above our expectations, with nice touches on the Reno to give a homely feel. 

Nimi even sent her son to help us settle in, whom was totally helpful, even following us to show us the parking spot around the back, and helping us with the luggage. 

It's exactly as per their write up on the listing, plus it's quite near to the city centre which is a big plus. Place was also spacious with a nice area for the family to gather around for card games and tv. Covenience store is just around the corner with another bigger super market just a few blocks down.  

would definitely consider this again if I ever do return to Montreal! Thanks Nimi, you and your son have been awesome!
","10"
"Great host and location.  Parking on site and the space was very spacious.","10"
"Rachelle's place is a convenient walk from YUL. Very clean in a quiet neighbourhood.","10"
"Cute little space in the backyard,  everything is very clean, very close to the airport!","10"
"The host communicates in a fast way and she is very accommodating of my needs","10"
"Very beautiful room with nice bohemic interior and glass roof, good access to bathroom and shower. Got everything needed and amazing hospitality by Rachelle!","10"
"Rachelle is the coolest host! I slept here for a night as I had a long layover. I chose to walk to the airbnb; I got lost for a second but it was pretty straightforward once I went through the TransCanada parking lot. This was the first private room that I stayed in while using Airbnb, Rachelle made the experience very chill and exceptional. I highly recommend this room!","10"
"Great host. Second stay in less than 2 weeks. Highly recommended.","10"
"Rachelle and Carl were the perfect hosts. The room was quirky and comfortable. The perfect spot if you need to be near the airport.","10"
"Accueil chaleureux et chambre confortable,  c'est l'endroit idéal si on souhaite rester près de l'aéroport.","10"
"Great shower, safe space, quiet home","10"
"The ‘Bohemian’ is perfect for solo stays and the bed was comfy so I slept well.  Morning breakfast was a total pleasure....lively conversation with amiable hosts, great coffee, plus homemade pancakes can’t be beat.  I left happy and totally ready for the day ahead.  Highly recommended!","10"
"Conveniently located close to the airport -30 minute walk- and this room is located in the solarium of the house which makes it OK for a short overnight stay. For me that’s all I needed due to my overnight layover but if you want more privacy she has other rooms available in the house, which she has in very good conditions, clean and all set. She’s very kind, always ready to help and cares for your confort and wellbeing while your stay. I totally recommend her.","10"
"Room is better than the pictures, there's more furniture now in the apartment, maybe the pics should be updated. The metro is really close and there's supermarkets, restaurants, coffee shops and services near. Safe and quiet neighborhood.  

It's perfect for someone who's looking for a place to rest, rather than having the Canadian experience of living with a family as Will is an student. Despite he's busy is always open to help you and provide you a good experience.","9"
"Great value for money accommodation. As long as you don't mind the communal student-like kitchen/bathroom sharing you'll have a lovely stay :)","9"
"William was a great host and had everything set up for me when I arrived.  The space was clean and nice, and the room I stayed in had a locking door, which made me feel secure leaving my stuff there when I went out (there are multiple, seperaterooms in the apartment).  He responded right away to any messages I sent him and made sure my stay was a great experience.  Cheers!","9"
"The place is great for the price, there are some minor things of note. Room was spacious and large, but ventilation to the main room with the AC was subpar. You will feel very uncomfortable if there is a heat wave. Aside from that, the facilities were modern and all functional. Place is somewhat close to the subway, 5 minute walk to Joliette station, and the 29 comes right outside the door. For the price, you can’t go wrong.","9"
"Belle espace, propre et bien localiser. On ne se sent pas dans l'intimité des hôtes","9"
"William was extremely quick in his communications and his place was close to the metro. A/C was useful during the summer heat, and the room locks.","9"
"William is an amazing host, he was so understanding of any issues I had during my stay. The room seemed bigger than the pictures which is nice, and the common areas are quite large aside from the bathroom being on the smaller side. I would just note that there can be up to 6 other guests during your stay, alongside 2 long term houseguests. While there we had 10 people to one bathroom which was a lot, but if your comfortable with shared spaces between a lot of people then I definitely recommend Williams place especially for the price. The metro is maybe a 5 minute walk, super close! ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Pratique pour la proximité des transports. Logement partagé entre loueurs (4 chambres dont un dortoir). Pas de propriétaire sur place. Parties communes sales. En revanche, pas cher.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"We are very please with our recent experience at Veronique's place. The space is align with the pictures and descriptions; very nicely renovated condo, with lots of space. We were travelling with our two daughters and they felt as welcome as we did. There was everything we needed, and more. We were pleasantly surprised with thoughtful little details. There were little notes around the condo to help us find our way, which was very helpful. We were also provided with a detailed list of things to do and great spots nearby.
Great location; proximity to amenities and public transportation (2 metro stations within walking distance). 
Excellent communication; Veronique was quick to answer any questions I had as we were preparing for our trip,  but once we arrive everything was perfect so we did not need to reach out.
Overall, the space met and even exceed our expectations. We will definitely be verifying availability here for our next Montreal vacation. Thank you for a wonderful week !
","10"
"Exactly as described, highly recommend.","9"
"The apartment was exactly as photographed. Beautiful and clean place with great amenities. I would choose Sonder’s as a host again. They provide 24/7 service and replied in a timely manner. Even made a courtesy call after a minor error was made to ensure we got the correct information. Thank you Sonders!","9"
"Nous avons adoré notre séjour à Montréal et notre logement ! L’appartement était exactement conforme aux photos du site, idéalement situé au cœur du centre-ville, à proximité immédiate des commerces et transports, et pourtant au calme ! Nous n’avions pas reçu les instructions d’entrée à notre arrivée mais l’agence a été très réactive pour arranger ce désagrément. Á recommander sans hésitation !","9"
"Great space, quick access, price, more than expected. Totally worth it.","9"
"Overall, wonderful location close to attractions and public transport. Very clean and looks better than the photos!   Had issues with door code and door system over our 4 day stay, but customer service was easily reached both times.","9"
"This was a prime location as it is central to local spots and is within walking distance to many essentials, i.e., grocery stores, cafes/coffee shops, restaurants/takeaways and convenience stores. 
Sonders provided exemplary service from providing a functioning iron and ironing board at the time of our arrival, as well as, offering 24 hr support when we had any question or concern. 
Two minute details of improvement would be to provide a full body mirror in the apartment as taller individuals, like myself, have to kneel down in order to view themselves in the washrooms mirror. Secondly, an extra throw blanket for those cold winter nights would have made our stay that much more enjoyable. 
Overall, staying with Sonder was an utter delight.","9"
"Great location to access both Old Port and the shops near St. Catherine. Plenty of great eateries within just a block or two. Clean and stylish condo.","9"
"Ce séjour a été magnifique et ça a tellement cliqué avec Touria ! Je me suis sentie comme chez une amie  :-) et en plus tout était impeccable. L'appartement est calme, à 3min des commerces et lignes de bus.  Qualité prix imbattable, je le recommande fortement. Un gros merci à Touria :-)","10"
"Je vous recommande fortement le logement de Touria. Il est très bien situé à Montréal (la chouette rue Masson avec restos, bars, commerces a 1 minute), il est propre et très agréable. De plus, il est particulièrement silencieux. Il y a un très grand «walk in» dans la chambre, et le lit est très confortable. Touria saura vous guider à Montréal avec gentillesse et proximité. Un vrai plaisir de loger chez elle !","10"
"Mon séjour passé chez Touria était formidable. Elle m’a chaleureusement accueillie et m’a mise rapidement à l’aise. Tout le confort absolu. Toutes les pièces étaient propres et bien aérées. Ma chambre était spacieuse et jolie avec un grand « walk in closet » Le lit était confortable, du coup toutes mes nuits étaient agréables. Je me suis bien reposée pendant tout mon séjour. Touria est une hôte de classe supérieure. Elle parle avec tant de douceur et d’élégance. Elle est si agréable et très conviviale.  Ce fut un réel plaisir de séjourner chez Touria. Je reviendrai encore chez elle si l’opportunité se présente et je la recommande vivement à tout le monde.

"Very nice place with amazing location and good restaurants","10"
"Touria and her husband live in a quiet neighourhood with trees and lots of friendly cats. There are lots of restaurants nearby, and once you figure out the bus to the Metro, you can do anythi g you want.","10"
"It is a very quiet location. With bus transportation nearby, It is much easier to go for the down town than I expected.
I am sure I will choose it for next visit.","10"
"It is a wonderful and comfortable home, full of good energy !!!","10"
"Great place to stay in Montreal if you want to be close to downtown but avoid the hustle and bustle. Beautiful view of the river from the top floor of the building. A very quaint, clean and quiet apartment with a lot of charm. Would definitely stay there again.","10"

"El alojamiento de Alexandra tiene una ubicación excelente, puedes llegar caminando a diversos puntos de interés y también está cerca del metro y paradas de autobús. 
El alojamiento está muy limpio, corresponde a lo que se muestra en las fotos y Alexandra es una súper host, siempre amable y dispuesta a ayudar y hacer de tu estancia la mejor experiencia, definitivamente me quedaría ahí de nuevo!","10"

"Recomiendo ampliamente este alojamiento, es excelente lo que muestra en las fotos tal cual está, muy limpio, cómodo, cuentas con todos los servicios, Alex es una estupenda anfitriona, nos ayudo en todo lo que le preguntamos, nos dio varias recomendaciones de primera vez, todo está muy bien instalado.
Donde vive es una zona muy linda que se encuentran 2 parques, muy hermosos. Todo excelente, seguro me volvería a quedar si regreso a Montréal","10"
"Alex’s place is in a fabulous location. Tons of shops and restaurants very close by. The subway is only a 7 min walk away. The place was very clean and tidy and looks just like the pictures. Alex was very friendly and offered us tips about some great places to check out. It does get quite hot in the apartment since there is no air conditioning. The room gets direct sun for most of the day and the curtains are quite sheer. There was a table fan in the bedroom that helped a bit but we didn’t sleep well. The bed was smaller than I expected. It looked like a queen in the photos but it was a double so its a bit snug for 2 people if you are used to stretching out when sleeping.  It sits on a large piece of wood on the frame instead of a box spring, so it creaks loudly anytime someone moves. We also found the pillows to be very thin. Overall though for the price  it was a good deal. If you are looking for a budget place to stay I would recommend staying here as you can’t beat the location! ","10"
"Alexandra is a lovely host, and the apartment was clean, in a great location, and had everything I needed.","10"
"L appartement d'Alexandra est vraiment bien situé, très agréable et très propre! Alexandra à été très arrangeante et disponible tout au long de notre séjour! Je recommande vivement!","10"
"Le logement est bien situé près de rues animées pour autant celui-ci est dans une rue résidentielle très calme. L'hôte est très agréable et réactive même si nous l'avons peu vu dû à des horaires divergents. De plus, le logement est propre et agréable.","10"
"Great location!","10"
"To those visiting Montreal. Alex's place will have you close to Mont-Royal *best view of the city* 30 minutes walk to Old Montreal. and 15 minutes walk to the best poutine place ( la banquise)
If you are coming by car. make sure you know exactly where to park, otherwise you will be dinged with a paring ticket.","10"
"Merci pour l’accueil, nous avons passé un bon week-end dans un charmant quartier, pas trop loin du centre ville.
L’appartement est propre et agréable ! ","10"
"Great location, close to walk to everything I wanted to see. Room was as described. Friendly and helpful host. Recommended stay. Everything you need for a budget traveller ","10"
"Good value, clean. A bit stuffy though so room could use a bigger fan but it was a nice stay.","10"
"Alexandra's place is in a great location within 10 minutes walk from Sherbrooke subway station if you're coming by public transit. Very walkable to local restaurants/cafes and shops. There is also a nice fruit market within 5 to 10 minutes walking distance. If you are coming in the in summer, it's important to know that there is no air conditioning in the apartment but there is a fan in the bedroom. It is a very neat and tidy place with a kitchen you can use to prepare meals. When I went, Alexandra was not in town so I had the whole place to myself. I needed some help and though there was a bit of a delay, Alexandra answered all my questions.

"Writing this review for my mother: 

My husband, 1 year old daughter and my parents went to an impromptu trip  to Montreal for 5 days and we stayed at Victors Airbnb. His place is on the second floor apartment with an outdoor staircase (typical in Montreal) and is pretty cool. His apartment is all brand new and renovated. we instantly felt like home. It’s centrally located and the train station is within a couple of blocks and possibly a 5-10 min walk (longer for us because we had my parents and a stroller in tow lol). The parking signs in Montreal is pretty confusing but we had a lot of help from the neighbors who explained it to us. We had no problem finding parking literally across the street from the apartment. 

What was also great was the lockbox! We didn’t have to wait for him to enter or to leave him the key. communication was effortless and he always answered our questions in a timely matter.  The apartment had everything you needed to literally feel comfortable. 

Overall, we would def. come back and stay at his Airbnb and highly recommend it! ","9"
"Great location and Victor was very responsive.  Check in was seamless. There weren't enough towels for us but other than that we had everything we needed.","9"
"Great stay!","9"
"Appartement idéalement situé, proche de restaurants comme de supermarché. Nous avons essentiellement déambulé à pied. Silencieux, situé dans une rue très calme. L’appartement est impeccable. Très bonne expérience.","9"
"Great times","9"
"Beautiful apartment in Montreal. After our arrival, Victor provided us with some items missing in the apartment: towel, soap, salt, etc. Just to take into account: the apartment is extreamly clean, but it misses basic elements to mantain the kitchen clean (scourer, for instance). The stairs are difficult to climb, and regarding the ubication, you need more than 30 minutes by foot to reach the Place des Arts.","9"
"Perfect location. We had a great time exploring, eating and drinking through Montreal neighborhoods. ","9"
"very nice place will come back next time","9"
"Victor's apartment is in a fantastic location.  Just one block off St Denis, it's central yet relaxed and peaceful. There's a fabulous Japanese restaurant with outstanding ramen at the foot of the road, a bakery with every imaginable pastry less than two blocks away, two Zagat-listed bistros within 5 minute walk, and an organic grocery store just steps from your front door on St. Denis.  The metro is close, but you can also walk to McGill University, up Mont Royal for amazing views, and over to Mile End for funky food and fashion. The apartment itself is super clean and comfortable.","9"
"Clean and comfortable room","6"
"The host was very accommodating and extremely sweet. She took great care of us. The room that we stayed in looked amazing and was clean until we looked behind the bed. There was a lot of dust or sawdust .. not sure which and unfortunately my nephew got allergies as he is allergic to dust. The home needs a bit of TLC. The bathroom was also not in a great shape, there was a hole where the toilet paper role was but it got fixed the very next day, which was great. The unfortunate part is that we didn't realize it was a shared bathroom with other guests which was quite annoying as we are quite picky people . It is mentioned under house rules that it is a  shared bathroom. I wish this was written upfront on the summary page. Also whenever we wanted to go back to the house we had to call the host as we did not have the keys. The host was very accommodating but we felt bad going late. Once again the host was amazing very patient and nice but some things in the house were lacking.","6"
"가격 대비 별로~~~","6"
"Feel like home","6"
"Room was okay but too much chaos. host advised privacy but there was constant interference. Air conditioning in the room was leaking and host advised to keep checking so we had to keep an all night to see for water leak. I was conjusted and the value we paid was not even 1% worth what we got. I wont suggest if you are looking something clean and private o lying suitable for a ghetto place. Host was good and responsive but the place didnt do justice.","6"

"Not flashy but a great place for a short stay. Convenient with the keypad entry, and the AC keeps it cool at night. Very clean.","9"
"very straight-forward listing. nothing fancy but an absolute perfect location for exploring downtown Montreal. i recommend this place for travellers that don't have a lot of time but want to get around to a ton of stuff while in town.","9"
"Excellent, malgré la chaleur j'y ai passé une excellente nuit !","9"
"It's a small space but perfect place just to sleep at night. Check in is very easy and the location is convenient. AC unit made the space comfortable. Great value. 
The only downfalls are that there is no wifi (made it difficult to find directions and order ubers) and its on the 4th floor with no elevator.  Would definitely stay here again. ","9"
"If you’re looking for a space that is simple, inexpensive, and has just the necessities  you need for a couple of nights- this place will be great for you! ","9"
"Very close to all restaurants and main street we walked very close. Place is quiet and room smell good.","9"
"Logement d'une seule nuit, cela est suffisant, l'appartement est petit mais reste correcte pour une dernière nuit à Montréal afin d'être prêt de l'aéroport pour un vol de retour.

"Très beau logement, conforme à l'annonce, avec une belle vue sur la ville, un accès à une salle de sport, une piscine et un sauna.  A 2 pas du mont Royal et proche du centre ville.
Propre, lumineux.
Un seul petit regret: l'absence de réponse de l'hôte aux messages (ce qui m'a poussé jusqu'à annuler puis à reprendre après réception de la réponse). Aucun regret d'avoir repris, au contraire. 
Je recommande ce logement, sans hésitation.","10"
"Great place to stay, view is absolutely stunning! I love that the place is so bright and well lit. Would definitely recommend for the price point!","10"

"Carole's place is the perfect spot for a Montreal getaway. It's in a great location where you can walk everywhere and the concierge were all so friendly! It has stellar views of the city from the room plus from the roof top terrace and pool which was a real treat. The apartment was also very clean and it doesn't look like anyone lives there so felt more like a hotel rather than being in someone else's living space which was nice","10"
"This apartment is lovely and spacious for a studio, and a steal for the location as well! I was in town for an event at McGill and it was super convenient to stay at Carole's place. Everything worked perfectly, and the doormen/women were helpful and kind. There were also at least 2 convenience stores close by, in case you forgot any toiletries like I did. Carole was also very responsive when I had small questions and flexible with the check-in time. Would highly recommend!","10"

Clean and great location.

"Todo estuvo muy bien, el apartamento es precioso, súper limpio y muy cómodo. Muy cerca del centro y la atención del conserje impecable, pero eché de menos respuestas por parte de la anfitriona a preguntas sobre el check in y la disponibilidad para guardar las maletas durante el día hasta el momento de entrar. No hubo comunicación fluida aunque sí me indicó cómo conseguir las llaves del apartamento.","10"
"The place is very well located and the space is very accurate to the pictures. We stayed only 1 night but would stay again there","10"
"We had a great time in Montreal and Carole’s place was very clean, everything was well organised and ready for our arrival. The gym and swimming pool with view was a nice touch! Perfect location too.","10"

"We had a great stay at Carole's apartment. 
Good 
- great central location to downtown MTL
- Clean
- Comfy bed
- Carole is very responsive

Could be better
- There was no soap or toilet paper when we arrived. I notified Carole and she was reachable right away. Luckily she had extra supplies in a nearby unit so I was able to restock our place. 
- The place was a bit cold because the heating unit was off. We had to leave it on the whole time to keep the place some what warm.
- Apartment overall was a bit dated

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone else. We didn't stay long at the apartment and just needed a place to sleep so the dated look and temperature of the apartment wasn't a big deal.

Great value!","10"
"The building is an amazing area for food and shopping. The balcony has a nice street view & the space inside is adorable. 
Would book with Carole again for another trip.","10"
"Très joli appartement, idéalement situé, non loin de la rue Sainte Catherine et très bien équipé. Nous y avons passé un très agréable moment.","10"

"Si vous recherchez un endroit typiquement Montréalais , cozy et bien situé , n'hésitez plus. Pascale est d'une grande gentillesse et disponibilité. Nous avons apprécié ses petites attentions. Le logement est fonctionnel, très bien équipé et propre. Sa décoration inspirée par ses nombreux voyages fait que nous nous y sentons bien immédiatement. De plus, le logement est situé dans un quartier très agréable, calme et dynamique à la fois. À 2 min à pied , se trouve un grand parc ainsi que toutes les commodités nécessaires. Vous pourrez aisement vous y promener. 
Ce fût une très bonne expérience pour nous. ","10"

"Fantastic location, beautiful view!
Clean and big room!","9"
"Great stay! Awesome location","9"
"We stayed for a short 3 days ,  it was a lovely place. We were able to walk everywhere and at night the area was quite. The rooftop patio was excellent! The host was very responsive and it was easy to check in.  Coffee on the balcony in the mornings was a nice way to start the day.  Only thing was maybe a roll of paper towels or napkins would have been great.   
Carrie from Boston.","9"
"The night we arrived, there was a fire in the neighbourhood and it made getting onto the street the Airbnb is located on an extremely stressful process. Obtaining the keys/check in/parking required several steps which added to the stress we were already experiencing (I imagine that the check in process would not have been so stressful under normal circumstances but the check in process could have been simpler - just something to be aware of). 

Having said that, the apartment itself is lovely (very spacious and clean) and the hosts were extremely helpful and responsive once we were checked in. They were flexible and made our stay comfortable. The space is located near metros and is walkable to major downtown areas and attractions.","9"
"Excelente localização.  Porém o ambiente é muito impessoal e o anfitrião não respondeu aos nossos e-mails durante a estadia, para a solução de problemas.","9"
"perfect located, wide spaces, complicated procedure for check in; you must have smartphone and connectivity to do it. ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"We had a bad experience. Arriving in Montreal, we found the key not in the designated location. Upon calling the host we were told that our unit was unavailable due to flooding. Despite booking months in advance, we only were sent an email hours before our expected arrival (which was not useful due to being out of range). We were then told that no other unit was available and that they ""were having a bad day, too"". We had to scramble to find a last minute hotel.","9"
"My dad loved it! Thanks!","10"
"We really loved our stay at Nikki’s place. We communicated very easily with our host whenever we had questions. The place was spick and span at our arrival and Nikki had let us some towels to bath wich we really appreciated. The airbnb’s location is very well situated. It is close to St-Laurent and St-Catherine’s street wich is cool if you love to shop. Unfortunately, there was no parking spot available in the street during our stay, but we parked our car at Excentris Public Parking wich is 5 minutes away by walk from the airbnb. We wouldn’t hesitate to come back to Nikki’s place if we have the chance!","10"
"Beautiful place and great location!","10"
"Exactly as pictured. Nikki was a great host and the location was amazing.","10"
"Presque tout de suite après l'envoi de ma demande, Nikki l'a acceptée et a été disponible pour répondre à mes questions. Quand je suis entré dans l'appartement, j'ai été impressionné par la propreté des lieux. En plus, ça sentait bon. Le balcon donne une belle vue sur une ruelle typiquement montréalaise. C'est situé au début du Plateau, juste en haut du Quartier des spectacles, du Quartier latin et du centre-ville. À deux pas de la rue Prince-Arthur, du boulevard Saint-Laurent et du carré Saint-Louis. L'appartement a aussi un beau plancher de bois franc. Tout s'est bien déroulé. J'encourage quiconque désirant passer du temps à Montréal à choisir le logement de Nikki. Mieux qu'à l'hôtel, c'est peu dire !","10"
"Nikki's place is a short walk from anywhere you want to be in Montreal. I didn't need to drive or Uber anywhere the whole time I was there. The place itself is completely new, clean, and modern. Nikki was very quick to respond to any of my inquiries (and hooked me up with an awesome poutine spot :) Would highly recommend to anyone visiting this wonderful, unique city!","10"
"Perfect spot. You won’t be disappointed!!","10"
"We loved our stay! This lovely pied-à-terre was wonderful. The place was spotless, and Nikki was extremely communicative and helpful. The location is wonderful - perfectly situated near Mont Royal park, and the restaurants, bars and shops of the Plateau. ","10"
"Nikki''s place was fantastic. Super close to coffee shops and restaurants, shops at a walking distance. You can walk or ride a bike if you prefer to go to old Montreal from Nikki''s place. The studio was super neat, clean and with everything you need . I would recommended to anyone. ","10"
"The space is exactly like the pictures, and it’s very clean, cozy and quaint. It’s in a great location—walkable to Mount Royal as well as local bars, shops and restaurants. Nikki is a great host and took the time to put together a list of restaurant recommendations for us! I’d highly recommend this place for a weekend visit in Montreal!","10"

"Nikki is a great host, very responsive and this apartment has everything you would need for a stay in a Montreal.

"Clean stylish place to stay! Within walking distance of tons of restaurants and bars. Parking was a bit farther than expected, but overall a great stay!","10"
"I had a lovely stay at Nikki’s place on a solo adventure to Montreal for 3 nights. It was incredibly clean and looked brand new. There is a lovely terrace in the back that is very quiet and overall the building and apartment were super quiet. The location is perfect—not far from everything you need in the Plateau but on a pretty quiet residential street. Nikki was very easy to communicate with and gave me updates as needed. I’d highly recommend this place.","10"
"Great  clean place and the location was perfect.","10"
"This place is so clean and in a perfect location for everything you would want to explore in Montreal. Nikki is so nice and helpful!","10"
"The location is amazing if you are into clubs; I personally found the flat itself quite stylish and easy to walk to old town from.

I highly recommend staying here","10"
"Nikki’s place is an amazing spot to stay in Montreal — centrally located in Le Plateau with great coffee shops, bars, restaurants and breweries nearby. Especially great is the proximity to Mont-Royal, if you enjoy running outdoors. The apartment is very charming with a cute small back porch. We arrived to find it very clean, and the AC worked great (necessary in the 90+ degrees we had this August). There is also Netflix connected on the TV. The only (small) downside is that the shower pressure isn’t great. ","10"
"This was a great apartment for visiting Montreal.  It’s in a cool neighborhood and easy to get around town from here. Nikki was very responsive and a helpful host.","10"
"Very cute and comfortable spot right by all of the hip areas of Montreal. 10 Min walk from Mont Royal, Chinatown, about 20 min walk from downtown. Super super clean and convenient. Only problem was the internet went out at one point and that issue was not resolved for the remainder of the stay. It wasn't a huge problem since there are plenty of cafes in the neighborhood, but it was not ideal. It did not ruin the trip though!","10"
"Nikki is a great host and the place is spectacular! Not large but a stylish, clean and cozy bachelor suite right beside St Laurent and lots of shops, restaurants and bars. Communicating with Nikki was always easy - very quick to respond. Great little jem worth every penny!","10"

"This was a great home for us the 2 days we were in MTL visiting family. Beautiful building, spotless interior and great location for us. Would stay here again when we come back to Montreal.","10"
"This place is exactly as it seems and more. It is very stylish and is in a fantastic neighborhood. It's close to downtown but such a cool neighborhood to hang out in. Even the bed is comfortable (a slat bed).  

The kitchen has everything you would want to cook with as a bonus. Though Montreal restaurants are soo good you might never get to use them.","10"
"Excellent property in a lively part of the city, close to the centre. I loved the restaurants and cafes nearby.","10"

"très bien","10"
"Best Airbnb we've stayed in! Everything was clean and in great condition. We were so impressed with the quality of the apartment. When we booked, we wondered if the size of the space would be an issue, but the finishes are beautiful and the apartment is very well laid out, cozy, and highly functional. 

The thing that really impressed us the most was how well equipped the kitchen was. As a couple who tends to cook a lot, this was greatly appreciated. We've noticed that a lot of Airbnb hosts say they have a well equipped kitchen, but they have just a few plates, glasses, and cutlery. This place has everything you would need: non-stick pans, nice knives, cutting boards, can opener, baking sheets, strainer, salad bowl, French press, toaster...everything. There was also oil, vinegar, coffee, etc. The kitchen also has a nice layout with great counter space and a bar to eat at.

The location is great. We were within walking distance to grocery stores, shops, pubs, and cafes. It was a nice neighborhood, quiet and safe. We also had no trouble walking from there to many of the attractions we wanted to see, including Old Montreal. However, the Metro is close by (Sherbrooke station) and can quickly get you anywhere you need to go.

Nikki and Jean-Louis were great hosts. We would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Excellent accueil, grande hospitalité de la par des hôtes, ils ont su bien nous accommoder. Emplacement génial, nous recommandons cette place à n’importe qu’elle voyageur!","10"
"Wow, wow, wow! Nikki’s place is just great! Super location close to shops, restaurants and cafes! The apartment is recently renovated and all looks just perfect! Host and co-hosts super accommodating and kind! Thanks for everything!","10"
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Nikki's place during our stay in Montreal.  This place is in a great location, right next to shopping, the Metro, endless restaurants.  Nikki's place is very nicely decorated and included all the necessities for preparing food at the apartment.  His place was also very clean and easily accessible.  There were also nice tips left for you if you're not familiar with the area.  We were very happy that we found this place and hope to return in the future.  Thanks Nikki!","10"
"Perfect location to be in the center of it all!","10"
"Amazing location! Very convenient.","10"
"Une belle place à 10 minutes du métro et tout proche des bus, idéal pour un séjour à Montréal.","10"
"Nikki was a great host. He responded quickly to any questions we had and was accommodating. The place was very clean and well-kept. The kitchen was well-stocked , and the bed was very comfortable - perfect after a long day of exploring the city. The location was perfect. It’s within walking distance to everything you could need! We loved it so much we extended our stay!","10"
"Really brilliant apartment and really good value!","10"
"This is a great place. It's super clean, everything is new and tidy. I spent almost three weeks here, and what's great about the place is that everything's there: from umbrella to ironing board, and from whisk to knife set. Everything you reasonably might expect to need---it's there. Couldn't have been happier with it!","10"
"Highly recommended!","10"
"Great place, well decorated, clean and in a prime location. My only criticism is that there wasn’t a lockbox and we had to coordinate times with the owner to pickup/drop off the keys.","9"
"Nice spot, good location. However, perhaps this was just an unfortunate anomaly, but the apartment had not been cleaned between the last guest(s) and myself, so I had to do that myself - not a great way to start a trip. Also, I had an issue with getting into the apartment as the host was unable to meet me. Essentially I had to wait in the lobby for a stranger to let me in. ","9"
"Le logement est très bien situé mais Ikram aurait avantage à classer un peu ses choses afin de laisser de l'espace aux voyageurs pour s'installer: frigo, salle de bain..etc. ","9"
"Cute little condo south of Griffintown 3 minutes from the Lachine Canal, however that makes for a bit of a hike to the nearest metro of the 'happening' parts of Griffintown restaurants/shops/nightlife, and unfortunately the area is presently (summer 2018( undergoing extensive construction. Ikram was a good host and excellent communication, quick to respond to and requests or questions - unfortunately we had a few hiccups with arrival and towels etc, but we managed to sort them out in the end.","9"
"Loved the location and shops nearby! Great bike ride to old Montreal and the hospitality was great! Ikram replied very quickly and we were able to really enjoy ourselves. I think my only negative was the lack of towels, paper towels , toilet paper in the condo.","9"
"Great location and communication during my stay. Thanks!","9"

"Ikram's place was quiet, clean and comfortable. It was a 20 minute walk to the metro and has a lovely view of Montreal. Ikram responded very quickly to any questions or concerns we had. It was our first time visiting Montreal and this place made us feel at ease. ","9"

"Beware that the apartment is small! No A/C and only one window in the main bedroom. It was kept very clean but didn't have toilet paper upon arrival. Irina told us she'd reimburse us if we purposed it ourselves. The location is great in the Plateau and walk-able to the mile end and plenty of restaurants and shops.","9"
"The stay was wonderful. Cute small newly renovated apartment. Was super convenient to downtown. The apartment was also in a great location as it was walking distance to many shops and restaurants.

"This location is ideal, wonderful and close to everything you need. It was also very clean and comfortable with all the amenities (including utensils and dishes) you could need.  Irina is a great host (and the check-in was easy). Highly recommend!","9"
"What a wonderful location! Perfect distance from the Metro and so much to see, smell and taste. Stumbling upon a jazz trio less than a block away on a Monday night is as good as it gets. The place is wonderful – stylish, equipped, clean – for any couple looking for a taste of Montreal.","9"
"Very clean, very efficient and good sleep as the bedroom is located on the quiet backlane, not on the front street","9"
"Comment évaluer le sejour chez Anas vu qu'il n'y a pas eu de sejour ? Hote injoignable des jours en avance. Aucune réponse aux mails, Sms et appels car il s'agit d'un faux numéro de communiqué sur l'annonce Airbnb. Une fois sur place, et sans nouvelle, l'appartement n'existe pas, ou du moins l'hôte n'existe pas sur les registres du concierge. C'est ainsi le jour j, apres des heures de transport, que j'ai eu l'agréable surprise de n'avoir aucun logement avec pour seule solution : l'hôtel. Bref, hôte et logement à bannir. ","2"
"We had a great time there. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The apartment has everything you need and the neighborhood is very conveniently located.","10"
"Exactly what was advertised. Very clean and check-in and out was a breeze. Hamza is a fantastic host, responding right away and attentive to needs of guests. If you love the Plateau of Montreal this is the place for you. Really cool decor, including the old records on the wall. We actually made an apple music playlist of the tunes you will find there for fun: (Website hidden by Airbnb)","10"
"Hamza's home was beautiful! By far the best air bnb I've stayed at. It looks exactly like the pictures. The apartment is located right off the main drag where all the shops and restaurants are at. Its a super nice area with plenty to do. Would definitely come back and stay here again!","10"
"Our stay at Hamza’s flat was short lived but more than anything we could have asked for. It’s summer so it was hot - the area was air conditioned and cool throughout but still had natural light. A lot of thoughtful touches like coffee and snacks as well as restaurant recommendations and flexibility with our flight schedules. Hamza was extremely professional and very friendly. Thanks for an awesome stay :)","10"
"A stylish apartment in an incredible vibrant location. Great value for money. Sparking clean and great communication with the host.","10"
"A nice place, perfectly located, easy communication with Hamza.","10"
"Our family of four had a great stay at Hamza's apartment. It was even more spacious than it looks in the photos! 

Check in was quick and easy, and we had everything we needed when we arrived. The kitchen was well stocked with pots, utencils, and dishes and there was even cooking oil, salt, and pepper. We especially appreciated that there was plenty of coffee and sugar. Our kids loved that there was a basket of snacks. 

The bed was super comfortable, and our kids happily slept on the twin inflatable mattresses provided. They were the nice tall ones that would be comfortable for adults, too. 

The location was fantastic! It is close to many great shops, restaurants and bakeries and a quick walk to the metro. Even though it is on a fairly busy street, we heard almost no noise in the apartment. The private terrace was amazing as well. 

Hamza was readily available through chat and quickly responded to every question we had. We would gladly stay at Hamza's apartment again!","10"
"Hamza’s place exceeded our expectations and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay in Montreal! Communicating with Hamza was stress-free before and during our stay and I would highly recommend this Airbnb!","10"
"Beautiful apartment in a cool location!","10"
"Hamzas place is great and equipped really well. We felt at home and the location is excellent.","10"
"We just returned from a wonderful 2-night stay at Hamza's apartment.  The apartment was exactly as advertised, very clean, and at a great location.  There are plenty of shops, bars, and restaurants right outside your door.  The metro station is just a few blocks away, which can have you in the historic part of town in under 15 minutes.  The apartment was surprisingly quiet even though the bedroom over looks a busy street that had an end of summer street festival going on.  We (and our 3 month-old baby) had no issues with street noise at any point during the stay.  Hamza is very responsive to questions/requests and even proactively checked in with us after the first night.  Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would stay here again the next time we are in Montreal. ","10"
"Hamza's place was very modern, clean and well-situated. In addition, Hamza is super responsive and accommodating.","10"

"One of the best air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed in ❤️","10"
"Thank You for being such a gracious host Hamza. I could not have asked for a better host for our weekend getaway. 

The place was fantastic. It is clean, modern, spacious and inviting. Plenty of clean linens and extra blankets. The patio and its large double sliding doors opens up the space to the outdoors. Access to the place is simple and off a main street. Parking can be tough to find at times if you do drive, but I find that true for Montreal generally speaking.

Location was convenient, about a 10 min uber ride to downtown. about a 5 min walk to the closest metro station. Close to some popular restaurants, most of which are about 15-20 min walk.

Hamza was a great host. Checked in with us to make sure things were going well. He was always helpful, responded quickly to enquiries and questions. Ensured that our stay was enjoyable and that was his top priority. I had peace of mind while we were at this place.

I would definitely stay here again when visiting Montreal in the future!","10"
"Wonderful apartment, conveniently and centrally located for those looking to explore the city. The apartment was very clean and inviting, just as advertised. For those visiting during summer, the central air is a big plus. The main bedroom is located on a main street which may be loud for those looking for a quieter spot, but I had no issues with this at all coming from another city. Thanks to Hamza for the wonderful stay!","10"
"Hamza's place is great and stylish. It's just as described. Hamza is a great host and is very accommodating with requests and is quick to respond. I highly recommend staying here.","10"

"“The bed was very comfortable.” — My husband.
My husband spent several days at the apartment - and really enjoyed the neighborhood. He said there was a coffee shop right there, practically in the same building. He said the apartment was very comfortable, especially the mattress in the bedroom. He even researched it so we can buy it for our home.
He noted the place had a “weird” layout, with industrial-like flood lights and back door he hesitated to open, because he was afraid to trigger some alarm. He was happy the place was comfortably warm in the cold weather. Overall he enjoyed his stay.","10"
"-Idéalement situé dans quartier très sympa. 
-Plusieurs supermarchés autour 
-Super accueil avec touches d’attention
-propreté irréprochable 

Bref une super adresse.","10"
"My fiancé and I came to Montreal for a weekend getaway and I usually visit twice a year to see family and try out new restaurants. We stumbled upon Hamza's home after our original host cancelled our reservation and, to be quite honest, we're glad it was cancelled because Hamza's home was absolutely stellar. It was so much more than we expected: spacious, clean, and equipped with all  the necessary amenities that anyone would need. We can't wait to come again and we're certainly going to be staying at Hamza's! We've found our home away from home. Thanks so much for being an amazing and attentive host!","10"
"Fantastic location and clean!","10"
"The location is great -- the neighbourhood has lots of character and everything is in walking distance including some of the best food, music venues, shops etc. Also conveniently near the metro.

The apartment was clean, well kitted-out and spacious for a one-bed. It has a long and thin open layout with the kitchen separated from the living room/bedroom by a hallway. Polished concrete floors are stylish, but slightly cold on the feet -- maybe worth packing slippers. Some fun touches like the blackboard wall and popcorn machine.

I didn't meet Hamza but check-in went smoothly and communication was good. Thanks for a great stay!","10"
"Excellent airbnb! Great apartment, wonderful communication","10"
"Super appartement très design très propre et pas bruyant en plus wifi télé et Netflix en plus","10"
"I had a wonderful experience in Hamza's. The apartment is in the heart of Avenue Mont-Royal with many coffee shops, food spots, and shops just steps away. This place was everything I could have wanted - modern, spacious, great lighting, close to the metro, and filled with Montreal flavor. I'd definitely stay at Hamza's place and recommend his home highly.","10"
"The place was great very modern, super hip and clean. The location was perfect, very close to the train station, lots of restaurants and bars. Hamza as a host was very responsive to all of our questions and concerns. Would highly suggest staying here.","10"

L'appartement est idéal pour un couple, très propre, très bien aménagé et équipé pour y séjourner longtemps et très bien chauffé. L'emplacement est aussi très bon ! proche du métro Jarry ou Jean talon et de commodités (épiceries, Marché jean talon). Dans un quartier très calme tout en étant au cœur de l'île et des attractivités.
Mes parents sont enchantés et en plus, n'hésitez pas à louer: Johanne et Jules sont de merveilleux hôtes qui vous rappelleront pourquoi on aime airbnb à la base : rencontrer les gens et avoir un échange de bons procédés. Ils sont chaleureux, accueillant et disponibles. Aucun problème de communication à signaler. Allez-y les yeux fermés!","10"

"Abdoul’s place is perfectly located and is near to all the main attractions in Montreal. It is at a walking distance from the subway station and there are lots of shops nearby. The locality is peaceful. And the house is beautiful.
Abdoul is an amazing host and a joyful person. He shared many tips to travel around the city. He is happy to answer all queries. 
Thumbs up for Abdoul and his beautiful and cozy house.

Merci Abdou!","10"
"Seb's place is conveniently located just a few minutes from downtown Montréal -- if proximity is of importance to you, this could be your place. The floors creak at every step, the towels were stained, and the bathroom was dirty. I have to mention that we did check in late in the evening, so it could have been that they didn't have enough time to prepare to host guests, I'm not sure. As for Seb himself, he was very kind and made sure we were properly accommodated.","9"
"Seb's place is very comfortable and clean. The bedroom is big and bright and the breakfast delicious! If you don't mind being a bit further away from downtown, I really recommend it!! There is also a supermarket close by and a Mall and lots of stores and restaurants within walking distances.","9"

"Great stay at Seb's! Pleasant room (AC was a big plus during the heat wave), good location and the hosts were very nice and accomodating. Only minor issue was the parking, as someone had parked in our spot (which we were able to reclaim after a few hours), we had to park somewhere else and the city very strict on parking. Overall we had a great time there","9"

"Berish and his team were very accommodating to our group.  The rooftop is amazing with a great view and very nice furniture.  I heard there was a hot tub going in right after our stay.  This place is classy!   Very nice entryway and felt very safe and secure in our accommodations!
Berish and team were very friendly.  I would recommend this space to anyone!
","10"
"Berish and his team are dedicated to ensuring that their guests every need is taken care of and very quickly, the units are incredibly well appointed spacious and comfortable, finishes are top notch as far as down to the linens and towels not a single detail is overlooked. The view from the rooftop patio is something to experience on a busy weekend in the city. The units are exactly as stated and photographed. This was our second unit in the building on this trip as we needed an extension. Berish and his team immediately  addressed our needs for an extension -as they always did with immediate responses- and worked tirelessly to make the transition to another fantastic unit an absolute breeze. Enjoy the roof top patio with full sun exposure and relaxing large hot tub overlooking the downtown skyline you will not be disappointed in your choice of any of these units. This building is situated right in the center of a fantastic vibrant neighbourhood with no shortage of phenomenal restaurants walk up cafes and patios for days. We could not have had a better location choice or a better stay. Very satisfied customer. These are true Super Hosts. Thank you to Berish and his amazing team for making our 15 day work trip into a mini vacation and showing us what Montreal has to offer when booking with a true Super host!","10"

Probably choose a place closer to downtown/old montreal area. Also the place does not have an elevator which was a slight hassle for luggage. Overall great place, good value for a small group. Would definitely recommend.","10"
"Très joli appartement, très bien décoré au goût du jour. Nous avions beaucoup d’espace confortable au salon pour flâner et jaser entre amis.  Le spa en toiture est vraiment apprécié et la terrasse est un must. Petit point à présiser: prévoyez de vous apporter quelques articles de cuisine spécialisés si vous désirez cuisiner pendant votre séjour car la cuisine est petite et comprends seulement une base de vaisselle et quelques ustensiles.   Aussi le logement possède une porte communicante avec un autre appartement, et l’insonorisation est manquante. Mais pour un groupe qui n’aspire pas à la tranquillité absolue, c’est parfait et ça ne nous a jamais dérangé. Le quartier est très dynamiques, le métro est toutefois a 20 min. de marche et moins accessible. Les hôtes sont très gentils, attentionnés et nous y retournerions sans hésiter. Merci pour ce séjour.","10"
"Great space, in a great neighborhood. Berish and others were very responsive when we had a couple of issues. Highly recommended.","10"

"This condo exceeded our expectations.  We were 6 girls staying for 2 nights.  It was very clean and very comfortable.  All 3 bedrooms had king size beds which made it very comfortable for all of us.  I will definitely come and stay here the next time we are in Montreal.  There was someone always at the front desk willing to help us.  In fact, 2 of you helped us with our bags.  Thank you very much.","10"
"The apartment was perfect...great location, beautifully appointed including a hot tub on the roof top deck which we used in November!  The beds are really comfortable and both bathrooms are shiny and new. Checkin was easy with a reception area to drop our bags on arrival and departure.  James was always available and super accommodating.  Best fruitiere in Montreal is right across the street and the St. Viateur bakery with warm Montreal bagels is half a block away. So many good restaurants in the mile-end, you won't need to travel far for an amazing meal.","10"
"Great place to stay! Very clean and modern. Great location for exploring the surrounding neighborhoods—many hot spots were within walking distance. Comfortable beds and nice linens. The rooftop hot tub was such a treat!","10"
"Clean, great spot! Lots to do in the area, many eclectic restaurants and a few cafes on the same street. The hot tub is an amazing amenity!  We will surely be returning guests.","10"
"I was in room 303. It is on the third floor and the building doesn’t have elevators. It wasn’t that big of a deal to me because I’m still young but just keep that in mind if you are staying with someone who has trouble with stairs. This place seemed to be recently refurbished and looked great however there were a lot of scuff marks on the white walls which again isn’t a huge deal for me, it’s just something they should fix. In general the whole place was great except for two things. The couch in the living room of my room had a lot of stains on it and I am not a fan of that. The other thing is with the hot tube. The host told me the hot tube guy comes 4 times a week, but there was no evidence that he showed up during our stay. The chlorine float had nothing in it and the hot tube didn’t smell good the whole time we were there. All in all this place is good apart from those two things that can be fixed easily.","10"
"Amazing appartament, really nice area, nice restaurants and groceries walking distance.","10"
"Berish and Brian were amazing host for our trip to Canada. Before arriving, any questions I had were answered and recommendations were provided. Communication was fast and location was perfect. The size of the unit was much bigger than I expected. It fit 6 people quite comfortable. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Montréal. The building does not have an elevator as of now, so if stairs are an issue just make sure to let the host know.","10"
"Great place. Well worth it.","10"
"One of the best AirBnB’s we’ve stayed in. We loved this place. Our hosts truly went out of their way to communicate, accommodate & provide anything we needed from start to finish. Free local parking too! We highly recommend this place.","10"

"Nader's home is lovely, everything you would want in a city apartment with a large bath, outside area and comfy bed! 

Nader was in constant communication with us and introduced us to his friends. He gave us tips on places we could check out in Montreal all of which were well worth it!

Defo recommend this lovely air BnB!","10"
"Nader and his partner werr extremely helpful with check in/out times and for local tips. The apartment is perfect for a city break. We cycled in to town every day so found the location great. It's near the old Olympic park which was great to walk around. I really can't thank them enough for our stay.","10"
"Such a cozy little space to make Montreal feel like a second home! Wonderful layout and decorations, I felt like we had entered a bohemian oasis in the heart of the city. Quiet street with rather simple street parking (outside of two weekly restrictions), we had no problem finding a spot to park on the block. First floor location made it easy to unpack and apartment came with heating and AC unit. The bathroom was just the right size with a shower and bathtub. Super comfortable living room and kitchen access made our staycation away from home so delightful. Wonderful backyard space with table and grill to enjoy the warm nights. Access to wifi, Netflix and laundry were great perks. Would recommend and stay again!","10"
"Nader has a lovely home, very neat and welcoming. He was very accommodating and kind, will definitely want be staying there again! Thanks again Nader!","10"

"My experience in Satya’s appartement was wonderful. I felt like my own home. Everything was clean, beautiful and comfortable. My recommendation is 100% effective. ","10"
"Great place. She was super friendly. Easy to find. Good location. Nice room with little balcony.","10"
"The room lets in a lot of light and air, which was a relief from the heat and humidity outside during my stay. The apartment is rustic, cozy, and full of art. It reminds me of my grandma's old home, in a good way. The neighbourhood is low-key and cool, and a short walk away from a lot of fantastic establishments (try out Falafel Yoni). I only had two brief interactions with Satya, and she was cordial and helpful in both.","10"
"It is on the third floor for older people who might want to stay there.  Very quiet neighborhood.","10"
"We enjoyed our stay at the apartment. We didn't get to meet our host but she was available via messages. The apartment is located in a great area with great eateries and convenient transportation. It's not downtown but it was much better for us. There were amazing vegetarian options nearby, and the bakeries were sublime.","10"
"Satya's place is so cute! There is a little porch connected to the room that we used every morning.  She was very nice and accommodating and my sister and I enjoyed our stay. Thank you!","10"

"I spent two nights at Julia's house during my stay in Montreal. She was extremely accommodating, we had everything we needed. The room was very affordable and had an ensuite bathroom. Very cute, quiet neighbourhood with a bus stop to the metro just around the corner.  ","9"
"Very friendly and accommodating host, definitely recommended!","9"
"Beautiful home, close to transport and shopping.","9"
"Julia was very responsive to messages and kindly allowed us to check in early. She cleared plenty of space for us in her fridge and granted us use of her washer and dryer, which was a huge help. Her neighborhood is residential, but a few blocks away the area becomes more industrial, with several power plants and smokestacks. The street was very quiet, although we were awoken by a construction crew doing early-morning repairs to the sidewalk. Overall, we had a very nice stay and would stay here again. Thanks, Julia!","9"
"You get what you pay for. Thinking this was a great deal and not TOO far from the green line via bus, my husband and I booked the bedroom with ensuite bath. The interaction with the host was awkward from the start. My husband and I both heaved our luggage onto the tiny porch while looking for the key in the mailbox. I couldn't see that Julia was inside washing dishes with only the screen door opened. My husband went inside to get the layout while I guarded the luggage. No help from her at all or introduction. Later when we went to the back deck to eat, she repeated 3 times make sure to close the screen door...and seemed befuddled that we would chose to eat al fresco instead of in the stifling living room. The next morning we awoke to banging, drilling, and lots of other noises. Apparently Julia had hired a handyman to do some construction in the house but didn't bother to tell us. Thanks! He was pleasant; just doing his job. We called Julia to see how long he would be there- no response. We opened our windows and the ones in the living room because it was sooooo hot in there and we closed them before we left. The next day we did the same but left them opened because the other tenant was enjoying the air as well. The next morning, Julia removed the cranks so the windows could not be opened. Shortly after that we cancelled the rest of our reservation, but not only because of that issue. She was not accommodating AT ALL!!! It was a chore to ask her for toilet paper, especially after she had a door erected between the kitchen and where she stayed. Also she was dressed inappropriately most of the time in a shorter nightgown ( often with no bra) in front of my husband. She even came into the kitchen wearing just a bathrobe when my husband was cooking, reached across him to turn the vent of the stove on instead of going around. I don't know how she got her rating or her supposed hospitality, but she must have left it in Vancouver!!!!","9"
"Julia was a great host. We had to check in a late at night but she was kind and nice. The price is very reasonable and the roon is clean and tidy. It seemed buses run even at late night at around 1-2am near her place. We had a car so didn't feel difficult to travel around but if you're taking public transit, it will be tough. Also, although the place is located in a quiet neighbourhood, there still constructions going on in the morning so you might feel little irritated. Overall, it was a great place!","9"
"Buena persona, amable y considerada! El lugar limpio y de fácil acceso, parada de Bus a la vuelta de la esquina. ","9"
"Julia was very welcoming and explained us very well how to get to City Center and where to go. 
The room and bathroom is tidy and well equipped. 
The house is in a quiet area and you will find everything you need. ","9"
"Julia is just an amazing host!!! Beautiful and caring, she took care of me and helped me with my concerns!
Her places is wonderfully located, walking distance to food, grocery’s and depaneurs! In a quiet cute neighborhood.
Very clean and comfortable, I’m glad I found this place.
The 187 bus will drop you in front of the house almost, and it’s 10 minutes away from the green metro line!!! Magnifique for long stays","9"
"Julia knows where to go for the transportation passes and can help you find just about anything you are looking for! She was a wonderful host, and I would definitely stay with her again if I was in the area.","9"
"This place felt like home to me. That's how good it was.","9"
"good place to save a little.  note it is in pointe de trembles the most east part. suburbia near malls definately need a car","9"
"It was lovely, cozy and welcoming.
The place was clean and in great shspe.

It is very close to the bus station.

The host, Julia, is very nice and kind. She makes you feel comfortable and right at home.

She is very helpful and tries her best to assist in any way possible to make your stay comfortable and enjoy a.

I will make sure to reserve the same room next time I am in Montreal.

Thanks Julia.","9"
"Location is a bit far from downtown but with a car there is no problem.  Neighborhood is quiet and safe. Affordable.  House is small but ok for the price I paid.  Thanks Julia for letting us stay at your place.","9"
"Everything was fine thank you Julia","9"
"Très bon rapport qualité prix, bien situé, proche des transports en commun pour aller en centre ville et des commerces.","9"
"Julia is a open-minded, a friendly and a very helpful person. The room was clean and everything was as expected.","9"
"Ask Julia if she's taken care of the mold issue before booking. Don't expect the breakfast she provides to involve any fruit, bread or protein sources. There are other guests sharing the tiny house who may or may not communicate with you. There is no dining room table at which to eat food nor is there a desk for using laptops. The beautiful backyard has no lawn furniture and there is junk stacked back there which is unfortunate because the green space could be the best feature of the house.","9"
"Magali was an awesome host. She gave great tips on restaurants and events that were happening all around the city. She really went above and beyond even tailoring additional info for the event we were in town for (Formula One Race). The check-in was super easy and she was quick to respond during our visit. She also gave accurate and thorough information about the space and its amenities. 

The space was comfortable and exactly what we needed since we were spending most of our days out in the city. Her garden in the back is very charming and so is the space. It feels like spending time in a friend's home. We will absolutely be back next time we are in Montreal. 

The location also can not be beaten. Everything you need is a walk away and the train is a half block away making it a great starting point for visiting everywhere in Montreal. The area is very hip reminded us a lot of our neighborhood in Brooklyn. Bars, great food, and cafes. ","10"
"We spent a lovely stay in the Magali's housing. The flat is quite big, and have a little cute patio, where we can have a seat under the sun. Magali gave us a lot of useful informations about the things to know around the flat, but also more global informations about Montreal; it was very helpful for us. We really recommend that flat, which is very well located, from just a few subway stations from the downtown.","10"
"An amazing host,  and a nice and cozy bedroom. The location is the best you can get in Montreal. Le Plateau is a fantastic neighborhood, with parks and plenty of small cafés and restaurants on Mont-Royal avenue. Also the metro is less than 1 minute away,  in 10 minutes you're downtown. Great airbnb experience! I will definitely come back.","10"
"A green and sunny and quiet backyard steps away from lively Mont-Royal avenue, cafes, restaurants, bookshops, public transports… That was awesome! Magali is the best host ever: very helpful and she’s offering incredible tips about the area. Great value, highly recommended!","10"
"This place is awesome. Quick response from host to every questions and more tips and advices on local visits. Great roomates and a very interesting stay overall. I would recommend this stay without hesitation.","10"
"We enjoyed our stay at Magali’s place. It’s conveniently located right next to the metro and there are so many nearby restaurants and bars. Magali was awesome at keeping in touch and letting us know about things to do in the area. Will definitely visit again :)","10"
"the host, vinay, is great. spacious apartment with all needed amenities. I had a group of 7 friends by the apartment and the apartment accommodated and was comfortable for all of us. location great and a quick Uber ride to wherever you need to go. it already mentions this in the listing but there is no AC. keep that in mind for the warmer days as they do heat up the apartment. 
other than that, had a good time in the apartment ","7"
"We booked this place after a last minute cancel by two other hosts and it wasn't actually available.  Have no idea what this is actually like.   The host needs to do a better a job of keeping his schedule accurate.","7"
"My friends and I had a great stay at Vinay’s place. It’s very spacious and has great natural light. The apartment is two blocks from the museum of fine arts and within walking distance of the old city. I would definitely recommend staying here","7"
"Excellent emplacement, hôte très fiable. Équipements très complets dans la cuisine, même des flûtes à champagne ","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 132 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Robert’s apartment was very spacious and easily accommodates four. My experience was very clean, and tastefully minimalist.

The location is unrivaled- a five minute walk from Old Montreal, and truly in the heart of the city.

I highly recommend to anyone exploring the area for the first time.","9"
"Our stay was perfect! No other words. 
The apt is as described, sunny, well equipped, very quiet although super close to the main busy areas! We will come back and book again!","9"
"We had a great stay at Robert's place, the location was fantastic and the apartment was super clean and spacious. Would definitely stay here again. Recommended!","9"
"Robert's place was great and he was very quick with responses! Also, the location was great--I would not hesitate to stay here again. The place was so close to public transportation and an IGA to stock up on food. It was clean and spacious. The internet was a bit on the slow side at times, but we could stream Netflix (there was some buffering required).

There are a few things that I think could be improved. We were two couples staying at the apartment, but we were only supplied with one set of keys and we told we could not have another set. This was very inconvenient for two different couples that wanted to do different things. Also, there was an issue with the oven--we used it to make a frozen pizza, but whoever installed it had left the paper instructions (which were on top of the broiler coil as this is an electric stove) and some other debris in it, like a hard piece of plastic and metal (which were underneath the oven coil at the bottom in the far back corner). We did not see these before we turned the oven on due to their specific locations, so a small fire broke out in the oven. There was no fire extinguisher, so we had to throw water on it. No damage occurred, but it was scary and annoying that no one took these flammable materials out of the oven. Plus there was an awful burning plastic smell after due to the plastic starting on fire. We were lucky the paper instructions did not ignite. ","9"
"Great place, in a great location. Would definitely recommend.","9"
"Robert's place was in a great location to explore Montreal and enjoy the comedy festival.  The home was extremely clean and very spacious.  Beds were a little low but comfortable and we had no issues sleeping.  Air Conditioning worked fine. Having the 1 1/2 bathrooms made getting ready much quicker.  Have the washer\dryer was also nice though we did not use them.  

The highlights like i said was that it was clean and the location.  We were able to walk to most all locations.  We did take metro which was nearby (Champs de Mar 1 Block away).   Street parking was not clear where we could park nearby so we parked at Complexe Desjardins nearby for the duration of our stay.

I would stay here again when we visit Montreal.
","9"
"Robert's place is well located in Montreal, it takes less than 5 min to the next Metro station and less than 10 min to the Old Town. Berri UQAM area, China town and the Quartier de Spectacles are also within walking distance. 
The place is very spacious and clean, and provided a perfect Homebase for a family of 4 during our stay. ","9"
"Wonderful location for city tour. Stylish furnishings.  Washer/drier on site. Bring your own coffee pot or plan on using individual kcup pot on-site.","9"
"Great location! Basic amenities in well maintained condo.","9"
"Great location near Old Montreal and the metro but apartment could be cleaner. Check your towels on check in. WiFi very slow.","9"
"Superbe appartement en plein coeur de Montréal! Je recommande vivement!","9"
"Great place to stay with the subway right across the street which made things extremely convenient.","9"
"Robert's place was just right for our visit.  The location was ideal for traveling by subway and the airport bus was just a couple blocks away.  We would love to visit again, as Montreal was a wonderful city with lots of places to explore.","9"

"Unit was spotless and airy. Well appointed apartment with comfortable furniture and high end appliances in the kitchen, including Nespresso coffee maker. Large main bathroom with separate tub and shower and decent half bath. Lots of space for two couples or small family. Very close to Metro station and within walking distance to coffee shops, grocery store and many restaurants. Close proximity to Old Montreal and all its perks. Excellent communication with owner and unit manager. Highly recommend for anyone needing a home away from home while visiting Montréal.","9"
"trés beau logement , trés bien situé","9"
"Roberts place is in a great location.  However, It could have been cleaner.  With a bit more effort this place could get a much better review from me.","9"
"Very nice, clean centrally located apartment. Luckey Homes did the great job with everything and Robert's communication was good. Highly recommend if you want a spot that's in close proximity to everything and has some old building charm.","9"
"Good apartment, well located.  Basically furnished.  Quiet despite being very centrally located.  Easy access to Metro.  Luckey Homes easily contacted and responded quickly when we had an issue with Wi-Fi (quickly resolved).","9"
"Great spot!","9"
"Robert and his team were amazing! They made sure we were prepared every step of the way. The location is prime for all tourist attractions and for taking the subway. It was exactly what was listed. I wouldn’t change a thing.","9"
"I would never stay anywhere else again! Momo!!!!","9"
"We had a wonderful time in Montreal. Robert’s flat is in a great part of town and we enjoyed the neighbourhood. Apartment is spacious, quiet, and kitchen had necessities for cooking. 
On the downside, we found the beds and pillows very uncomfortable and the wifi did not work well.","9"
"Nice place. very clean. Good communication prior to arriving.","9"
"Robert’s place was very clean and the location to the metro was perfect (less than 5 min walk).  The apartment had lots of light and very comfortable.  The second bathroom was nice to have.  Checking in and out was very easy.  We were contacted regarding check in a couple of days before arrival and again a day before departure.  We would definitely like to stay there again.  I would recommend staying here.","9"

"Propre et très bien situé, il manque par contre d'accessoires, il a fallu aller s'acheter du papier de toilette par exemple, pour le reste c'étais ok","9"
"Lots of open space and great value.","9"
"The location was great and the apartment is located on a quiet side street, which is nice when you’re staying in downtown Montreal.  The price was fair for the location and quality of the home.  The mattresses were incredibly uncomfortable and the beds were so loud, I would be woken up any time my husband rolled over during the night.  Robert was very quick to respond to any of our questions and concerns which was a great benefit especially when our check-in time was changed (delayed flights) and he was extremely accommodating with changing the check-in time to suit our needs.","9"
"Good location and nice space","9"
"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour. Le logement est spacieux, propre et bien situé. Bonne communication. La décoration mériterait d'être remise au goût du jour.","9"
"Grand logement bien situé et tranquille. Prix compétitif. Accueil bien organisé. Toutefois, propreté qui laissait malheureusement à désirer lors de notre séjour.","9"
"Loved staying in Robert’s apartment! Very fair price for the place, which is located in a great spot. Most popular attractions in Montreal are within walking distance, and the place is in close proximity to a grocery store. Having Netflix, along with other apps, available on the TV was a pleasant surprise. The WiFi also worked very well. The only thing to be wary of if traveling by car and looking for somewhere to park it for your stay, street parking is not available, so research parking garages ahead (there are some available within walking distance). I’d recommend doing a parking garage especially if you are staying during the winter season.","9"
"Super zentral gelegene und geräumige Wohnung. Sehr ordentlich und sauber. Die Küche und das Geschirr waren teilweise etwas klebrig. Robert war jederzeit erreichbar und der Check-In verlief reibungslos. Einzigstes Problem: Wer mit dem Auto anreist sollte sich auf massive Parkplatzprobleme gefasst machen. Teilweise muss man bis zu eine Stunde suchen, da man vor dem Haus nicht parken kann und allgemein fast überall am Tag bezahlen muss.","9"
"Location of Roberts apartment was perfect and within walking distance to many areas in Montreal. Check in was easy and the place was clean on arrival. Wifi, tv and all mentioned amenities worked perfect. Would stay again!!","9"

"Very kind host, communicated effectively and provided amenities such as wine, coffee, and snacks. Would recommend.","9"
"The apartment is clean and cozy. The location is great! Alina responses promptly. There’s parking behind the building.","9"
"Alina's place is close to public transportation and many of Montréal's Centre Ville attractions, with a relaxing walk through Parc La Fontaine beginning any adventure. Her home is cozy, quiet, and welcoming, especially for those traveling with a young child (toys!) Parking is competitive and challenging, if you're bringing a car, but would be par for the course to any city dweller. Our stay was wonderful and we'll be back to the city soon, I'm sure. À bientôt!","9"

"Willam is a by far the best host I have  encountered. He is a very nice man and is willing to do anything to make your stay the best stay. His apartment was very clean basically brand new. Amazing place and location. Would definitely stay here again next time!","10"
"This place is at a great location in Montreal. Close to China town and Old Montreal. 

The Host is also great. He replies back quickly to your emails. When I contacted him that the Toilet was broken, he came the very next morning to fix it while we traveled Montreal. ","10"
"Though minimalistic, this apartment suited our needs for this trip. The AC unit is in the living room and even though there is a good fan in the bedroom, if you like to be cold when you sleep you may be uncomfortable. The apartment is on a quiet street very close to Chinatown and about 10 minutes from Old Montreal. ","10"
"Great location, clean, quick responses to questions and any needed help.  I recommend.","10"
"The room's greatest advantage is location. It's very close to Place des Festivals and the Notre Dame. It is very spacious and very clean. It has a full kitchen (full size fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker etc.). Check in was not a problem. William was a very good host, very responsive to questions and issues. Open air parking is available nearby, costing 17 CAD per day (until 6 am of the next day, after that you have to pay another full day). 
On the negative side, the room can get hot in the summer and the A/C provided was VERY noisy (one of those portable units and it was situated in the living room, so had to put it at full and keep door open to cool the bedroom). The room definitely did not feel like home, with very poor/ cheap decoration and furnishing. Bed was comfortable however. Overall a budget option. Would look for something more ""homey"" next time.","10"
"Super clean, 1 bedroom with a pull out couch in the living room. Host left toiletries and coffee for us to use. Internet was fast. 

Location cannot be beaten!  So close to Old Montreal...but you have to walk through an amazing-smelling Chinatown to get there...even though we were full from supper at Gibby’s, walking back to the apartment through Chinatown made my mouth water!  

Highly recommend this place...host came early and saved us a street parking place where we were able to leave the car, for free, all weekend. 

Will definitely stay here when next in Montreal. ","10"
"Zhan and William are easy to connect with, helpful, and respond very quickly. The apartment was sparkling clean, quiet, and very comfortable, especially the tempurpedic mattress. I haven't slept so well in years. The location was perfect with plenty of food, drink, activities, and entertainment right outside the door. I recommend parking your car in a 24-hour garage and forgetting about it for the duration of your stay as it is rewarding to explore the city by foot or by rented bicycle. ","10"
"Basic apartment in a great location.","10"
"Location location location! Perfect place to jump start your Montréal trip. Walk into any direction and you will end up in great sites.  I recommend this to anyone.","10"
"Excellent location and within walking distance of many neighbourhoods. Clean and comfortable, but fairly basic accommodations. Host’s communication with me was excellent. Good value. Would definitely return","10"
"Great location and super clean apartment. Check-in instructions were crystal clear! I forgot the key card inside the apartment, Zhan came back and opened it for me in 30min. Quick responses and easy to connect with.","10"
"Great condo in a great location.  Hosts were always quick in responses and very helpful.  Very happy with this rental.","10"
"It was a great home! It was clean and has a very good location so that you can reach anywhere in the city easily.","10"
"El departamento impecable y limpio, básico pero con todo lo que uno necesita. 
Cerca de todo, podes ir caminando a todos lados. 
La comunicación fue excelente, siempre muy atento. 
Volvería sin dudas.","10"
"This is a perfect place to stay. it's clean and open, there's parking and easy check in. if you head down the street on foot you can reach amazing shopping and restaurants in one direction, the Chinatown district in the other and nightlife everywhere! William would respond to any message within seconds!","10"
"We had a great stay at Zhan's place. It was conveniently located within walking distance to the mall and many other shops/restaurants. Zhan was quick to respond to any inquiries and had great communication throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend this condo if you are looking for a central, clean location that is accessible by walking, metro or a quick uber ride to many different areas of Montreal (Old Port, Downtown, Mall etc). The apartment was tidy and had everything we needed for a pleasant stay!","10"
"This place was in an amazing location. Conveniently located to everything! Loved that we had a parking space. The airbnb itself was very clean and spacious! Amenities such as soap, shampoo, towels, coffee makers, wifi was all available. Will definitely come again. Only thing was Netflix wasn't working and the tv was hard to navigate but no biggie!","10"
"this is the 3th time I am staying in this building, this time in this apt but , as I think any other apts managed by Zhan/William, the experience was more than positive. The place is super clean, spacious, in a modern building with a garage with super easy accessibility, wifi works great. All perfect to me!","10"
"Amazing place, very helpful hosts. The apartment was extremely clean, and the location is perfect. The area is quiet and so are the neighbours. Would absolutely stay there again.","10"

"Great location, within walking distance of downtown core and 1 block from guy concordia metro. Condo was clean and well presented. Matt was easy to communicate with and quick to reply.

Best bang for the buck out there.","10"
"Very nice and clean, just as in photos. Also includes Netflix!","10"
"Great location and close to the Metro which will get you anywhere!","10"
"Matt was a fantastic host, we had some questions after arrival and he was prompt with his responses both via text and within the AirBnB messenger. He was unable to meet us at check-in but his friend helped us park the car and even carry luggage up to the apartment! Parking on site is easy and a welcome amenity in a busy city. We didn't spend much time in the apartment outside of sleeping and getting ready in the morning, but it is just as pictured, clean, bright and enough room for our family and needs. The air conditioning was a welcome reprieve during a hot August and the beds were comfy and cozy. I would definitely recommend staying here and when we return next summer we would consider staying here again if still available. ","10"
"Rapide et simple","10"
"Matts place is cozy. There are two queen beds with comfy comforters and more than enough pillows. He left us 4 clean towels. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need. Theres also a balcony with two chairs. Theres 2 convenience stores right across the street if you need snacks/beer/wine..super close to the heart of dt. Matt responds very quick too. Ubers are very easy to get in the area.","10"
"Thanks","10"
"Great place! Very clean and spacious. Awesome location. The building did have some construction going on, but it wasn’t a bother. The mattress was not the most comfortable thing ever, but I really liked the apartment! A lot of light, full kitchen, and a nice tv!","10"
"We recently spent a long weekend in Montreal.  We had a wonderful time and part of that was because Matt’s apartment gave us a place to come “home” to at the end of each busy day. The apartment is exactly like the pictures.  There were no bad surprises. It is very difficult to find a place in Montreal that has two distinct beds.... not a couch rollout or a blow up mattress.  This has two identical queen beds, one in the bedroom and one in the large living room. Everything was very comfortable and very clean!  Matt was a great host.  Check in couldn’t have been easier and he responded within minutes to everything we asked. I will be staying there again.  Matt, thank you so much! We had a wonderful time.","10"
"Great place to stay. Well decorated, comfortable, and  excellent communication with the host","10"
"We had a great stay at Matt's place.  His apartment is close to metro station. The two beds are very comfortable.","10"
"Matt was a wonderful host. From the moment I booked the Airbnb he was very informative and within the first couple of days of me booking he had already sent the instructions on how to get into the Airbnb followed by some rules. When arrived at the Airbnb it was exactly how it looked in the pictures.  Matt was very helpful when we had a problem turning on the shower i sent him a message and he was at the Airbnb within 5 minutes to help us out! The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The location of the Airbnb was perfect an block away from all food stores and pharmacies and a one minute walk to the metro. Overall,Matt was a great host and I would definitely recommend his place if you are looking to stay a few days in Montreal. Thanks again Matt!","10"
"We were two professionals who stayed at the apartment for 5 nights to attend a conference. The apartment was very conveniently located for our needs (near Concordia University, grocery store, tons of restaurants, and public transportation). It was a safe neighborhood. The apartment itself was okay but spartan (as pictured so true to photos). Two real beds are great feature. No where else to sit though other than uncomfortable folded couch and dining table chairs. Missing some very basic things for any Airbnb place: NO maps, tourist information or instructions on how to use the TV and get into Netflix. Only towel rack was in the shower and NO washcloths or hand towels were provided. We got two large towels each and had to get paper towels from the kitchen to put in the bathroom to dry our hands. The beds were comfortable but don't have top sheets, only a duvet cover. We have to assume and hope that they launder the duvet covers after each guest. It was, on the surface, somewhat clean, although the shower curtain had black mold and there was hair in the drain. There was no stopper for the bathtub.  Items in the kitchen (spatula, fridge, and pan) had remnants of food. The hallway outside of the apartment smelled of fried food the entire week. Really bad smell, which isn't the fault of the host, but may be an issue for some. It was nice to have access to a gym on the top floor. Do not stay here if you are counting on using the garage parking. You need a card to get in and out of the garage, which means you need to park on the street (in a very busy area) on arrival and then departure in order to collect/deposit the card in the apartment. Finally, if a solo traveler or if concerned about safety, be aware that the keys (only one key was left--we had to ask for a second) are left in the unlocked apartment for you to let yourself in after using a code to enter the building. This and parking system are not in the description but should be disclosed before paying so people can make more informed choices. Neither of us would stay here again.","10"
"Very cozy and very good location.","10"
"Matt's appartment is very good and comfortable, very clean and close to supermarket and underground station.  Definitely recommend.","10"

"This is a lovely apartment, perfect for a family of 4, provided the children are pre-teens. The sofa bed may be a little small for teenagers.

Location is perfect, with quick walking access to Vieux Montreal and the the Old Port.  It’s also walking distance from a subway station.

Samuel was gracious enough to let us drop off our luggage at the apartment before 3 pm, explaining to us that the place would not be cleaned at that time. We dropped off our luggage and went exploring.
When we returned after a walk through Vieux Montreal just after 3 pm, the apartment had been throughly cleaned and was ready for us.

Can’t beat the location, and the cleanliness. Highly recommended, we liked it so much that plan to return and also recommend to our friends and family. ","9"
"The apartment was charming, clean, and comfortable. The location can’t be beat. Samuel was quick to respond to all inquiries. FYI, the street parking looks be be for residents only, but there is an affordable indoor parking garage 1 block away. I would stay here again and would recommend it highly!","9"
"Good location. Quiet. Clean","9"
"Amazing loft in Old Montreal. Great Location.","9"
"Amazing location and really cool space! The courtyard was so cute and we loved the shared outdoor space on the roof of the units. It felt very homey and a comfortable spot to come home to after a long day of exploring in Montreal.","9"
"Great location and charming space.","9"
"Very nice stay - clean apartment with the basic amenities.  we met John upon arrival who was very helpful in checking in and very quick to communicate. Located right in Old Montreal with easy access to restaurants and shops nearby.","9"
"Host was excellent and quick to respond to any questions. The loft was very clean and had everything we needed (from toiletries to a fully equipped kitchen). Accurate description of being right in the heart of Old Port - was steps away to everything. 

Also travelling with someone who had multiple food allergies and there was a large IGA within walking distance, where we got our groceries. We brought our own pans, plates etc. and had no issues cooking at the loft. 

Overall a great experience and would not hesitate to stay here again :)","9"
"Great place for a quick weekend away.  We stayed 3 nights. Indoor parking was just down the road and cheaper than we thought.  Close to
The subway. Old
Port area was nice to explore. 
It has everything you need to make you feel at home.","9"
"We met john at check in who was very nice and offered some local places to check out. The place was super clean, very warm (it was -10F that night), and the location can't beat. This place was great overall.","9"
"The loft is so cute and vintage style home. It’s so clean and provided much of the amenities you need. It’s in downtown, Old Montreal area so it’s close to everything you want to see. Samuel and John are amazing hosts. I would come back again.","9"
"2nd stay at this location, I simply love the place, close to all amenities and activities. great place for business or leisure travelers. The apartment is entirely renovated and sparkling clean. The host are very available for any issue or questions, they know the city well. great value, great place, I will book again when I return to Montreal. Thanks again !","9"
"John's place is in the PERFECT location. Just a short walk to all of the restaurants, bars, the ferris wheel and ice skating. The space was stylish and felt very homey. Definitely would stay there again.","9"
"Such a amazing location and helpful with  sights  to see and list of amazing restaurants. Made our vacation better then i could hope for!","9"

"Stayed at Carloine's place for 5 nights with 4 friends. We had a fantastic time. The condo is spacious and clean - a good deal for the price. Getting in and out of the place was easy with Carlonie's instructions, bonus: wifi was fast. It's also in a great area, a few steps to anything you need. ","10"
"We very much enjoyed staying at Caroline's place. Our three daughters found the room with two bunk beds and one double very comfortable (although we had to hang a blanket on the window at night because there were no blinds and the street light bothered them).

The flat has everything you need and is quite comfortable. However, the second bedroom where we stayed had some minor issues. Absolutely nothing on the windows - two full walls facing the street and no door to the living room. When it was -29c at night we could not get the room any warmer than 12c. However, these really didn't bother us much and Caroline will probably have fixed all of this by next time.

The kitchen and family room were perfect.

The neighborhood is the best in Montreal. Fantastic bakery 3 blocks away. St-Viateur bagel just a block away. Excellent grocery store half a block away and open until midnight. Skating at Parc La Fontaine just a 15 minute walk. Metro station is a 10 minute walk away. Lots of shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. We had no problems finding parking the street during the entire 8 days we stayed.

Caroline was an excellent and very responsive host.
Highly recommend.","10"
"Caroline's place was fantastic. It was spacious for us, a family of 2 adults and 3 little kids. It was clear that Caroline has a sense of style as the apartment was nicely done. It has plenty of sunlight, on a quiet street, but also very close to shops, great restaurants, and very walkable to just about everything. We enjoyed our stay very much and would come back. Caroline was easy to deal with and very considerate. She left us a pile of fresh towels, and got us milk, juices and bread. ","10"
"Caroline, the host, was out of town when we arrived, as she had informed us ahead of time.  So she made sure we knew how to get in (extremely simple) and had provided us names of contacts next door.  But Caroline was also easily accessible by phone or messaging and responded immediately.

The apartment is just as described.  It is spacious, airy, full of natural light and comes with all that one would need for cooking, etc.  She even left us some great goodies in the refrigerator!

Location is wonderful - a couple blocks from the Metro, groceries, restaurants, etc.  It was a perfect place from which to explore all of Montreal.  The apartment was relaxing, clean and had a wonderful vibe.

We are so grateful to Caroline for sharing it with us (me, my husband and my 21 year old daughter).  It would be a great place for two couples or a family with small children too.  

Thanks so much!!!","10"
"We really enjoyed our stay in Montreal and at this apartment.  The host left a well equipped home and tourist info for us.  Her friend helped us with any issues that arose. The neighborhood was great!  Down the street from a grocery store and restaurants and a short walk from the Metro.","10"
"Excellent séjour dans l’appartement de Caroline. L’appartement est conforme aux photos et à la description. 
A 5-10 min de marche du metro Mont Royal, au plein coeur du plateau et proche de bars/restau/magasins. 
Dans une rue résidentielle calme et au 1e étage d’une maison typique avec quelques marches d’escaliers à gravir. 
Check in et out facile. Bien décoré et parfaitement propre. 
Grande pièce à vivre très agréable, trois chambres avec lits confortables, une salle de bain et une salle de douche attenante à la chambre des maîtres. Petite terrasse avec quelques chaises. 
Climatisation très agréable par temps de canicule !
Nous n’avons pas rencontré Caroline personnellement mais la communication a été très facile et agréable. Merci pour tout Caroline :)","10"

"Stephane et Sabrina sont des hôtes formidables. Il est facile de discuter avec eux puisqu'ils font preuve empathie et  d'ouverture d'esprit. Accueillants, généreux et très sympatiques, nous avons apprécié leurs conseils et bonnes adresses. 

Leur chambre est suffisamment grande; ils nous ont accueilli avec nos 4 valises.  Le lit est très confortable et nous avons très bien dormir. L'ensemble de l'appartement est très propre. La cuisine est grande et beaucoup d'ustensiles sont à votre disposition. Un supermarché Métro se trouve à 10 minutes à pied de l'appartement. Proches des lignes de bus et métro, il est simple et rapide de se rendre en ville. L'internet est suffisamment rapide et puissant pour tout le foyer. 

Et enfin, les deux petits plus du séjour sont leurs deux chats, Poupoune et Jacob qui sont vraiment adorables et très câlins. 

Une belle adresse que nous conseillons vivement !","10"
"Sophie's place was a real gem: charming Le Plateau ground floor apartment on a small street off vibrant Mont-Royal Avenue. Excellent location, could not have asked for anything better!!! a stone's throw from the Metro station,bookstores, restaurants, cafes, bars and grocery stores. Also an easy walk to the mountain and to the Mile-End. Sophie is an excellent host. She was a great communicator, and made sure everything was perfect. Check in and checkout were seamless. The apartment is stylishly decorated with a lot of personal and artistic touches that make you feel right at home. A beautiful private patio and garden make for wonderful dinners or gatherings outside. Books, music, board games are also at your disposal. Perfect apartment if you are travelling with Kids, or just among a group of friends. Bathroom has all amenities at your disposal. Kitchen is fully loaded with all basics (and even more). cooked many meals there during my stay. a little keyboard made for some fun jam sessions. Thank you Sophie for making my trip to Montreal very memorable. Hope to return to this beautiful place. ","8"
"This is a fantastic home that clearly shows care and reflects the personal style of Sophie and Axel. Our stay was comfortable and having a back yard was great with little kids. We would certainly recommend it for your next family trip to Montreal. The location was convenient. We loved the 'home away from home' feel of the property.","8"
"Charming Plateau appt, extremely well located (bars, restaurants, stores within short walking distance, close to the subway and Bixi station). Very nice hosts.","8"
"Sophie's apartment is absolutely gorgeous, in a perfect location. We also really appreciated how accommodating she was, as we weren't able to leave Toronto until after work, and didn't get in until 11. Just a couple of things to keep in mind if you're booking Sophie's place however:
- the description currently states that there are queen beds in each of the bedrooms, and a pull-out in the common area, but this isn't the case. There is a large bed in one bedroom, a small bunk bed in the other room, and no couch. We were two couples, which made the sleeping arrangements quite awkward.
- the apartment has a very lived-in feel, with lots of stuff everywhere. This makes it feel very homey, but if you're used to Airbnbs that are more sparse, and don't feel like you're in someone else's space, then Sophie's place is not for you. For instance, the bunk beds were in a childrens' room that was tidy, but filled with toys, etc., which along with the bunk beds didn't feel appropriate for two adults to sleep in. It had also been a long time since I had stayed in an Airbnb without a lockbox for the key, or a keypad, so arranging for the check-in felt more complicated than usual. 
I would definitely recommend staying here due to the location and beauty of the building, but I think these are important things to consider if you're thinking of staying here, especially if you're more than two adults. ","8"
"They were really kind,helpful ,hosts.

"Tres bon rqpport aulite prix : le  logement est à 5 minutes du metroRosemont, à moins de 10 minutes du super quartier Mile End, dans une residence tres calme.

"It's a great place were you can stay, so confortable, warm, clean, with a beautiful decoration inside, is near all the attractions of the city, so safe!
Luna and his husband are amazing host, so kind and nice! The hospitality is great and they give you maps of the city, the Subway, recommendations of places to eat, to visit!","10"

"Great place to stay a few days and enjoy the Mile End neighbourhood of Montreal","10"
"Luna and her husband's place has a homey and cozy feel. I enjoyed having chocolate and tea as well as conversations with them. Their place is conveniently a 5 minute walk to the Rosemont subway station, so it was easy to focus on exploring the city. The subway system in Montreal is extremely well-managed, a train comes every 3 minutes. Would highly recommend for people who are visiting Montreal for a couple of days!","10"
"Tout est incroyable chez Luna, la situation , le logement et sa terrasse, l'accueil et la gentillesse des hôtes.","10"
"Amazing hosts, clean, tidy and great location. Helpful and taking care of every detail, very recommendable.","10"
"The best airbnb I ever went !
Luna and her husband are the sweetest people and they have sweet attentions for their guests ! The bedroom is absolutely clean, same for the bathroom and the rest of the appartment. The place is very cute because Luna loves to keep many plants so it creates a peaceful atmosphere. I hope you will have the chance to taste some Iranian food that the couple cooks because it is delicious !! If you have the chance to talk with them, you will realize how great is their culture (they know many french poets and authors) and it was pleasant to talk with them. Luna knows some words in french and speaks english, as her husband. I also enjoyed this place because it was calm and the situation was interesting : on Saint Denis street (where you can find restaurants, libraries, shops), you are 5 min by walk from metro station and like 20-30 minutes by walk to the Mont Royal Park.","10"
"Luna and her husband is really kind and frendly super host. They are welcomed me and helped me to spend comfortable. 
Great hospitality. The room is perfect, I love the beautiful furniture. And nice location. 
Highly recommend it.","10"
"Luna and her husband are very hospitality and informative. I enjoy having tea and chatting with them. The location is very close to the Rosemount station, only 5 minutes walk.

"3 très bon couchage.Petit jardin pour le café.Il y a de la place dans la maison.Par contre en période de grosse chaleur il fait chaud dans les chambres.Florence est très réactive,du sirop d'érable est (Website hidden by Airbnb) vrai place de parking.Quartier très calme.25 minutes du centre ville en voiture.
Satisfait je recommande.","7"
"Wendy offers outstanding hospitality at a very reasonable price. The place is very clean.  She is busy with many projects and tasks, yet she makes the time for friendly chat and is a very caring person.
The one issue is that she does not offer air-conditioning.  Although, I had a ""Hi Tech"" fan.  So if you need 
A/C,  that is remiss.  
All the rest is stated as a great experience and I would stay there again and again.","10"
"Diego was a great host, make us feel comfortable and welcome on his place. The bus stop is a block away, it was really easy to get to downtown. ","8"

"Diego is a very warm and approachable person. A compact and neat apartment  in a safe neighborhood and we had a pleasant stay. The kitchen has almost everything you need if you are cooking. There's a beach not too far and bus stop is within a few block that terminates at the Metro station where you can link downtown/ anywhere within
 20/25mins. I will recommend Diego's place anytime and any day!!!","8"
"The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","8"
"We booked at the last minute but Joe was a perfect host and he gave us nice advices about his fantastic neighbourhood!","9"
"Nous avons réservé en dernière minute et pris un peu Joe au dépourvu. L'appartement était pas mal en desordre mais il a tout fait pour nous donner une chambre en bon état rapidement. C'est un bel appartement bien situé, proche du métro et de plein de commerces,  la chambre est sympa au sein d'une colocation de jeunes.
Je pense qu'elle est plus indiquée pour des jeunes moins délicats que nos habitudes de quinqua. 
Merci en tous cas à Joe pour sa réactivité et son acceuil.","9"
"Joe's place is on a street that has plenty to do and is a reasonable walking distance or a quick drive from whatever you'd like to do. Lots of shops and places to eat nearby! Paid parking on the street, but there are reasonable covered parking lots that are a 20 minute walk or less away. Joe is an excellent host, would definitely recommend!","9"
"Really lovely apartment on a main street, spacious bedroom with window onto the street, comfortable mattress, everything clean and tidy—really nice for a short stay! Great emplacement in the city too, very close to station Mont Royal and in a walkable area. Hosts were friendly, clear, and communicative. Only thing to be mindful of as a potential guest is many steep exterior steps.","9"
"Clean, modern, parking and close to the metro. Arnaud's place is a good value.","9"

"Everything looks exactly like the pictures. My check in  time was at 4 but when I got there early she was happy to give me the key early. The only problem that I had with the place was the AC. There isn't any AC but it was indicated in the listing so I guess that's fine. WiFi speed was good.","10"

"we had a comfortable stay. house is warm and well located. Dan and Winnita are good very prompt and good communicators..Go for it guys... Recommended.. .","10"
"One of the best AirBNB’s I’ve ever booked.

Winnita and Dan were proactive in making me feel welcome and the place itself had the perfect combination of value, location, charm, and more than enough space. It also had a semi-constant breeze that permeates the place because of its location. 

The place itself felt “lived in” and had the touches of someone who had an eye for furniture and design that gives off comfort. I felt at ease in the place immediately.

The only thing missing were in-house laundry and a/c, but it was easy to get around it as there is a laundry place closeby and there is a constant breeze. Otherwise, great place 10/10.","10"
"Spacious and clean. Would stay here again!","10"
"Everything was awesome and much better than what I expected
Our host was very kind and responsible
I'll definitely choose this place for next time","10"
"Winnita and Dan were super organized and responsive. The apartment was bright and clean, as advertised.  We were very pleased and would definitely stay there again!","10"
"Winnita’s and Dan’s place was amazing! They were super kind and left notes with suggestions of places to eat and other useful information about the city. My grandma really liked that the place was super clean. The parking spot was really useful, but the garden gets in the way of carrying heavy suitcases such as mine (that would be like the only downside, but other than that the place was amazing!).","10"
"Appartement très agréable bien situé à 5 mins du métro. Nous avons pu rencontrer Dan le propriétaire, quelqu'un de très sympathique et tjrs prêt à aider.  Il a prévu d'installer un lave-linge ce qui est une excellente idée !  ","10"
"A good place to stay","10"

Thank you so much for an easy and comfortable weekend!❤️","10"
"My children and I (25/17) had a really great time at Winnitas place. The flat is clean and decorated with a special touch of the 60s, the beds are cozy. We felt very comfortable there. 
Winnita was very caring during our stay. She sent us tons of insider recommendations which we enjoyed a lot (especially the beaver tails and the bagels :-))
The flat is very close to the metro station and you can reach the center very fast. I can recommend the flat a lot.","10"

Highly recommended.","10"

"This is a great place to stay, very close to the metro, supermarket and food places. Winnita's recommendations were excellent but we did not have enough time to try them all. The house was super clean and comfortable with great beds and plenty of room. Winnita was in touch to make sure all is ok and really deserves the title of superhost. She is one of the best I have encountered. Highly recommended!","10"

"Winnita and Dan’s apartment went above and beyond our expectations! Not only was the place spotless, but it also had all kinds of unique little touches and personalized recommendations based on the neighbourhood. The apartment was beautiful and spacious, and the beds were very comfortable. Check-in was extremely easy  and Winnita was quick to respond to all of my messages. We will definitely be staying again at our next visit in town!","10"
"I like the stylish apartment with fully stocked cupboards, closets and even a couple board games. Everything was clean and organized. Especially enjoyed the view of the park.

Out of the hosts control but... we all had terrible sleep because the people upstairs were so noisy. They were stomping around the creaky floors and constantly dropping things on the floor until very late at night. Also, they are early risers and made more noise leaving the house.","10"
"The apartment was quite large and very clean. We loved exploring a new part of Montreal. We had dinner on Wellington and went down to Rapids Park on the river.","10"
"We were totally satisfied with our stay.  The communication with Winnita was fantastic.  Parking was a breeze (not always the case in Montréal these days!)  The home is stylishly decorated and comfortable.  We would definitely return.","10"

We will be eternally grateful for everything

Super recommend it!","10"
"Christopher has a beautiful apartment in a great area of Montreal. I rented the apartment for my parents who were visiting and they loved it! Christopher was very easy to communicate with and the keyless electronic lock was easy to use (even for older people). The apartment was very clean and all of the basic amenities were provided, even the added touch of drinks in the fridge and maps of Montreal. The apartment is close to a lot of great restaurants, bars and parks, and not far from the downtown festivals. Would highly recommend this apartment and will definitely book for out-of-town visitors again!","10"
"Christopher was a truly amazing host he saved us street parking and stayed there to give us a tour of the room. He was friendly and really easy to talk to, He had thought of everything down to a pod for laundry and chocolates on the bed side. He allowed us to check out late and was very fast to respond via messaging. It was an amazing experience and when I come back I will be staying here again for sure.","10"
"Super emplacement! Très propre et super service!","10"
"I unfortunately never got to meet Chritsopher in person, but he was so helpful and easy to get ahold of anytime I needed help. if you dont mind a small washroom and kitchen, then I'd totally reccomend this place :)","10"
"Great little spot and a wonderful location.   It’s not a big space for sure, but had everything I needed and Christopher is a great host.  Would definitely stay here again!","10"

"We had a wonderful two night stay at Christopher's place.  The room was perfect, very clean, and had everything we needed.  Christopher was very responsive and helpful with any questions we had.  Self check-in process was very easy.  I would definitely stay again, and recommend it to others as well! ","10"
"O local é excelente, exatamente como nas fotos. Tudo bem arrumado, muito limpo. O Cristopher foi um ótimo host, nos recebeu no check-in e fez todo o possível para nos ajudar. Deixou que guardássemos a bagagem antes do check-in e deu várias dicas do bairro. A localização é ótima, em um bairro muito legal e bem próxima da estação de metrô. Recomendo!","10"
"Absolutely loved this space! Tons of amenities and walking distance to St. Denis and other major streets. Great helpful hosts and a breezy check in.","10"
"This apartment was great! Christopher went out of his way with special touches and the location was perfect. Great local knowledge too with places to eat out etc!","10"
"Stop looking for other airbnb’s. You’ve found the BEST airbnb in montreal.
And here’s why:
-we asked if they could find us a microwave for our unit and THEY DID IT WITH 24 HOURS NOTICE.
-perfect location, walking distance to old port
-parking was pretty easy to find actually
-quiet street and building, safe neighbourhood
-smartest use of a small space.
-immaculately clean
We could go on. Sometimes airbnbs fall short of already short expectations, but this one restored our faith in humanity itself.
Thanks to christopher and the HAWK team.","10"

Parking was a bit complicated but it is free and once you are parked you can walk almost anywhere in the city","10"
"Le studio de Christopher est bien placé, proche du métro Sherbrooke et fonctionnel. 
Nous avons apprécié les petites attentions (boissons dans le frigo, gel douche et shampoing à dispo) et surtout la climatisation! 
Christopher a été très réactif lors de nos discussions. Il nous a indiqué comment venir depuis l’aéroport et nous a donné des conseils de restaurant ouvert à notre arrivée. 
Je recommande.","10"
"Best airbnb ever! Don't look further and just book this. It came with a kitchenette, mini fridge with free drinks and snacks (!), tv with netflix subscription, local tips, a warm bath and a comfortable bed. Better than a hotel room! It was extremely efficiently designed so I didn't think it was too small even though they call it a 'pod'. Thanks Christopher!","10"
"The apartment is small but very cozy. It is well located near the subway station. It is equipped with a stove and a freezer, and for women there is a hair dryer and the shower is very good !!!","10"
"Thank you so much Christopher, your place made our trip perfect. Clean, accessible, comfortable and cozy. We were looking for a place to sleep, we didnt need much space since we had a lot of things to do. The pod was a great place to stay for us. We will come back :)","10"

"Cosy and compact, very bright and clean. Perfect for singles or couples. Great location!","10"
"The POD is a cute little home away from home! The location is amazing — it’s close to a subway station, grocery, and bistro. The place was well-decorated and has great amenities. You really can’t beat the value for the price. Christopher and Charles are great and super helpful hosts! I’d love to come back again soon.","10"
"Recommended great stay","10"
"My friend and I stayed for 2 nights in Christopher's pod and felt very welcome by Christopher, who was very kind, understanding, accommodating, and patient. We were amazed by how many thoughtful touches there were in the place, such as chocolates on the nightstand, feminine hygiene products, good quality shower products, and drinks in the mini fridge. We were also impressed by how much can fit in such an adorably small space. Everything was modern, stylish, comfortable, and peaceful. The location of the house was also beautiful at all times of the day and we never felt unsafe. We wouldn't hesitate to return!","10"

"Clean. Simple. Convenient. Those are the words I would use to describe this place. The place was very clean, the check in process was very simple, and the place was convenient as there are many great places to dine in and pick up groceries /food around the area. The subway was also a 5-10 min walk away. Great stay!","10"
"Very comfortable, clean and convenient. The space is small (as photos show) but had everything I needed with kitchenette, bathroom and some storage space (limited hangers though). Nice neighbourhood and host provided very clear instructions and very prompt replies. I think they did a really great job with this space.","10"
"Very nice location, clean, detailed amenities, and Netflix service. It was a bit small for two people, but still everything was great!","10"

We would recommend this studio to everyone who wants to stay in Montreal.","10"
"The place was way better than we had expected it to be. Because of a very smart and room-saving design, the studio is very comfortable. Given the chance, I would stay there on my next visit!","10"
"Great location and space if you are just planning on sleeping and relaxing as it is a small space as advertised. Perfect for a couple and the location was amazing! Easy to get in and out of apartment and very quick responses from Christopher if needed","10"
"Easy check in and out. Pod was very clean and the local recommendations were great! Would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat!","10"
"Stay at here for 3 nights. Great place! Great location, close to the  metro station, really convenient. Check in and check out is pretty easy. The pod provide almost everything we need and it's clean and tidy. Definitely come back when I visit Montreal again!","10"
"The POD was perfect for my short stay in Montreal with my boyfriend. It was cozy and clean with an easy check-in and check-out process. Simple, yet thoughtful amenities that were provided were a plus (chargers, umbrella, etc.) Christopher was an excellent host, who responded quickly about our question with street parking and messaged to check in and ensure we were good with everything. Location was also great as the POD is in walking distance to several main streets, the park, and a metro station.","10"
"Christopher was an amazing host! We were able to communicate without delay or problem. Check-in Instructions were clear and the location was easy to find. The location is close enough to everything but also far enough to get a peaceful nights rest. Everything was within a short walking distance, including downtown, which was about a 30 minute walk. The closest restaurant and bar were within 5 minutes. The studio was clean and the bed was quite comfortable. We will definitely be coming back and booking in the future!","10"
"Great place. Comfy, clean, I had all I needed to prep simple meals, close to the metro. Thanks!","10"
"Appartement très propre et très bien situé et proche d'un métro.

"First time airbnb-ing and glad it was at Christopher's place. Self check in was real convenient and there was a little booklet of information provided about the neighbourhood and surrounding area and snacks.  The space was super clean and cozy. Nice location and super close to subway which made getting around the city a breeze!","10"
"Really great Airbnb experience! Tended to forget how small the unit was because it was set up so efficiently that it seemed larger than it was. Really friendly and quick service, and the thoughtful touches like laundry tokens, toiletries and recommendations for places to go were really appreciated. Had a little trouble finding parking but was warned about that and the place was within walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants so only had to worry about finding parking once. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy Montréal!","10"

"Do not hesitate to book this apartment! It was even more beautiful in person. Perfect location for the metro and walking distance to any other downtown sights/restaurants! The building was easy to find and felt very safe and secure. The living room was so comfortable for relaxing on cold evenings. Note: the pillows we're a bit firm so if you like something softer, bring your own (the only possible negative I have on the whole place!)","9"
"Clean, central and a warm place to stay","9"
"Very nice apartment for a couple who wants to stay for short term in Montreal.","10"
"Philippe is an amazing host, the best we could ever wish for. He made our stay in Montréal unforgettable. He is very friendly and helpful person, anytime we asked him something he did his best to help us and he gave us great advices about the city as well. His place is very clean and full of special atmosphere and I am sure you will feel at him just like at home. We had there everything we needed and even more. Big advantage is also the location, close to downtown, great restaurants, bars and with the bus connection directly in the front. We definitely recommend Philippe’s place to everyone and we hope to return one day as well. ","10"
"The place looks even better than in the photos - spacious and spotless, in a great, quirky location close to supermarkets and boutiques. It can feel a little further out from downtown, but It's not too long a walk, and there is a bus that stops right outside the apartment. It's very close to Mont Royal and many parks, so it's set in a beautiful location.

Philippe is an excellent host, quick to answer questions and very hospitable. Would recommend to anyone who does not want to stay in a loud, downtown area, but wants to get a feeling of the gorgeous Montreal!

","10"
"Superbe appartement extrêmement bien placé! Propreté impeccable. Philippe a été adorable! Rien à redire","10"
"Literally feels like home!

Philippe is an incredible host who ensures you are always comfortable and you have everything you need - from hangers to detergent, to providing great tips on what to do in Montreal for free!

I have felt at home here. Photos will not do any justice, the decor, cleanliness and amenities available are fantastic!

Would highly recommend!!","10"
"Philippe was a friendly and responsive host from start to finish. The apt and bedroom were clean, stylish and comfortable.  The kitchen is modern and coffee is always available.  The washing machine/dryer  and parking spot were great additions!  A great location in Montreal and quick trip to everything.  A great stay!","10"

"great guy really easy going would recommend easily","10"
"Raphael charges $25 cleaning fee. So at least I expected a clean apartment. Bathroom, kitchen was very dirty. I didn’t use either. I did wanted to boil some water for tea but there wasn’t any kettle or pot. The bedroom has no lock & is right by the main door. So, you can hear people coming & going. The bedroom was hot like a sauna, even with the window open. Didn’t end up sleeping, didn’t even shower. 
I arrived about 9pm, left 8am the next morning. He justified by saying it’s only $17/night but with the cleaning, service etc, it ended up costing $48.02 for 1 night. Didn’t use any of the amenities due to uncleanliness. 
I didn’t meet him only spoke on the phone. He seemed nice & was communicating throughout the night & asked me take pictures of the whatever wasn’t clean because he needed evidence for the cleaning company, which I did & sent it to him. He said he would meet me in the morning, check out the place and refund me the cleaning fee but didn’t show up or responded to my messages. Location is good & check-in was easy.","10"
"Chambre dans un appartement en collocation très bien située car proche du métro, de nombreux commerces, restaurants, de l'université et de l'oratoire St-Joseph. Raphaël est un hôte très à l'écoute et avec qui la communication est fluide. Encore merci pour son accueil parfait et ses efforts pour rendre mon séjour agréable, je n'ai absolument manqué de rien. Je recommande sans hésitation!","10"
"Raphael's room was superb; absolutely a great deal considering the area. Room was very well-kept, and check-in was a breeze. Perfect for any traveller or couple looking for a good place to rest while exploring Montréal.  The metro and St. Joseph's Oratory are steps away, and CDN is a lovely neighbourhood to roam. Raphael was quick to respond and check in on us, and was a great host. Highly recommend.","10"
"Awesome location, this room was in a very convenient spot to allow you to explore Montreal. Room itself is alright, place is not too clean, we actually had to go buy our own toilet paper because there was none and if you're ok with other people stay in same place with you, then you'll be fine here. Really good host, communicative. Only downfall of this place was the cleanliness and how it was unclear about other people also living there. Even so, it was quiet and everyone was respectful of each others space. If you are looking for a place to sleep and semi shower, this place works great!","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Owner did not show up on checking day and was unreachable. We had to find  other sleeping arrangements for the first night. The owner responded to us the second day, only to tell us that he “thought” he sent us the code for the lockbox. When we finally got in, the place was dirty. We had to request that he comes and clean immediately. Later on we realized the bathtub was clogged and that the oven wasn’t working properly. The owner finally fixed everything but it took some time. We made a verbal arrangement for a refund, but it’s been 15 days and no sight of the money and the owner does not pick up when we phone him. We are currently involving Airbnb to resolve this situation.","7"
"Philippe is super helpful, the apartment is very close from the subway and the place is quite and comfortable.
We had a great experience.","7"
"This place is highly recommended for travelers who wish to have an authentic Montreal experience, devoid of noisy tourist traps. The apartment has a living room and patio that overlook Av. Wilderton; the airy bedrooms are facing an alley, so guests have privacy and quiet, while still enjoying plenty of sunshine; the queen-sized bed was very comfortable. The inclusive tree-lined neighborhood (with its synagogues, yeshivas, and churches) is charming, quiet, and safe; it is a 20-minute leisurely walk (or 10min ride on the 161 Bus) to Outremont station where one can find trendy cafes, restaurants, and a Mamie Clafoutis boulangerie; Côte des Neiges, with its many Asian restaurants, is also close by. Eat-in meals are very doable; ingredients can be purchased at the Metro Wilderton supermarket (that is just a 2-minute walk away), and prepared in the the well-appointed kitchen. Guests with cars will find free street parking in the surrounding streets.

Juliana and Rogerio are fantastic hosts. They are not only friendly, helpful and responsive, but also keep their home spotless, while being eco-conscious. If late check-out is required, Juliana and Rogerio will do their best to accommodate. I would not hesitate staying with Juliana and Rogerio again.","9"
"Juliana's place is a gem nestled near the Outremont area. You are about a 10 minute walk in either direction from two amazing neighborhoods and Metro stations, making it a great base to explore the city.  The room is quite big and has all the basic amenities.  The apartment is minimalistic, stylish and comfortable.  Communication with Juliana is great, and Rogerio (the other host) was friendly and enjoyable to stay with. Overall, highly recommended.!","9"
"Thanks very much Juliana!","9"
"Located in the heart of Outremont, this place is a gem for anyone travelling to Montreal. With walkable distance to the metro, cafes, shops, this is a great starting point for getting to know Montreal in an intimate way. Juliana was very responsive with any questions I had and the cohost Rogerio was informative, friendly and very hospitable. The place was clean, well furnished and stylish with a minimalist touch. Highly recommended!","9"
"Juliana and her roommates were wonderful hosts. I needed to find a place for my parents from out of town to stay for 2 nights before better arrangements could be made, and her place was perfect. Cozy, intimate, close to groceries, bus stops and numerous other essentials. They were very understanding of the possible delays of airlines, we were late by almost 2 hours and we still managed to exchange keys. 
Many thanks to the hosts!","9"

"Marine was a unbelievably amazing host. During probably the busiest weekend in Montreal due to Osheaga music festival, another AirBnB host canceled last minute, leaving my friends and I without a place to stay. With the help of AirBnB and Marine, she accommodated a large group of my friends to stay last minute. She responded immediately and was in touch during the entire re-booking process. She and her boyfriend Damien bought us a bottle of wine to welcome us into their home, provided us multiple pairs of keys and checked up on whenever we needed. Best of all, the place is in a super cool and spacious loft, with really fun and interesting decor. I 100% recommend anyone considering to visit Montreal to stay with Marine. I know if I'm coming back to Osheaga next year, I certainly will.

"Good location, clean, professional, very open to accommodating specific needs and requests.","9"

"Marine is a really supportive host and try to solve and address any inquiry asap","9"
"Great location and nice space. The host become abusive over text message when we didn't when left the door locked inside of unlocked and shouted at me in the middle of a coffee shop. Avoid the host shouting at me ruined my day.","9"
"Ran into a slight problem at check in at no fault to our wonderful host, but with their quick responses everything was easily worked out. Marine’s place is decorated with all of her own work which makes it just that much better! A Great place to stay for any purpose in Montréal. Only a few blocks from the Metro and in the great area of Old Port!","9"
"Very stylish place located very close to many activities, sights, and places to eat.  Would highly recommend to anyone staying in Montreal.","9"
"Great and affordable loft space near the heart of Old Montreal. A must stay if you're considering to come to Montreal","9"
"Pros:  Great location, very spacious
Cons: 
They had an air mattress as a bed.  If I had known this I would not have booked this location.  We only had one real queen size bed and one single bed. that only sleeps 3 people.  The air mattress provided was subpar and deflated thus two out of five guests had to sleep on a deflated mattress. The airbnb was not fit for a 5 person stay.  I don't know how the listing is for 7 people.

Checked in at 330pm, but the sheets and towels were not ready. The host indicated that the sheets and towels were still being dried.  I agreed that it was ok, but when I got there, the sheets and towels in the dryer were still wet and I needed to dry them a few more cycles before it was ready for use.   Check in was listed at 3pm, the apartment should have been ready for that time, so I don't see how it is acceptable to have the apartment not ready by 330pm.

Host had provided a solution to us and suggested to give us a discount for our stay, I have yet to hear back from them upon writing this review.

I hope they fix these issues, as the apartment space and location has a lot of potential to be a great airbnb for future guests.

Thanks,
Jet","9"

"Marine’s place is perfectly located on a quiet street in the coolest part of Montreal. Amazing restaurants everywhere and all within walking distance! Marine was so hospitable and arranged everything for our convenience. In apartment itself was bright and private and had absolutely everything that we needed. It made us smile to see that Marine how do even done a little grocery shopping for us and provided eggs and bacon and a few other nibbles! Thank you Marine, Montreal is now one of my favorite places!","9"
"It's too bad. She didi't give food for breakfast. And when I checked in there, they didn't finished bed making and never finished it. We did bed making by ourself and finished dry towels. There is no pocket wifi, just wifi in the unit. I saw､ there are 4 beds. Bud there are just 2 beds. There is no hair dryer. There is only one good thing that it's near the subway station. That's all. 
荷物を先に置かせてくれるということで早めに行きましたが､到着がﾁｪｯｸｲﾝ時間より早かったからという理由でﾀｵﾙやｼｰﾂは乾燥機の中に入ったままだし､洗濯途中の物もそのままほったらかしでした｡結局自分で乾燥機にかけて､ﾍﾞｯﾄﾞﾒｲｸしました｡ﾍﾞｯﾄﾞは4つあると書いてたのに､2つしかなかった｡ﾎﾟｹｯﾄwifi有りとなっていたが､ただの家のwifiのみでした｡朝食の材料付だと書いていたが､初日は大雨という理由で持ってこれなくなったと言われ､その後結局最後まで何も持って来なかった｡連絡しても無視されました｡またﾄｲﾚは詰まるし､床はﾍﾞﾀﾍﾞﾀで汚かったので自分達で掃除しました｡部屋のｲﾝﾃﾘｱがｵｼｬﾚで可愛いかったのと旧市街や駅に近くて便利だったのが救いです｡","9"
"Marine and Damien were fantastic hosts! Four slept comfortably in this cozy, well decorated flat in Old Port. We were greeted by Damien upon arrival and were reassured all questions would be answered at any time (and were in a timely manner). Friendly hosts and location were notable highlights! Would recommend this AirBnB to friends and family visiting Montreal.","9"
"I had to sleep at the floor because the house say was for 6 people but definely is  for 4, the air bed it does work I could slept the two nights and I had a neck injury at the end of my stay, if you are more than six I don’t recommend this place, upon our arrival the bathroom was shi* .. and used, not really clean ! And if you on the rush and leave some dirty dishes they gonna charge 200 us  be careful","9"
"Stylish place and really well located.  No TV or couch, but not a deal breaker.  Would recommend.","9"
"If you are interested in exploring Old Montreal, this is the place to be. Very comfortable, great for cooking too.","9"
"Pro: good location, good communication and basic necessity/cookware was available. Marine was almost always available if we needed help and gave some recommandation for where to go (Website hidden by Airbnb) Con: furnitures and cabinets were all run down falling apart or peeling. The cleaner didn't do a good job and there were lots of random specs of black stuff on the ground and hair on the sink.  Found a few bugs (not bed bugs) on one of the mattress. Had 2 comforters for 4 beds so my mom was really cold even with several of the small fleece blankets provided. No toilet paper and had to drive around the city to find a supermarket that was still open after 10 ( this after a grueling 12hr drive so you'll have to forgive me for being nitpicky), but marine reinbursed us for it. She also gave us a small reinbursement for all the trouble. Half my family didn't stay as they had an one year old and it really wasnt safe for her to be there (kept trying to eat the black stuff off the ground) so we had to pay for a hotel room as it was too late to book any new airbnb at10pm. Check out was a bit difficult as we couldn't find a time to meet and i couldn't drive to her place to drop off the keys, in the end she allowed us to leave it in the house (Website hidden by Airbnb) All in all i would recommand this place to small group of friends who just want a place to stay and didn't really care much about the above things ( and i don't  mean that negatively, some ppl just wants to come and sight see and  party in montreal and this would be great for them) maybe also for small families of 4 with kids older than 5. Or 2 pairs of couple. Marine was nice to try to accommodate my family of 6 but this was just not a good fit.","9"
"Marine was a wonderful host! We had an easy check-in and check-out and she was easily reachable whenever we had a question or needed suggestions for places to go. The apartment was clean, spacious and was perfect for our group of 5.","9"
"Marion was a great host and the apartment was very nice. The location is great too, many restaurants are just around the corner and the subway is only a 5 minute walk!","10"
"L'appartement etait propre et fonctionel! Marion nous a donné quelques conseils sur la vie locale et sa confiture de bleuets est fabuleuse!","10"
"Super appart dans un super quartier typique de Montréal, proche de tout (métro, commerces..). J'ai adoré l'ambiance de la Petite Italie et surtout le marché Jean Talon. L'appartement de Marion a tout le confort nécessaire pour passer un super séjour à Montréal. Les deux petits balcons sont très agréables quand il fait chaud. Je recommande totalement le logement de Marion.","10"
"I really enjoyed the stay at this apartment and definitely recommending to everyone! Zero hassle, very stylish and clean, and amazing (literally can't wish a better) location!","10"
"A clean, airy and sunny space with a cute balcony in front- and a great location!  Thanks for having us! ","10"
"The apartment is located in a very hip area of Plateau with lots of good restaurants and bars. You better check the parking regulations carefully if you do not want to risk gettin a ticket!","10"
"Very nice place and fantastic location!","10"
"Very beautiful, bright, and welcoming apartment. Roger welcomed us when we got there and gave us our keys. He also offered a quick run down of events and other activities going on around the city which was very helpful. The apartment was super close to transit which was very convenient and the cafe/diner right at the corner was delicious with great coffee. The parking was very limited and had to be paid for at a rate of $9 for 3 hours at a time but roger advised that we could download an app and top up our parking from anywhere. There were no public paid parking lots or garages nearby so plan ahead for where you will park if you bring a vehicle. I would also suggest bringing a fan or two as it was hard to get airflow through the apartment to help with the heat at night. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pots, and pans. The apartment was well staged, clean and adorable! Overall we had a great stay and would definitely recommend!","10"
"The moment we buzzed Roger greeted us with a big “Welcome home!”  And that’s exactly what this place felt like! It’s clean but not so clean that you worry about making any mess.  My kids and I felt completely comfortable lounging after a busy day exploring the city. It’s got everything you need onsite for a great holiday get away.  The area is fabulous and we really enjoyed exploring all of the local shops and making most of our meals.  The evenings were spent sitting on the front balcony watching the people walk by. Roger was amazing. We never really needed anything but I knew he was only a text away.  This apartment has a lot of character!  It’s a gem.","10"
"Nice quiet neighbourhood (when no local construction is going on), close to restaurants and parks. Apartment is roomy, and comfortable.","10"
"Lovely spot! Super clean and bed sheets were very comfy.","9"
"Expect a clean, modern, wonderfully decorated & fully stocked condominium. But also expect to pay double + of what is listed. 
Great communication for anything you need. 
All in all highly recommended!","9"
"The place was exactly as advertised - Beautiful, stylish, and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay in a great location! Also great, quick communication with the host. Definitely recommend for anyone visiting Montreal.","9"
"Expérience mémorable, tout était absolument parfait! Vous n'aurez plus envie de rentrer à la maison !","9"
"Hidden one block over from the famous Mont Royal Avenue in Laurier Est, a close walking distance to Mont Royal and other trendy areas. Hides this beautiful gem. 

For a one bedroom apartment this place has a luxurious airy feel with large rooms and a superb outdoor areas for lounging or eating. 

Thanh has thoughtfully considered all aspects of what someone may want or need in an Airbnb and this place also has that homey tweak thrown in. 

I will definitely be recommending Thanh’s apartment/s in Montreal to any friends that may visit.","9"
"The apartment is located in a lovely quiet residential area. It's about 10-15 minutes from the Metro, but there are many great restaurants nearby, as well as cafes, shops, grocery stores, and parks. It is the perfect place to enjoy the hip and charming Plateau neighborhood. The spacious first floor apartment is beautifully decorated in a minimal contemporary style. Everything seems to be newly renovated, and it was very clean. The modern kitchen is stylish, yet functional with new appliances and nice touches like a bonsai tree on the counter, and a Berkey water filter. There is a large deck off the kitchen that was the perfect spot for breakfast or a glass of wine in the evening. We checked in and out very easily, and the host was responsive if we had questions. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic Montreal experience.","9"
"Wow now i know for sure how i want to live one day. The appartement looked even better in real life and i just had an amazing time here. Every little detail is on point and the neighborhood as you surely know is amazing.

The communication is unbeatable and I was just happy to have booked here, if it's free I will book this room again. Thank you Thanh for the communication and Elizabeth for checking in and showing me the apartment :-)","9"
"My stay at Good Living’s was an absolute delight! The space was clean and comfortable (especially the bed and soft sheets) the outdoor space was cozy as well & would definitely stay here again! Thank you for your hospitality.","9"
"Déco simplement parfaite. Petites attentions. Propreté impeccable. Simple, minimaliste, et pratique.","9"
"Just as excellent the 2nd time. Would definitely go back.","9"
"I booked this for the location, the reasonable rate and the on site parking that was offered in the posting. Location is great and apt is v. nice but the posting was inaccurate. The host contacted me the night before (!?) we were to arrive with the wrong dates stating I should book more time, that I was also to pay extra ie over $100 more than the stated price because my husband was coming and yes, there's on site parking, but for yet another fee of $25 a day. 
To sum it up, stay true to your original post, roll your costs into the overall rate and if your going to have your contact who meets us on site give us a map for street parking make sure it tells guests you have to move your car at 8am (!) on a weekday or get towed and that street parking is impossible. Also, if your going to take a picture of our drivers licenses there better be a good reason for it other than 'that's what we do"". I've stayed at many Airbnbs and this was the only one that went a bit sideways.","9"
"Really nice location with local coffee shops and restaurants. Very clean and spacious apartment, much better and more beautifully renovated than the expected. This was my second experience with Good Living's apartments, and her service is always top notch. Will be back soon!","9"
"I absolutely loved this home! It was even better than I imagined it to be and was a real refuge. I ended up spending more time there than I anticipated because I enjoyed how nice and cozy it was. Very clean and nice touches throughout, even interesting books and magazines to read. The design and lighting really make it special. Le Plateau is a wonderful neighborhood, and the location is fantastic. To be so close to excellent restaurants, parks, and boutique shops, and just about a 15 minute walk to the metro... it felt like getting to live a charmed quality of life. I'm looking forward to visiting again!","9"

Encore merci à eux.","10"

"Parfait séjour!","10"
"very clean, kind host, cute dog, great location.","10"
"This was probably my best Airbnb experience to date. Cindy and Jeff are outstanding hosts and should already be called Superhosts. From the early check-in to letting me stay a bit late because of my flight delay, I left with two friends with whom I will definitely keep in touch. The exchange of culture, their indescriptible hospitality and the feeling of home are only the few things that I have cherished from that trip. Thank you Airbnb for making this experience possible.","10"
"Cindy is awesome! She was so accommodating from check in to leaving and the apartment is very nice and clean. A quick drive into downtown.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.",""
"We were extremely lucky to find this spot one day before Osheaga as our other arrangement cancelled on us last minute. We had a wonderful stay. Loft was spacious, stylish, clean, air conditioning was powerful and cooled the entire loft very well. Kitchen was great, nice open living space w/ island and chairs. Hosts were fantastic communicators. Location in Old Montreal couldn't be better, 2 minutes to a 24hr convenience store, 2 minutes from the subway (which is the best subway system any of us have used). Less than 20m from Parc Jean-Drapeau via subway. 24hr Parking was cheap, easy to access and very close. Rooftop patio was great. Good value. Montreal is probably the nicest major city in Canada. Highly recommend staying here, we all would stay again. Driving home I'm already thinking, when can I come back to Montreal!?","10"
"Great location, close to everything at the Old Port. Restaurants, Bars, and tourist spots are within walking distance. Easily accessible by bus and subway as well. Marine is very helpful and responsive as a host. ","10"

"Marine and Damien were exceptionally warm and attentive hosts, responsive to messages, communicative through our stay, and graciously accommodating of our last minute reservation.

In addition to its fabulous location for site seeing and dining, the youthful vibrance of the apartment encouraged a casual sense of comfort, while the cleanliness was to a standard that even my mother would approve of. 

Overall, delightfully easy and enjoyable stay.","10"

The access to public transportation (Jarry metro station) was also extremely convenient. The neighborhood itself is very quiet at night and vibrant with life and full of little shops/cafes during the day. I would definitely book this place over any hotel room in the city!","10"

"This spot was a GREAT find and an even better value. The building is easily one of the nicest on the block. Furnishings seem brand new and are sparkling clean. The space itself is exactly what is advertised: a studio. It served its purpose perfectly for the two of us. Having an in-unit washer and dryer were definitely a plus :)","10"

"Great experience!","10"
"Arthur was an excellent host: smooth communication and neat studio! The airbnb was great, clean, convenient with great WIFI and the best location you could expect in Montreal, at 30 seconds from the closest metro station, at 10 minutes walking to reach Old Port and Mount Royal. The host replies fast and make everything smooth.","10"
"Wedad is a great host and she was so welcoming. 
The place is absolutely worth the money with free healthy breakfast, parking space, and wifi speed had no issue. 
Wedad provided me the best free parking spot right in front of subway station so that I enjoyed exploring the city by subway with unlimited weekend pass. 
And she was so flexible and didn't mind me taking a shower late at night which was nice as I came back home after late evening events.","10"
"Wedad is a charming hostess and very welcoming. Her place borders a riverfront park with walking trails, so it is very quiet. It is convenient to public transit. The basement bedroom is comfortable for two people, but the stairs are steep so not recommended for people with mobility issues. Breakfast is simple and satisfying.","10"
"Wedad est juste géniale, c'est une hôte  qui sait recevoir elle est très chaleureuse !","10"
"It's a great place to stay! It's down a steep set of stairs so not the best for those with mobility issues. But it's a clean bright cool spacious quiet area in a beautiful home! The hostess is a wonderful lady! She even gave us breakfast! It's a wonderful area close to buses and it's really easy to get around! It's a wonderful neighbourhood!","10"
"Jolie maison donnant sur un parc le long d'une rivière, bus et commerces à proximité, calme assuré, nous recommandons vivement Wedad pour son accueil et sa gentillesse, toujours disponible.","10"
"Wedad is a great host.  Parking and breakfast are very nice amenities that she offers that is hard to get in a city like Montreal. Street parking is tricky (you may end up getting a ticket if you dont move the car at the right time). So we felt relieved at her place. If you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown Montreal, but still stay in Monteal, then this place is right for you. My wife and I did not speak any French but we had no problems during our conversations with Wehdad.  We loved her house especially the sitting area in the living room and the porch overlooking the garden. We had no problems with the stairs in the basement. Rather the basement was a lot cooler and it was quite cosy down there.","10"
"Excellant accueil , on se sent tout de suite à notre aise et l'accès à la piscine c'était génial ,surtout avec la canicule de cette fin de semaine","10"
"Positiv: schöner Pool, Garten und Terrasse
Neutral: Das Zimmer liegt, wie beschrieben im Keller, ist daher durch ein kleines Fenster nur bedingt belüftbar. Kofferunterbringung im Zimmer nicht möglich, daher nur für einen sehr kurzen Aufenthalt geeignet
Wedad ist ein kommunikativer Gastgeber, aber Hausregeln erfragen !","10"
"My stay at Wedads pace was great. I enjoyed the pool and her warm hospitality. I didn´t have a car, so it took me an hour to get to the city center, but it was okay for me. It is a great place with a lovely host.","10"
"Verry friendly owner! The room was clean, breakfast was great and there was everything I need. And the apartment was next to bus stop and metro, so it's comfortable to get anywhere you want. I highly recomend this apartment!","10"
"Wedad is an exceptional host. Her place is clean and breakfast is great! Wedad's place is close to the walking trail along the river. She is also very close to public transportation so you can get all around the city. Wedad is a super conversationalist and also knowledgeable about the city and environs. We have stayed there a few times and have always enjoyed it.","10"
"First thing is Superhosts are that because they do things right to make a guest's stay pleasant and comfortable. Wedad went beyond that for me and I felt like I was actually in my own home for 11 days. Beside that, the space is clean and comfortable with enough privacy for anyone who needs it. The amenities can't be beat because everything I'd need in my own home was offered for my use.
Some of the perks are the porch and terrace, a pergola and the heated pool beside it, plus the well-kept yard is right beside a green belt that contains gorgeous trails by the river for walking, sitting, or cycling. Also, Wedad is very personable and easy to have a conversation with if that's your thing. The value for the money was excellent!","10"
"Wedad is a fantastic hostess. She is very warm hearted and her spacious and tidy house is filled with her warmth and girlish joy. She has great depth and substance as well. Her house is in a quiet place with lots of nature around, and at the same time close to the bus stops that take you to the center. I stayed two weeks with her and am thankful for that time and I highly recommend staying with Wedad.","10"
"The place is great and clean","10"
"We had a great time at Mike’s place. The location was amazing since the building is just steps away from Cote Saint Catherine street, close to Berri subway station, and in the middle of everything. The only downside was expensive overnight parking fees in the neighborhood. Mike was always available and very responsive and accommodating to our needs. He even had provided plastic ponchos which came really handy in the rain showers. My family and I enjoyed our stay and appreciate Mike’s hospitality.","10"

"Overall the place was very nice for my family. My father said the main bedroom had a very comfortable bed.  We used a spare mattress  in living room for our kids.     It is really a great place just to sleep as kitchen and dining area not great space or equipped for cooking meals - but the good thing is that it is located close to many restaurants and stores.  Amal was a great host and tried to be very accommodating.  There were some issues with what was advertised in error by Airbnb. I would say that You definitely need to pay for underground parking as parking is atrocious near the building.","9"
"L'appartement est très bien situé: à Deux pas du CHUM et à deux pas du quartier latin. Le lit est confortable et bien qu'on soit en plein centre-ville, tout nous apparaît calme et on dort bien. 
Bien qu'un peu cher, car le stationnement n'est pas donné, je recommande cette place.","9"

"Amal was a great host and was super responsive. We couldn’t find keys when we reached at his apartment and he was super cooperating and responsive. He helped us get keys in no time. I would have loved if there were more cooking utensils since I was traveling with my 2 year old daughter but that night not be too important since Amal’s apartment is at great location very close to myriad restaurants. His apartment is cutely done. Thanks Amal!","9"

"Amal place was what we were looking for. Convenient locations, stylish apartment and parking garage was a plus as well. It was close to everything in downtown Montreal. My only concern was the lack of cooking utensils, as we were cooking Christmas dinner, but with all the amenities around that was a minor detail. Amal was very responsive with all of our concerns. We will definitely recommend and stay again at Amal’s place.","9"
"Amal must be the most responsive host we ever had. We never met in person but he provided timely support nevertheless. The location is very good especially if you are new to Montreal; it’s walkable everywhere. One thing to note is the the unit is advertised as 1.5 bath. I understood that to mean 1 full bath and 1 half bath. This was not the case; the unit only has one larger than normal full bath. Perhaps there’s a a difference in American vs Canadian understanding of 1.5 bath! There’s indoor parking FYI for additional cost but it’s worth it especially in winter.  Thanks for being a good host, Amal!","9"

L'appartement est situé au coeur du centre-ville, est proche de tout et il est facilement accessible en métro ou en bus. Petit problème avec la android Tv box mais rien de bien grave. J'ai bien aimé mon séjour et j'y retournerai si l'occasion se présente. Amal est très réactif et peut se présenter si vous avez besoin d'aide à n'importe quel moment. J'ai eu des petits problèmes d'ententes avec amal au début pour une demande spéciale, mais croyez moi que si vous êtes réglo avec lui, il le sera tout autant avec vous. Je n'ai manqué absolument de rien et il était à notre disposition pour qu'on puisse profiter d'un agréable séjour.","9"

"Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour dans cette agréable maison. Accueillante, confortable, décorée avec goût, propre, elle est idéalement située à proximité des avenues commerçantes Mt royal et Laurier et du parc Lafontaine. Conforme à l annonce cette maison est très bien équipée et parfaitement adaptée pour de jeunes enfants (chaise haute, vélos, poussettes, jouets pour le bain, le jardin, jeux de société, livres etc.). Le jardin est un vrai bonheur. Bref, mes enfants étaient vraiment ravis et nous aussi. 
Caroline et Thierry sont des propriétaires chaleureux, disponibles et prevenants, un gentil présent nous attendait à notre arrivée. Ils ont sincérement contribué à rendre notre séjour très plaisant. Merci encore à cette sympathique famille. Nous venons régulierement à Montréal et nous avons désormais trouvé notre adresse! ","10"
"This house is amazing!!! It's a beautiful and large space, very clean and organized, exactly as in the photos. The location is right downtown, walking distance to all the restaurants, bakeries, shops and the metro. The backyard patio is ideal for relaxing. 

Caroline and her husband are very welcoming and communicative. They helped us with directions and advice on things to do in the area. Perfect hosts!!!","10"
"This was our first experience using airbnb and we were thoroughly satisfied. Caroline welcomed us with an extremely clean house that accurately matched her description on the website. Questions we had prior to arriving were answered quickly by email. She also gave us nice recommendations for restaurants in the area. The Plateau is a wonderful place to stay when in Montreal as you will never go hungry and will always have something fun to do and in walking distance. I would highly recommend staying at their beautifully renovated house and when we return to the area I will be contacting Caroline once again. You also may find a nice surprise in the refrigerator waiting for you. Thank you again for sharing your house with our family.
The Brooks'","10"
"This is probably one of the nicest houses you'll stay in. It was spotless, and quite large. The house has everything you could possibly need and is located in a great neighbourhood. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
Thank you so much Caroline for the note, muffins & fruit, it was so thoughtful. ","10"
"Location, location, location.  5+ stars.  If you are traveling with children do not hesitate to book this house.  It is equipped with everything you might need and forgot to pack.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to cafes and restaurants easily.  There is also a very nice park a short stroll away.  Even though it was very close to all the attractions of Le Plateau the house was very quiet.

The interior of the house is nicely furnished and exceptionally clean.   The bedrooms are set up such that the smaller children's rooms are directly across the hall from the master bedroom.  There is also a screened-in sitting/ play area off of the master that provided some extra space.  The backyard has a perfect little play-set and a romantic lighted table and chairs.  We picked up takeout for lunch and had a nice quiet break in the afternoon before heading out again to explore further.  We were able to secure parking on the street either directly in front of the house or at most a couple of spots away.  

The hosts provided us with some great tips for shopping and dining.  They even secured us a reservation at the fantastic restaurant Le Quartier General around the corner.

This home is a great base for your stay in Montreal.  It really is a perfect spot.

 ","10"
"Excellent stay overall. The hosts were very accommodating and communicable. The place just as good or better than the photos, very clean, and comfortable. The location is excellent, close to many restaurants, shops and transit. Highly recommended!","10"
"Caroline was an amazing host. She was incredibly responsive and very accommodating. The house is amazing and in a great location for a weekend in Montreal! Couldn't recommend this place more highly.","10"
"We loved staying here and I can't recommend this place enough!
Located in the best area of Montreal, this place is absolutely huge and has everything one requires for a comfortable and peaceful stay. It is on a residential street so it is nice and quiet, but very close to lots of great shopping, restaurants, parks and beautiful buildings. Short 5-10 minute walk to the Metro.  Being just two of us, it was way more space than we needed...but no complaints about that! 
It was wonderful to have a place like this to retire to in the evening after long days of walking around the city. Clean and modern, bright and airy, yet very homey. Very comfortable bed in the master suite with lots of natural light all throughout the entire place.  Beautiful modern bathroom with a lovely tub. I wish I had more time so I could have used it, but the shower was fantastic. Also a cute little powder room on the main level was very convenient. The design and aesthetic were consistently beautiful throughout the entire space, which really added to the peaceful serene ambiance. Absolutely beautiful and well equipped kitchen, looking out over a nice outdoor space with yard and deck. 
 Although we did not meet Caroline she was extremely helpful and easy to get in touch with. Checking in and out was incredibly easy, there was lots of information left for us, as well as a bottle of wine, which was immensely appreciated when we arrived.
The only complaint I have is that I was not able to stay there longer, we did not want to leave!  I will definitely keep this place on my list for future trips, it really is the perfect place to stay in Montreal!","10"
"La maison était parfaite, telle que décrite! Très propre et accueillante, les propriétaires avaient laissés des petites grignotines faites maison pour nous. 

Pour une famille, cette propriété est idéale - 2 chambres d'enfant décorées de façon très créative. Ma fille de 2 ans était aux anges, il ne manquait pas de jouets! 

Nous avons eu quelques demandes de dernière minute et Caroline et Thierry furent très flexibles. 

L'emplacement est idéal - un havre de paix en plein coeur du Plateau. Tout est accessible à pied. 

Vraiment, une location idéale, merci beaucoup!","10"
"Nous avons loué la maison de Caroline et Thierry pour organiser notre photo-shoot.

This was our first airbnb experience and we will definitely do this again!

"My group of four friends enjoyed our stay at this beautifully designed home.  In the very convenient area of Plateau-Mont Royal, with plenty of shops, restaurants, and the Metro station about 10 min walk away.  The home is spacious and comfortable.  Everything was as presented in the listing and photos; if anything, it was even more impressive in person.  The kitchen, as promised, was a great place to cook in.

Caroline was very accessible and welcoming via email prior to and during the stay, although we did not need to take advantage of her offers to help with reservations or information.  Her kind note and complimentary bottle of rose was most appreciated.","10"
"We could not be happier with the hospitality we received.  Such a great experience beginning months before our arrival.  This residence is in one of the best locations in Montreal if you are looking for a true local feel.  Tons of space for a family with very comfortable furnishings, great style, lots of attention to detail.  Close to so many restaurants, shops, and parks.  For a first time visitor to Montreal the advice that Thierry and Caroline provided was invaluable.  Great home base to relax and explore the city.  ","10"
"This was our second stay at Caroline and Thierry's home in Montreal. It was exactly perfect for our family.  The location is very convenient for walking around the neighborhood. There are many cafes and restaurants in close proximity.  The house is well equipped should you choose to eat in.  The back garden is nice spot to relax and enjoy a break from the action. Our children loved having a  ""playground"" in the backyard.","10"
"We loved our Le Plateau house, the perfect size and location for our family of four. Our two kids (ages 8 and 6) loved having the swing set out back, the bunk bed in one room and the trundle bed in the other, plus the toys and books, even in French! We liked having the piano to play on, too!

The kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, and laundry room are all well equipped (as befitting a European-style kitchen, the coffee maker is a French press), and the giant windows facing out back from upstairs and downstairs are fantastic. We appreciated having the gas grill to use out on the deck and the private back yard (though our kids were likely a bit noisy for the back yards all next to one another!).

The location could not be better! The house is on a quiet residential side street in the hip neighborhood of Le Plateau--it felt like French Brooklyn. It's a very short walk to the Mont-Royal metro stop and on the way home from the metro it's easy to stop at the supermarket en route back to the house to pick up whatever you need for dinner. There are also tons of low-key options when it comes to eating out, especially with kids. There are two Second Cup locations within blocks from the house--like a French Canadian Starbucks and our go-to coffee break spot. Also, there are two playgrounds nearby, and one is next to a public pool.

Having the metro nearby was excellent as nearly everything we did was no more than four or five stops away. We drove up via New York State and we were a little nervous about city street parking, but in the summer at least it was always easy to find parking on days you had to move the car for street cleaning. (It is definitely easier than in New York City!)

We so appreciate being able to use this family house as our home for a week and would come back again!","10"

"This is a very clean and accommodating space. Nice to be in the top floor as the wood floors squeak. There was only occasional noise from neighbours, which was not really bothersome. The sofa bed in the living room is better than a standard pullout sofa but not as good as a decent futon. It’s better for kids than for the heavier body of an adult. The location is at the North end of a great stretch of street with lots of restaurants and bakeries. Nice to be close to a subway. The kitchen has basic supplies, like cutlery and dishes, salt and pepper. There is a great little grocery store a block south. This place provided us great value for our dollars.","10"

"Great little spot. The pull out was confusing at first but Anh was very quick to respond with where the instructions are. There is space for 2-3 cars for free parking on weekends in front but you have to look between the signs OR there is free parking by the VW dealership a few mins away. The balcony door locks automatically so be sure not to get locked out. Other than that, great spot. Quite clean. There are two flights of steep stairs to get up but they’re not too bad. Great communication and had everything we needed for our two nights for 4 guests.","10"

"We stayed one week in Anna-Isabelle's place. The place has been recently renovated in a very modern and practical style and all amenities are new and in very good taste. It is a bit noisy as you hear the neighbours and the street so best to sleep in the back bedrooms if you are sensitive to that. The location is great, 5 minutes from the metro station and an ""épicerie"" (small supermarket) and lots of great restaurants around. Small outdoor market with organic products on Sundays at the metro station. We had a few questions about the place and it was very easy to communicate via (Hidden by Airbnb) with the host.","9"

Their place is conveniently located in Lasalle close to the waterfront. The home has a contemporary design yet preserves its historic feel. We didn’t have a chance to enjoy their backyard but it truly looked like an oasis with beautiful flowers and a lush garden. 

The room was spacious and has lots of natural light. It was nice to have the bathroom in the bedroom which truly made it feel like our own private suite. Loved the little touches in the room like the phone chargers. 

The highlight of our stay was hands down Marie-Jose’s breakfast! There were homemade muffins on the table, freshly brewed coffee and a selection of teas, a chia yogurt concoction (amazing!), delicious cheese and apple crepes, and home cultivated honey. My mouth is still watering from the breakfast. 

Marie-Jose and Jacques made us feel right at home and part of the family yet we had our space to come and go as we pleased. I honestly can’t wait to book with them again for our next stay in Montreal. Merci, merci, merci Marie-Jose et Jacques - À la prochaine!","10"
"Venez découvrir l'ambiance Stirling. En trois mots: réconfort, hospitalité et convivialité. Des hôtes d'une grande générosité dans un décor majestueux, digne des plus belles maisons de Montréal. J'ai ADORÉ mon séjour chez Marie-José. Allez expérimenter par vous-mêmes, coup de foudre assuré !!!","10"
"Thank you so much Marie-José! My Dad and I had a great night. The room was so nice and clean. Marie-José welcomed us when we arrived and showed us around the house. Will recommend this place and will come back again for sure. Merci","10"
"In Summary: everything was perfect! Really nice, lovely and clean room with your own bathroom, super nice and lovely hosts and great breakfast.   Getting into the city by car within 20min and to the airport within 10-15 min.

More facts: You can use the living room, if you like to watch TV, the two cats are really sweet, the host have great recommendations for activities in and surrounding Montreal. The room has many lovely details like charger for smartphones, cookies, a little fridge and a folder with restaurant recommendations (the ones we tried were all excellent) and tourist informations about Montreal.

I can fully recommend it!","10"
"Staying here was such a treat! From the fresh smelling linens, home made cookies waiting for me in my room, to the thoughtful healthy breakfast- which included honey from their garden hives. This airbnb feels more like staying in a boutique- hotel within a gorgeous home. Can’t wait to return to Montreal to stay here again.","10"
"A beautiful room in an elegant old house , very comfortable and well equipped with a very nice shower. Very good value for how nice it is. I didn't meet the hosts (only their daughter) but they were friendly and easy to communicate with. Highly recommended for a good location close to the airport.","10"

"Très bon accueil. Excellent séjour.   Merci!","10"
"Marie-José was such a gracious host! She offered such a warm welcome and incredible hospitality. She helped me find the nearest train station, made a delicious over the top breakfast and extended such kindness the entire time. The house was absolutely lovely, even more cozy than the pictures! I would highly recommend Marie-José and Jaque's place to anyone staying near Montreal! 11 out of 10!","10"
"Fantastic experience, one of my favorite hosts.","10"
"This place was very well furnished. The decor was very beautiful. The hosts were amazing people, very warm and friendly. They provided a lot of advice on Montreal foods and attractions.

"We loved staying in this 5* hotel quality room and en-suite. We were only there for one night but the hosts were very friendly, helpful and flexible. The whole house is stunning and very convenient for the airport. Highly recommended!","10"
"Yaw and Anyele were the best hosts. They always responded promptly to messages, and answered all questions. The room is super cute and the little chalk board with my name on it made it even more special. I really enjoyed my stay and I had the best night sleep. You can't beat the price if you're looking for somewhere quiet but still close enough to all the action. I highly recommend this airbnb. Thanks again Yaw and Anyele! :)","10"
"Yes! The living room in Yaw and Anyele's house is as beautiful in real life as it is in the photograph. Among other surprises that this amiable couple from Ghana have to offer is a full line of personal care products free of charge! This includes a toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash. The cottage is a little small, but there are 2 bathrooms and the kids are well-behaved. The Pierrefonds location is not ideal, but the place is located only a 5 minute walk away from St. Jean's Boul. and the 470 bus. Yaw and Anyele are a glowing example of West Island hospitality. I strongly recommend their place.  Rating: 4 1/2 STARS  (OUT OF 5). (Website hidden by Airbnb) Ralph Cohen.  Montreal, Quebec.","10"

"If you like a clean and nice place like me, just choose Yaw & Anyele rental, you will not be disappointed. I really loved this rental that I wanted to extend and extend my stay.
The house is big, the washrooms are clean and well furnish, the living room nice with its big dining table, the rooms are clean and well furnish. I was finding myself into a hotel of 5 stars (*). Finish, the neighborhoods are safe and quiet too.

Bon rapport qualite-prix!

"Lovely, comfortable apartment, easy communication and check-in, and conveniently close to restaurants and pubs. The bed (a foam mattress on the floor), was, surprisingly, honestly one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept on (and I am picky about back and neck support). I also liked waking up to the industrial view from the loft bedroom.","10"

"Truly a beautiful and sunny space! Patricia’s home was exactly what we were looking for. Check in and check out were simple using the lockbox, we were able to book on short notice and they responded right away. 
The upstairs bedroom was significantly warmer than the rest of the loft but overall we had a great stay. Would recommend staying in the spring or summer to take advantage of the private terrace.","10"

"Place was alright. when we got in it smelled so strong of air freshener to the point where we considered leaving because we both had a headache. We ended up having to open the patio door in the middle of winter to air out the place.
There was a burnt out light over the kitchen table. The main couch almost broke the first time I sat on it and was extremely uncomfortable. Building is a bit run down

Overall the stay wasn't terrible but for the price I could have stayed in a much nicer place.","10"

"AMAZING location - -great space, very clean and well kept - easy to get to and to check-in.  We parked on the street no problem but paid parking nearby if you don't get lucky.  Mike was very responsive and helpful.  Only bummer was smoke (pot or tobacco or incense not sure which) from neighbor that seemed to makes it way into the apartment - was not unbearable or constant  but annoying.  We opened windows briefly but was very cold outside so couldn't do that for long.  I would, however stay there again!","10"
"Great place","10"
"Mike's place is in an excellent location, walkable to everything you need. Place is a bit smaller than it appears in the photos.","10"
"I stayed at this apartment for 13 days. The location was amazing, 3 minutes walk to the metro and within a minute's walk to local coffee shops and convenience stores. The apartment was bright and spacious. Mike was great and responded to any queries promptly and efficiently. As I was there for an extended period of time, I would have liked more cooking utensils, but this is a perfect for a short term stay. Thanks again Mike!","10"

"Très bel appartement, spacieux, propreté impeccable. Il est très bien situé, dans un endroit à la fois calme et proche de nombreux commerces. À 10 minutes du centre en vélo. La propriétaire est fort sympathique et les chats des voisins de bonne compagnie.","10"
"Appartement très charmant et très agréable à vivre. Il est idéalement placé à Montréal avec ou sans voiture! On peut finalement se garer sans trop de problème ou bien découvrir le mille end ou le Plateau à pied. L'accueil est vraiment très sympathique de la part d'Alphee. Nous avons profité de ses herbes aromatiques de son petit jardin. Avec nos deux enfants, nous nous sommes sentis comme à la maison. Je recommande vivement ce logement sans hésitation.

","10"
"We cannot say enough good things about Alphee's beautiful apartment. Bright, clean, modern and well located near many great restaurants, markets and parks. The apartment is equipped with fabulous touches such as a huge jetted tub, an high quality music system, an espresso machine, and excellent AC- a rarity in Montreal! The back garden is a lush oasis to relax in and enjoy an al fresco meal. The surrounding neighbors are friendly yet give plenty of privacy.

Alphee was very responsive, nice, and easy to communicate with. She made our entire family, including our children, feel welcomed into her lovely home.  We would stay there again without hesitation. Thank you so much for your hospitality, Alphee!","10"
"Our stay was wonderful and very welcoming, thanks to this lovely house. It truly felt like a home. Our 2 young girls loved playing with all the toys. Everything in the home was as described and the location was superb! 

Merci, Alphee!","10"
"alphee est super disponible, bonne communication, son appartement est génial, super bien placé et calme, tous les commerces se trouvent à proximité, c'était le top. nous avons adoré.
merci à alphee.","10"
"My family visits Montreal every year, and I can honestly say that Alphee's home is the best we have stayed in Montreal partly due to the fact that we truly felt at home. I came to find that we share similar interests(such as our love for plants!) and a healthy, balanced lifestyle. Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful space with us. We can only hope to stay in your home again when we visit next year and finally meet you and your sweet daughter!","10"

"Merci pour votre réactivité! En effet, j’ai pris cet appartement en urgence le matin même. Étant avec mon petit chat, je devais absolument arriver avant 15h. Ils n’ont pas hésité pour m’accueillir directement. Le nettoyage a été fait parfaitement malgré le manque de temps. Je les  remercie pour leur professionnalisme :) 
L’appart est vraiment chouette, près du parc Lafontaine. On s’y sent très bien.","9"
"Appartement agréable et bien situé. Olivier est un hôte réactif et attentif.","9"
"Très beau appartement, bien entretenu! La déco est très très chouette! La communication a toujours été A1! Bien que le métro ne se trouve pas à côté, nous n'avons pas eu de la difficulté avec les déplacements. La seule chose qui serait à améliorer serait la connexion WiFi.. Pas la plus vite, cela nous a empêché de faire une petite soirée relax Netflix, mais nous avons profité autrement :-)
On le recommende!!!!","9"
"I spent three nights in this apartment, and liked it very much.
The location is near a big park, and it took me about 15 minutes to walk to the nearest metro station. A supermarket can be reached by a short 3 minute walk.
Entrance to the apartment is from a street level door, and the apartment is one floor up, reached by a staircase inside the building.
The apartment itself felt a bit like home. The wooden floors are creaky and a little bit worn in places, but not a problem at all, at least for me. There are also a few minor drops of paint on the floors, but again, not really a problem. The furniture is generally comfortable and the bedroom mattress is relatively firm. I really appreciated the light blocking curtains and blinds in the bedroom. I was not bothered by traffic noise from the street during my stay, and found the place quiet. What I also really appreciated about this apartment is how clean it was: Absolutely spotless! Also, communication with my host was flawless! Needed a hairdryer and got a reply immediately. And the hairdryer was delivered very soon after. And I got the same fast response and delivery when I couldn't find a can opener.
All in all,  I was very glad to stay in this apartment, and impressed by my host's swift and positive replies to my requests.
I would be glad to stay in this apartment again the next time I vist Montreal.","9"
"Le logement était très bien et très propre tel que présenté dans l'annonce. Les clients que j'avais relocalisés dans le cadre d'un tournage ont été satisfaits du lieu. Quant à moi, la communication avec l'hôte fût exemplaire et il fût très accommodant. Merci Antoine!","9"

The apartment is cute, warm, clean - I´d stay there again! I had a few questions before my arrival and during my stay and he replied immediately. Such a great find!!! Merci.","9"
"Olivier's place is very quiet and it is not too difficult to find free parking. The only thing I wish it had is a washer/dryer.","9"
"We stayed at Olivier’s apartment to celebrate NYE in Montreal for about 5 days and it was perfect for my husband and me. We are from SoCal so we never get the cold temperatures that Montreal has so it was really nice that Olivier provided the apartment what it needed to stay cozy. The location was great as well pretty close to Schwartz which we ate at like 3 times. The communication was great and Olivier was always quick to respond. Thanks for letting us celebrate 2019 at your Plateau place.","9"
"Je suis restee chez Olivier, 15 jours : Du 16 fevrier au 1er Mars. Ce sejour fut une catastrophe, de pire en pire chaque jour. L'appartement d'Olivier n'est pas du tout adapte pour rester en Hiver. Des que les temperatures etaient froides, plus de chauffage: 16 degres dans l'appartement alors qu'il faut -20 dehors !!! Pour resumer mes aventures, hormis, ces 15 jours passes dans le froids (ce qui est deja insupportable): Une trappe au plafond etait ouverte sur l'exterieur, les rideaux de la chambre tombent, la douche fuit, la television ne marche pas... Bref un sejour des plus catastrophique. J'ai bien sur demande a quitter les lieux plus tot mais Olivier n'a pas souhaiter, malgre les circonstances, me rembourser.. Tres mauvaise exprience, je ne le recommande pas !","9"
"Great location and fully equipped! Perfectly clean! Overall great stay!","10"
"C'est un beau grand logement avec 3 chambres comportant de bons lits confortables, de bons électroménagers et Nacima a le souci de rendre notre séjour agréable. Lors de notre passage, nous avons trouvé cela quelque peu difficile de cuisiner avec le peu d'accessoires à notre disposition, ce qui pourrait facilement être corrigé.","9"
"L'appartement correspond bien à la description. J'y retournerais.","9"
"Carlos y Lucien son excelentes anfitriones, amables y respetuosos quienes hicieron todo lo posible para asegurarnos una estancia agradable. Mi esposa y yo vinimos a vivir a Montreal y ellos fueron de mucha ayuda para nosotros. El apartamento es limpio, amplio, e iluminado. Lo mismo la habitación, en la que llegamos a sentirnos muy cómodos teniendo en cuenta que fue una estancia de 16 noches. Los espacios comunes son bonitos y confortables. El hospedaje está ubicado cerca de una boca de metro, y a otros sitios de interés turístico como el jardin botánico, el parque olímpico y la torre de Montreal. 100% recomendable.","9"
"To stay in Carlo's apartment was unforgettable experience. It is beautiful, very comfortable, conveniently located. We loved everything about it. Carlo is amazing hosts, welcoming and very helpful. So, this is great place. Economical and excellent for the savvy traveler. Internet was very fast and overview from terrace was great. Thank you!!","9"
"Un endroit très propre et magnifique avec une vue exceptionnelle ! Par contre j’ai crue que c’etais un appart complet , le titre m’a un peut tromper .
Autre seule point pour ma part j’ai trouver un peut compliquer de me rendre la première fois ! 
Malgré tout cela je crois que se sont des hôtes de bonne qualités et vrt très propre ! Endroit a1 !","9"
"“My Friend and I spent one week at Carlose apartment. It was beyond our expectations. The hospitality of Carlos and his partner was wonderful. The Apartment was super clean, specious with amazing view especially in the sunrise or sunset. I was looking for a 5 -star hotel to relax for at least 2 nights. But I was blessed to spend a week of relaxing in this 5-star luxurious apartment for lower price”.

"I wish I had spent a little more money and gone to a motel because this was an absolute nightmare of a house. There was dirt literally everywhere and it looked like the common areas, bathroom, and room hadn’t been swept in ages. The bathroom had grime and hair on the sink, floor and in the bathtub. The room was supposed to be two queen beds but instead was one twin and one queen and was super cramped and uncomfortable. The room was also supposed to have a “view” according to the listing but all we saw were the neighbors’ backyard as well as a huge pile of random trash. The soap dispenser in the bathroom had soap so diluted with water that we ended up using hand sanitizer to clean our hands. The listing also said it was close to downtown but it ended up being a 45-1 hour trip to downtown one way (bus and then train), and it was super inaccessible. Overall I’m really disappointed because the listing looked lovely and instead it ended up being super gross and really uncomfortable for all of us. Additionally there were a ton of people there and the lock on the door for our room was super broken down and could easily have been opened. I’m also pretty sure that mould/dust in the house is the reason my friend got sick the first night we were there.  

I have stayed in cheaper places that have been nicer than this and it was so awful to have this trip ruined for us. Our friend group was meeting for the first time in over 8 months and it was such a let down as the host seemed really nice and down to earth. We definitely learned our lesson to do more research and to plan further in advance to book a better place for New Years in the future.","2"
"It was really nice staying with Bee. The location ist perfect and the room is very sweet.","10"
"Staying at Bee's was great and she is a lovely host!","10"
"The location was exceptional!
We bought a three day metro pass and didn’t need it once we arrived at her place because everything we wanted was within walking distance, from museums to parks to restaurants to shopping. Bed was comfortable, room was cozy, and there were pastries in the room when we arrived.","10"
"Bee’s place was purely amazing! Well located and exactly as it shown on the pictures. Bee is really welcoming and her place is beautiful! I recommend it !
We will surely book it again when we will come back in Montreal soon!","10"
"Bee is very friendly host and had some great recommendations for coffee/ eateries/ bars. The bed is king size and very comfortable. Her place is in a very central location close to cool neighborhoods  and walking distance to downtown.

"Alex’s place is right in the heart of the city of Montreal, with limitless things to do around and easy transportation via metro, although most things are walking distance. There is an IGA right around the block which was convenient for food shopping and beer. The place was very clean, comfy bed with balconies on both rooms. Alex’s place also had a wii-U which was fun to play in the morning when it was raining out. Alex was also a great host who answered any of our questions right away and gave great local tips. We had a great time, thank you Alex.","10"

"This place is great bang for the buck and a quick stint to anywhere in the city. 

Three beds are A1 so no one is left pulling the short straw, Roku is a nice addon. 

Middle grounds between olympic village and downtown.","10"
"We had a nice stay at Melanie’s air bnb. The place was clean and well decorated. The electric key pad for the door is very convenient as you can check in and out when you please. The place is fully equipped as well with everything you need if you want to cook or do laundry. My only complaint is it takes roughly an hour to walk to downtown or it will take 40 minutes by public transport. It is roughly a 12 minute drive by taxi or Uber to Old Port. We ended up taking an Uber every day. I would not say the air bnb is in the “heart” of Montreal. It’s also a $45 cab ride to the airport. All that to say, for 3 bedrooms it’s a great deal.","10"
"Marco and Melanie were fantastic! Fast communication through the whole process and the place was amazing! Would definitely recommend. Less than a 10 minute Uber ride to downtown and three bedrooms!","10"
"We had a great stay at Marco & Melanie’s place. The space was clean, nicely decorated, well stocked, and it fit 6 people very comfortably. Getting to downtown Montreal was very accessible from this location (10 min uber, 40 min metro). We also enjoyed exploring the neighborhood of Hochelaga and there were some fun spots in walking distance. Melanie was quick to respond with any questions we had. Thank again :)","10"
"Perfect place to stay,  recommended","10"

"Emplacement proche de tout.  Check in facile.  L'apartement est propre et d'une bonne grandeur - 3 chambres à coucher mais pas de salon.  J'ai bien aimé qu'ils fournissent le café et lait/crême ainsi que le savon, shampoing, revitalisant.  Si vous êtes sensibles à l'odeur de cigarette, cet apartement n'est pas pour vous.","10"
"Awsome place","10"

"A very cozy & comfortable stay. The place is even nicer than the pictures. It is quite spacious and the host is very accommodating. The only thing that I would mention is that the walls are pretty thin so voices and noises travel. Other than that, it was a fantastic time. I would definitely recommend!","10"

"Beautiful place and perfect location! Would definitely stay again","10"
"Amazing place, amazing location.  Will definitely stay here again.  Kevin was a great host.","10"
"Pros: amazing location, super comfortable beds, very clean, thoughtful nespresso machine and any kitchen supplies you'd need, great space to hang out in, easy check in, friendly staff. perfect location in Old Montreal with a ton of great places to eat and hang out near by. 

Cons: we booked room 402 but we were checked into 304, ultimately it was fine but we had specifically planned some events/gatherings based on the room that was pictured (i.e. big table for a nice dinner, lots of couches and chairs for movie night), so we had to adjust a bit. 

There was also a door in one of the bedrooms that led right to a hallway where people were often loud when checking out in the early morning, or kids playing in the hall. The windows downstairs were also drafty, which isn't ideal for a Montreal winter. 

All manageable, but just little things that we had to work around.","10"

"Gabe was super helpful and quick to respond when we had trouble getting in to the location, and we really appreciated that.  Heads up - the upstairs neighbors have very young children, so there was a bit of noise early in the morning.  Our stay was fantastic, and everything was clean.  The space was beautiful, well-decorated, and had everything we needed.  Thank you, Gabe!","10"

"My family and I stayed here for 4 nights. The place was perfectly sized, clean, fresh linens and enough towels. My kids loved it and I am still thinking about how comfortable the “cloud like” king sized bed was. The distance to the city was just right. Once we got our bearings and didn’t need uber anymore we found that navigation back was easy. 10/10 would stay here again.","10"

"Great host , great location and comfortable apartment.","8"
"Nice location. Nice rooms. Host was efficient to communicate with. We used the 2 bedrooms and had my older daughter sleeping on the living room hide a bed which is more suited to sit on it than to sleep on it. If you want more place to sleep, I suggest you bring a air matress.","8"
"Check-in process was less than ideal. Was told to go to someone's apartment (not the host) to pick up the keys. When we arrived at the Airbnb's location, we had a very difficult time finding parking despite the host telling us that there is plenty of free parking available. The building itself was under heavy construction (wires hanging down from the ceiling in the lobby, clutter in the hallways, etc...). The unit's floors were dirty including in the bathroom, the bedsheets were stained, we found hair in bedding, the heat was very high with no way to control the temperature, and one of the kitchen cabinet doors came off entirely when opened. The mattresses can barely even be called mattresses as they were extremely uncomfortable with minimal support. The pillows were as flat as flat can be (either very poor quality or extremely old). Needless to say, we did NOT enjoy our stay despite the host's ""Superhost"" status. Would not stay with this host again.","8"

"Thanks Moss and Yan for a clean and comfortable stay at your airbnb. Your stylish home is sure to be the wanted reservation for many other young adults in the future. Some things to note could be the somewhat unstable toilet and shower door the does not close fully. Please also note that despite the wonderfully new TV, there was no audio output. Overall, a great stay and would be happy to return. Location is also very convenient and close to bank, grocery store and parking lot. Great small home for groups of 4, clean and modern and reasonably priced.","9"

J’avais un jeu de clés et j’étais complètement libre de faire des allers-retours. Le dernier jour j’ai même pu laisser mes valises plus tard que prévu. Je recommande !","10"
"Ayca was a gracious and generous host, she offers airport pickup for a small fee which was most convenient. 

The room is spacious with a large queen sized room, plenty of closet space, and lovely lighting.

You have your own bathroom (!) and overall the house meets the description very well.

She is an amazing woman, their daughter is lovely, they have a calm and cute (non-shedding) white dog. The house is kept very clean and Ayca even offered me breakfast on both days.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Almost more like traveling to a good friend's home with warm hospitality and kindness. We became great friends and will be sure to keep in touch. 

As a single woman I was very pleased with the safety of the neighborhood not to mention to West Island area is beautiful and there is a bus connection to downtown as well. 

Highly recommend!

"Phil’s space was very nice. Clean, comfy, thoughtful touches etc. If you are planning on booking a parking spot, be prepared to have a hard time getting to your spot. Make sure you don’t drive a truck! Very tight parking, had to make a 3 point turn at every corner. It was also a one way so cars are coming in and out. Other than that, the stay was good and would stay again. Great location, and many different things to do around the area.","10"
"So worth it! The place was beautiful, clean and very convenient. Liked all the small touches, you’ll see what I talk about when you book the place. We live in Montreal and wanted a little escape for the weekend and that’s exactly what we got.","10"

"Second time staying in one of Phil’s apartments, loved every single minute of it. His response time was 10min or under.

Can safely say I will always try to book one of Phil’s places before any others when staying in Montreal from now on.

And the floor to ceiling windows were wonderful to overlook the city on a nice snowy day. We woke up every morning and made coffee using their espresso machine. After a long walk, would sit in the soaking tub with a glass of wine. And they had very comfortable linen robes available. I would 100% stay here and recommend this apartment to everyone.","10"
"This is a very lovely and calming space. We really enjoyed the amazing deep soaking tub and a beautiful view of the St-Patrick’s Church from the kitchen window. The location of the loft is perfect for touring and dining. The kitchen is not fully equipped for cooking, but there’s so much to explore just walking distance from the loft.

"The place was not only beautiful and in a great central location, it was also spotless! The owners answered all my questions very quickly and with great detail: they seemed to be available for their customers at all times of the day. In the living room, there was a booklet with information regarding restaurants, places to visit and attractions nearby. The jacuzzi was one of the best amenities of the building: it was a great relaxing and quiet spot. I have nothing to add or to suggest, as the Oasis was truly the perfect romantic cozy getaway.

St Catherine Street is only a block away and it is full of bars, restaurants, shops and so much more! Having such a big place in downtown is rare. It was perfect for our large group. The host is very accommodating with check-in and check-out. The place is super clean and beautiful. I would definitely stay here again!

"El departamento es muy bonito, tal cual las fotos. Es ideal para una familia grande, la cocina está super equipada ( aparte de qué hay dos), es muy cómodo tener dos lavadoras y secadoras, Nathalie fue una increíble anfitriona que cuida cada detalle y fue muy comprensiva en nuestra hora de llegada y salida.

"Melanie and her roommate, Alex, were friendly, thoughtful, and kind hosts. Just wonderful. Both took time to help orient us to the apartment, neighborhood, and city, and were available in case we had any additional questions. They were also generous and flexible with our schedules and graciously shared the apartment's amenities such as the washer/dryer and dishwasher. We can't thank Melanie & Alex enough for the experience of having our own, quiet and homey, pied-à-terre while visiting Montréal. We felt like welcome guests rather than clients.

Melanie's apartment is charming and has an excellent view of the city and the Plateau from the relaxing rooftop garden, which is a delicious bit of private luxury before or after a day out in the city. It's close to streets that conveniently connect to nearby East & West neighborhoods via rue Mont-Royale and rue Sherbrooke. (A Bixi bike station off Mont-Royale is likewise convenient.) Yet it's in a small quartier that also has restaurants, grocers, shopping and nightlife in it's own right, and is conveniently near green areas, such as Parc La Fontaine, Picine Laurier, the Olympic Park, and the parks on Île St. Hélèn via la Pont Jacques Cartier, which one can walk or bike across. (The view of the St. Lawrence & the city from this bridge is worth it alone.)

In short Melanie's apartment is wonderful and in a perfect location to experience the best of Montréal. 

I hope you also get to experience the good life from this perspective! 

Thank you again, Melanie and Alex! Wishing you both the best!

"Melanie was very welcoming throughout the trip and told us about some of her favourite places to go. She let us drop off our bags and explore the city while she got the place ready for us. The description of the place is very accurate and the entire place feels homey.  The neighbourhood is peaceful and there are a ton of restaurants, shops, bars and places to buy alcohol. The metro subway station is also very close by. The private roof terrace is absolutely amazing and I can definitely say that we spent most of our time outside on it. I miss this place already!","10"
"The condo is one of the nicest places we could imagine to stay at for a weekend. It is spacious, beautifully furnished and has a magnificent terrace to have breakfast or a drink in the late afternoon. The location is very convenient with many bakeries, grocery stores, bus stations etc. close by. 
Although we inquired on very short notice, Melanie was open to host us.   She is a very kind, easy-going person that gave us many good tips on where to go out, have brunch etc. Melanies roommate is also a very nice person but we only saw her shortly once.   ","10"

"We were late getting into Montreal but Melanie was very accommodating. She answered all of our questions promptly. Her apartment was clean and exactly as listed. Melanie even surprised us with some bakes treats. Overall we had a great experience and Melanie was a great host.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"If I return to Montreal with another couple, Melanie's place would be perfect! Her apartment is a big 2 bedroom place with a DYNAMITE rooftop patio.  Who would say no to coffee and the sunrise on the top of a builiding? It is close to a busy street with restaurants, bars, shops, and the subway and the bed was veeery comfortable.  Thank you, Melanie!","10"
"We had a really fantastic stay at Melanie's apartment. The apartment is big and comfortable. There is everything you may need in the kitchen (and even more !)and this roof top terrasse (with view on Mont Royal park and Downtown Montréal)  is just exclusive. After a 20kms walk during the day you 'll loooove having a Belle Gueule beer on the terrasse :-p
Concerning the neighborhood, Le Plateau is a trendy and hipster place, calm and typical with many restaurants, but be careful it may be a bit far from Downtown (metro Mont Royal is 5min walk from Melanie's apt).
Moreover we actually reserved the room at the very last minute and arrived very late but Melanie was very accessible on the AirBnb app and we didn't have difficulties to get the keys. Take it easy and enjoy your stay at Melanie's apt !","10"
"Melanie was a great host. She provided what we needed and made the stay comfortable.","10"
"Melanie was very easy to communicate with. The apartment was spacious, comfortable, and in a trendy location. Street parking was easy to find, which was a plus! We very much enjoyed Montreal.","10"
"Apartment was clean and with an open-model. Lots of space and light. Melanie was very accommodating and kind. Thanks again!","10"
"Appartement mignon et confortable. La terrasse sur le toit est super sympa!","10"
"Great area of Montreal to see and do different things, easy transportation, the three day metro/bus pass is a must for short stays.
Melanie was responsive to questions we had. Condo isn't air conditioned but is nice and airy and our stay was comfortable through four of the hottest days of the summer so far.","10"
"Melanie's apartment is located in a great section of the Plateau and easily walkable to a lot of shopping, stores, restaurants, and the metro. The roof deck is phenomenal, and in my opinion, is what sets this listing apart. You will certainly want to spend your evenings out there, and if you like to cook, plan to have some dinners up there too! We also didn't have any issue finding parking around the corner, which was a plus. Two recommendations - Le Pegase is around the corner and is BYOB, and Les Co'Pains d'Abord has phenomenal croissants in the morning for breakfast.

One caveat, as others mentioned, is that the apartment is not air conditioned. This is not that big of a deal during the day, but the bedroom does not have a portable AC unit either, and that made sleeping quite difficult all three nights. The only way that we could sleep was with the windows wide open, but that let all the light and noise from busy Ave Papineau into the room, and it was still pretty hot at that. The second bedroom is dark but has no windows to open and thus was too hot. We also only had one fan, which did not serve to cool down the room enough. I imagine that this is not an issue in the fall and spring, which are probably the best times to rent this apartment since you will still be able to use the roof deck but will also be able to keep the windows closed at night. Also please note that when we were there it was swelteringly hot, with nights in the upper 70s and high humidity. I imagine that cool summer nights may not be too bad either. We did know about the lack of AC when we rented the apartment, so it wasn't like Melanie was not honest, but if you don't like humidity or light/noise when you sleep, you may want to wait until the fall or spring to book this place.","10"
"Une très belle adresse et un appartement tres mignon","10"
"We did not get to meet Melanie, but her apartment was awesome and in a great location.  The rooftop was a great addition even though we did not really spend any time up there!

We were mostly out of the apartment during the day time, but I slept more in those few days than I have in weeks.  I would definitely book this apartment again!
","10"
"Très bon emplacement, et très jolie appartement, nous n'avons vu personne a l'entrée ni à la sortie c'est dommage... ","10"
"This place was great!  Quiet at night.  Located right next to a main thoroughfare with shops, restaurants, bars, and the Doggy Cafe!  Would stay here again.","10"
"It was very good, really cosy and comfortable. Good attention from Melanie and very nice answers","10"
"We enjoyed our stay with Melanie. She was super responsive and really the sweetest, very helpful and offered a lot of great suggestions. It really is incredibly close to all of the amenities, while still being incredibly quiet and comfortable. Quick (10 minute) walk to the metro which made traveling around the city a breeze! Very much worth the value. We loved it. 

The only thing I would say to be aware of, is parking. As the listing says, it is completely restricted from 4-6pm for rush hour. But there is also another restriction of 60 minute stays between 9-4. There was parking available on a side street, so we didn't end up leaving our car there as we noticed the parking authority out and we didn't really want a ticket. ","10"
"Transit is so easy to access, Melanie was a great hostess & Montreal is a beautiful place to be. 10/10 would stay there again. ","10"
"Mel was great! Place was perfect for two people. Lots of street parking but cannot park between 4-6pm for rush hour. No troubles parking on side streets. Melanie was informative and helpful with any questions we had. Busy street but the noise was not a concern. A lot of steps up to condo, not an issue for us but could be for some. HDMI only for TV use. Full internet access. Overall a great experience. Thanks a lot Mel!","10"
"The location is terrific - central to so many wonderful places to eat and walk! The apartment was very comfortable - there were 2 of us (and our dog!) but the apartment easily sleeps 4.  I felt very much at home and perfectly comfortable.  Thank you Melanie!","10"
"We didn't get to meet her in person, but she was very friendly and helpful. She went out of her way to make sure we could comfortably complete our visit and not be rushed during checkout. A great place to say in a good location with a great hostess. ","10"
"This is a very convenient place if you want to explore the Mont Royal or Plateau area.  The beds are comfortable - but I might bring my own pillow if I return!  There is a lovely dining table with four chairs to eat at and the kitchen was equipped well enough to make basic meals.  For the price this was a very nice place to spend a long weekend.","10"
"Great location close to everything but some amenities and essentials listed weren't provided and the extra occupancy fee didn't cover the extra essentials needed for more people. Host was slow to respond to questions about the house.","10"
"Appartement original et bien situé.","10"
"Melanie's place is a really charming place to stay in the plateau/Mont Royal area. All the amenities you need for your home away from home are available - beds are comfy and clean. It can get a bit hot during hot days but windows offer good cross breeze. The rooftop patio is very cool as well. Those who might not like stairs too much may have a hard time, but the location and features were great!

Lots of restaurants, shops and boulangeries are nearby. Mont Royal metro station is <10 min walk away, or a few mins by bus. 

Melanie was amazing - she offered lots of helpful info and advice for our stay and trip. She was very communicative and quick to respond to any of our inquiries. Thanks for a lovely stay, Melanie! If ever we are in Montreal again and you're still an Airbnb host, we will certainly look you up! Merci beaucoup!","10"
"Le logement est très bien situé. Nous avons trouvé facilement la rue, qui est à deux pas de l'avenue du Mont Royal. Le quartier ne manque ni de bar ni de restaurant. Il y a plusieurs supermarchés à proximité.
L'appartement est bien équipé. Il y a de l'espace pour s'étaler ! Les balcons sont vraiment sympas pour profiter d'un apéro (si le temps le permet!) 
Le rooftop est génial! 
Juste un petit point d'amélioration, le canapé était malheureusement très sale... L'idéal serait de le changer ou de mettre des couvertures afin de recouvrir les housses.

Mélanie a été très disponible et arrangeante, particulièrement le dernier jour! Merci pour ta gentillesse !!!
Nous recommandons ce logement pour découvrir Montréal :)
","10"
"Melanies home was clean, well equipped and comfortable. The roof top terrace was and added bonus. There are several means of transportation very close by, great bakeries and shops within walking distance. I would definitely stay again.","10"
"Melanie's place was perfect for our weekend in Montreal.  The location off of Mont-Royal was ideal and the rooftop patio was superb!","10"
"It was great. Nice place. Close to lots of restaurants and bars. Rooftop patio is icing on the cake","10"
"Awesome place in MTL everything you'd need and more (Roof Top Balcony is EPIC !!)","10"
"Melanie's home is what you'd expect from reading the description and seeing the on line photos.  Melanie was quick to respond to my messages and allowed a quick drop off for my bags before venturing on a walking tour.  The home was clean but the bathroom may have benefited from a deep around the shower and floor clean.  Melanie's home is what you'd expect from reading the description and seeing the on line photos.  I just didn’t realize (my own lack of research) that the home is quite far from many of the attractions I had planned to visit but my friend and I walked each way a couple times and then took a quick 15 minute subway ride as well.  I would recommend Melanie’s home to anyone but for myself, I’d prefer to stay closer to the downtown area only for the convenience.  Thanks Melanie!","10"
"All went well.","10"
"Had a great time at Melanie's. Stayed with another couple and the apartment was big enough with two rooms. The rooftop deck is nice, just be sure to hold open the latch until it fully locks open. If you close it, it automatically locks. We were locked out on the rooftop for a little bit until the couple we stayed with came back to let us in :) Great location with many options of restaurants, bars and shops!","10"
"Great space, comfortable beds
 Getting in and out is simple. The neighborhood is fun and walkable, and it's about $16 Uber to get downtown. We had a fantastic stay!","10"
"Un bel appartement très bien situé et très confortable. La terrasse sur le toit est également très agréable.
Dans l'ensemble c'est un très bon logement.","10"
"Melanie's apartment was absolutely fantastic. Spacious, open, washer and dryer, and the rooftop patio was incredible. Beautiful views of the city and the perfect place to drink wine with friends. Would come back here in a heartbeat.","10"
"First time using Airbnb and I hope all in future are this pleasant. Melanie always responded promptly and was always very helpful. Would definitely stay again.","10"
"Appartement très bien situé et superficie très convenable pour 4 pers. Hôte très disponible par messages. A recommander","10"
"What a great place to stay, very close from everything. The beds were comfy and the place is spacious, with a cool terrace on the top.The place was clean and all the instructions for the house was clear. Melanie was responding quick to my emails who was great. I will go and stay there again. Thanks Melanie","10"
"Melanie was a perfect host, she lets us arrive at the time we wanted and accepted my cat!  Everything was clean and beautiful.  The apartment is well located, near an Intermarché open 24/7, really convenient!  I definitly recommand this airbnb, and the kindness of Melanie!","10"
"A lovely apartment in a very cool area in Montreal! We didn't meet Melanie but she was great at messaging back quickly and was very helpful! We would definitely recommend this place.","10"
"Melanie is a great host and her place is exactly as described. The location and rooftop were absolutely amazing! I would definitely stay here again!","10"
"We really enjoyed our stay, thanks, Melanie!","10"
"Melanie's place was easy to find, minutes away from anything you need. The rooftop is really great, the view is spectacular!! It was clean and communication was quick. I would recommend this place.","10"
"The place was nice, the area was good. The only problem was the bathroom that needed a deep clean :/ ","10"
"Great location, nice exposed brick walls and roof-top terrace, relatively quiet (on a main street, so expect a bit of traffic noise in the room, but not too bad. The place was generally clean with a few exceptions in the kitchen.","10"
"Melanie's place was the perfect location for my trip to Montreal. It was a cozy and spacious two bedroom apartment that felt like home after the first step inside. 
The space was really clean and fresh, I appreciated all the little touches that made a difference ( throw pillows on the beds, extra towels and amenities. 
Melanie was also readily available by text message with any of my questions about where to go, which was so kind and helpful!! 
Thanks so much for everything :) 
We will stay here again if ever we make the trip to Montreal in the future.","10"
"Can’t say enough about the apartment, excellent location, space, and comfort. Within walking distance to plenty of great restaurants, and we liked the neighborhood as well. Melanie was great at contacting us and made checking in a breeze, would come back if in Montreal again.","10"
"Melanie was a great host. She made the check in and check so easy! She was also very quick to respond to my messages.

The space is great for a weekend visit. The apartment was clean, with the exception of the bathroom, could've used a nice scrub with CLR mold and mildew remover. The shower is also very tiny. It was a little claustrophobic. 

The bedrooms were comfortable and clean. Although the bedroom facing the street has sheer curtains, so if you like to sleep in bring an eye mask to block the light.

The kitchen  had all the essentials and was clean.

The apartment is actually a 25 minute walk from the metro. A little inconvenient when the weather is bad. But it's a quick Uber ride.

The location is great. Plenty of restaurants near by. The liquor store and 24 hour grocery were 2 minutes away. There was also a dollar store right there, so if you forgot your toothbrush or any little item it's no hassle to get them. 

If you want to be close to the night life and attractions, it is a little far removed.

All in all, very happy with the apartment and would love to stay there again on the summer to take advantage of the rooftop terrace.","10"
"This apartment is a lovely base to explore Montreal! Spacious, nicely decorated (I loved the romantic touch!), and very well located, in the middle of the vibrant Plateau. Highly recommended!","10"
"Melanie's place was BEAUTIFUL! I cannot describe to you the type of vintage vibe i got from her condo. It was really cozy and made you feel right at home. There were shops just down the street that was convenient to go to. She would get back to me about any questions I had right away. She was overall one of the best hosts I've had. I highly recommend her place for anyone that wants that Paris cozy home feeling.","10"
"My sister and I had a wonderful time in Melanies lovely clean  walk up apartment in Montreal. The neighbourhood was perfect. I was also able to bring my dog! The two bedrooms were very comfortable as was the living space.","10"
"Close to buses, or can walk to Metro.  Close to Mont Royal, 24 hour grocery store, banks, cafes, restaurants etc. 
Well maintained place; lots of nice touches, coffee, sugar, spices of all sorts, sauces, etc.  Bedrooms were best part of this apartment; 2 private bedrooms. Would be great in summer to go out onto roof top although stair way is pretty steep to roof.  Hostess responds to inquiries, questions etc.","10"
"The appartment was clean and bright (and warm) when we arrived, with two comfy beds. The metro station in about 15-20 minute walk away which takes you right into the city, but the buses were great as well as the appartment is right on an interchange. 
I would recommend the appartment as a good base.","10"
"Perfect place for a couple.  Great neighborhood with restaurants, exercise places, a park...and very close the downtown activities.","10"
"Melanie’s place was amazing. It was cozy and clean. Great location. Close to downtown. There are a lot of great restaurants nearby.","10"
"Spent two days there and had a great time. We didn’t spend much time in the apartment, but it’s cozy and the rooftop terrace offers great views. There’s a park, as well as plenty of places to eat nearby as well. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.","10"
"We enjoyed our stay here.  The space was very clean and had a feel like home.","10"
"Melanie’s place is a hidden gem! It has an amazing location close to everything, and the place itself is absolutely gorgeous. Melanie was extremely accommodating for us since we were driving in from the US and she provided all the needed amenities. Don’t hesitate, stay here!","10"
"Melanie's place was great.  Check in was easy.  It was in a great location and parking was super easy.  Melanie gave us great recommendations for places to eat and it was easy to fill out weekend with activities around Montreal.  I would highly recommend this place is your are looking for a GREAT value for a GREAT price!   This place was great for two friends but I would also recommend it for two couples.  Highly recommend!","10"

Thanks Melanie!","10"

"Great location with easy access to downtown Montreal via the metro. Good views from the rooftop patio!","10"
"Melanie's place was great. The roof deck was amazing and I wish we could have stayed longer! Street parking was annoying, but I suppose that's par for the course. Would definitely stay at Melanie's place again--it was clean with comfortable beds, close to everything and did I mention the roof deck!??","10"
"My friend drove up from Ontario and I flew in from BC for an epic best friends reunion. Melanie’s place was great for our needs. Had everything we needed and great location. Would definitely stay there again and recommend!!","10"
"An easy check-in and check-out, cute and clean, no frills spot in Montreal. Thanks for a nice stay!","10"
"Appartement sympa,  un peu de marche jusqu'au centre Montréal mais c'était prévu ! Bon séjour","10"
"Melanie’s place is in a good location and is a good value. We were a bit worried about parking, but it was easy. Dog friendly is a big plus. Not a luxury apartment—the bathroom is quite small, some windows don’t have screens, no lock box—but you aren’t paying for luxury, either.","10"
"Nice and convenient place to stay in a perfect neighbourhood!","10"
"A terrific space with plenty of amenities in walking distance, and close to so much of the best the city has to offer, including Mile End, the mountain, and Old Montreal. Would gladly stay here again.","10"
"The place was clean and stylish (I love loft style places) and and all amenities mentioned were available. Location is great with lots of places to eat, 10mins drive to Mount Royal. Melanie accommodated for a bit of late check out and was available for any questions. ","10"
"Was great!!","10"
"Great space in a great location. Would recommend to anyone staying and looking for a hip spot close to bars and a good selection of restaurants!","10"

Seconde fois que nous logeons dans cet appartement que nous apprécions

 Mélanie a été disponible par téléphone et messages quand nous avions besoin.","10"
"Excellent location, comfy beds and the on street parking was never a problem.","10"
"Melanie's place was very homey and comfortable. We loved the big TV, board games, and lots of tea and coffee. It's a little hard to find the first time, but once you know where it is it's very accessible. We loved our stay!","10"
"Annie's communication prior to our stay was thorough and thoughtful.  We had cell phone numbers and names of two contacts that could welcome us on our day of arrival.  This was very helpful since the time needed to pass through the border of the USA and Canada can be unpredictable.  Our welcome contact showed us around the apartment, introduced us to Momo and was very friendly.  She even walked us to the nearby street where we would find restaurant choices because eating was our priority in that moment!

Fresh ground coffee, a French Press and many bright and beautiful colors both inside and out from painted walls, kitchenware and blooming flowers welcomed us in the morning.  The deck felt soft underfoot and the privacy of the backyard extended the kitchen in an organic way. The pool was refreshing and soothing to view.  The entire space was aesthetically pleasing.

At night we slept well.  All was quiet.  The shower worked well.  The coming and going was easy and gentle.","9"
"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Annie. Le logement est très bien agencé et très proche du métro ce qui est vraiment appréciable, surtout que nous voyagions avec 3 enfants. La cour est agréable nous avons pu en profiter ainsi que du barbecue !! Nous n'avons manqué de rien ! ","9"
"We enjoyed our stay at Annie's condo very much. It is centrally located, has a lovely garden and pool, and all the amenities we needed from towels to pots and pans. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, close to the Jean Talon Market and a little park for our son to play in. 
Annie was helpful in answering any questions we had, we are sorry we never got to meet her. 
Momo is a friendly cat who always let us know if he needed to get in or out.  ","9"
"Nous avons apprécié notre séjour avec la petite. Le prêt du parc a été super ce qui a permis de diminuer le nombre d'objet à apporter. L'emplacement, la terrasse, le logement en général étaient selon nos attentes. Merci pour votre hospitalité ! Guillaume, Annie et Maëly.","9"
"Four of us stayed at Annie's place over a long weekend and it was the perfect spot to start and end our days in Montreal. The pool and backyard were charming, and the neighbourhood itself had everything we needed. I've stayed in downtown Montreal in the past, but prefer this nieghbourhood. The flat was spacious - the four of us never felt like we were on top of each other. Annie was helpful and responsive even though she was on vacation herself. Great stay!","9"
"Lovely apartment located in a very hip neighborhood. Great restaurants and shops.","9"
"We have stayed at a few places on AirBnB and Annie's was great. Eclectic with a touch of old world feel, you will love the flow into the back yard, the proximity to the Metro and Little Italy. 

Everything you need is so close. The neighborhood is very interesting and represents a part of Montreal that should be embraced.

Annie was a great host - she took the time to make sure we felt at home!","9"
"We enjoy the place, it was cosy and comfortable.. We appreciated the closeness of shops, restaurants and metro. 

My sisters loved the pool :) 

I enjoyed the company of Momo the cat :)","9"
"Séjour parfait, au paradis pour reprendre les précédents commentaires ! Nous avions tout ce qu il faut, maison très bien placée dans un quartier très sympa, ultra propre avec tout ce qu il faut et même plus ! Merci encore Annie ! ","9"
"La maison est vraiment très charmante avec un petit jardin et une belle terrasse dont nous avons bien profité. La chambre et le bureau/chambre sont spacieux mais en demi sous sol, ce qui est très fréquent à Montréal mais qui peut surprendre les français que nous sommes.
Il s'agit d'une colocation, avec plusieurs colocataires locaux,  sympa pour les échanges mais cela demande une certaine discrétion.
Le quartier est très chouette près du grand parc Jarry... idéal pour apprécier la vie montréalaise.

"Dominic was friendly and helpful! We were not in the unit much as we were out for the whole day.","10"
"Thank you so much Geneva for letting us stay in your lovely home. The location is very close to all of the fun activities Montreal has to offer. The detail, and care you put in to your home was outstanding. Our group would like to thank you for your hospitality! Definitely would come back. ","9"
"Don't be discouraged by the outside of the building. Geneva has a charming apartment with nice pieces of furniture.  She was out of town when we arrived but answered questions quickly. In fact, when we were there she had been away for a while and had had some AirBnB guests staying, so the apartment wasn't as clean as you might want. We liked the neighbourhood and the great cafes nearby. The Korean restaurant was nice.","9"
"Geneva was a great host.  She was very flexible with our check-in time.  The apartment was as pictured and very clean.  The location was wonderful and had a great neighborhood feel.","9"
"Great comfortable apartment. Very close to stores, bars and transportation.","9"
"We were very happy with our stay at Geneva's apartment! It was in the perfect location (close to Drawn & Quarterly and many other wonderful spots) and it was very comfortable.","9"
"Geneva was very welcoming. The apartment is surrounded with lots of tasty cafes and restaurants around the area. Will definitely go back to this place again if i ever visit montreal again. =)","9"
"Geneva was nice. The apartment was as presented. The neighbourhood is great. No complaints!","9"
"The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"We loved Geneva's place, it was perfect for our small family. She was helpful via text for finding parking and quick to respond to questions. Great neighborhood too!
Thank-you Geneva!","9"
"We had a nice time in Geneva's apartment. The apartment was basically as described, and we enjoyed time in the apartment's two outdoor spaces. All in all it was a great base to use to explore Montreal.","9"
"Had a really great time staying at Geneva's in the mile end. Apt was very cute and cozy and Geneva was very communicative during the whole process. For my first time using airbnb it was overall a great experience!","9"
"Geneva's apt was great to stay in for our Osheaga adventure!  We thoroughly enjoyed the two porches and the neighborhood was very fun to explore.","9"
"Geneva's apartment is super well located, huge and generally overflowing with good vibes - from the aesthetically great kitchen with creeper vines around the walls, to the living room-dining room with a huge table to spread out on and soft couch, the whole place was generally excellent. 

It's also in a great, convenient spot in the Mile End, well served by public transport.","9"
"Geneva n'a pas pu nous accueillir mais nous avons trouvé un appartement agréable bien situé pour toutes nos sorties.","9"
"Geneva’s place was definitely our favorite AirBnB in Montreal.  It’s in an older building and has a nice quaint, classic feel to it: natural light, wood floors, some neat plants in the kitchen, and a perfect layout.  Their’s a small back porch with a fantastic view of the alley behind the house, which was covered in plants, vines, and people enjoying the air on their decks.  The mile end area was such a lively, picturesque place.

Geneva was friendly, helpful, and spoke fluent english (and Spanish!).  We enjoyed our stay!","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 126 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Très bonne expérience au centre de Montréal! Colocs sympa et appartement très chouette!","10"
"The perfect place in the perfect location of downtown Montreal.  The online pictures match the spacious loft apartment, and my room was ready with fresh sheets and bath towels.  The host left post-it notes with tips throughout the apartment - include an empty shelf in the refrigerator and kitchen cabinet for me to leave things.  There is no better location for jazz fest, and we walked everywhere from this very central location.","10"
"A great place to stay, great location with very welcoming and friendly hosts. Thoroughly recommended. ","10"
"Great place full of unique furniture and art. I found it to be a productive writing space and ended up getting a lot of work done in the communal areas while I was there. Everyone living there was respectful of my space and delightful to talk to on occasion. My room was super quiet, practically sound proof, which is nice. The neighborhood is close to several train and bus lines that connect to other parts of the city, right in the heart of downtown, which was very convenient for me.","10"
"My stay at Pauline's and Thomas's place was very pleasant. Their spacious and sun-filled loft is full of character and charme. I was allowed to fully use their kitchen, washer & dryer and got a fan in my room which was pleasant after a warm day. Pauline & Thomas are nice people that are very easy to get along with and are very warm.
Conveniently located close to old town and the Palais de Congres one can also easily go grocery shopping and quickly reach Ste-Catherine and the Arts district around UQAM.
I'll be happy to stay at their palce again.","10"
"I stayed about two weeks in this awesome loft and I can totally recommend it! Thomas, Pauline & Ben were very nice and helpfull and the loft looks even better than on the fotos! Not to forget Cousecous, propably the cuttest cat I ever met. Merci!","10"
"Pauline and Thomas were very friendly, gracious and hospitable hosts during my stay, and it was a pleasure getting to know them and their fellow roommate Benoit. It's important to note that Pauline was very accommodating to my arrival schedule and had a high degree of organization, which I appreciated greatly, given the much different experience I had earlier with a neighboring hotel. The loft was much larger than I expected and situated perfectly within reach of Montreal's major points of interest. Cous Cous was probably the most chill and relaxed cat I've ever seen. I'd most certainly recommend the experience to anyone, including my own return visit to Montreal.","10"
"I stayed at this place for 3 weeks. Pauline and Thomas (and also roommate Ben) were very friendly and hospitable. They have an unique and gorgeous loft, which they have furnished and decorated in their own artistic styles. The place has huge living area and a kitchen - and bedroom was quite cozy as well. The location of the place is very convenient with metro and grocery shops close by. Cous Cous and Sid are probably the most relaxed and friendly cats I have ever seen, who I guess have learned a thing or two about hospitality from their owners :-) Overall I had a wonderful time in this charming loft and I would definitely stay here again.  ","10"
"J'ai passé une semaine super. Pas vu le temps passé. Colocataires ultra-sympas. Mention spéciale pour les parties de PS4 sur rétroprojecteur et pour les deux chats : monsieur Paul et couscous (alias maître du cosmos).","10"
"I spent a weekend here. The loft is great. It got so much space in the living room. And the private room is nice and tidy. Roommates were friendly. They are bilingual which is sweet for a English speaker in Montreal. Great weekend for me.","10"
"Très grande chambre dans un loft immense. A deux pas du Palais des congrès et du complexe Desjardins!","10"
"It is a really good place, very creative furniture set up and unique. Pauline responses really fast once I had questions, and her roommates were really friendly and helpful. This place located down town, close to everywhere. I like everything there.","10"
"Very good","10"
"Pauline's place is one of the most special Airbnb I've ever stayed on. The flat is mega cool and has all amenities you need and it's very central and convenient if you are arriving by bus from the airport. Check-in couldn't be easier. I would definitely stay there again.","10"
"Super loft à la déco vintage !!! :)","10"
"Couldn't have chosen a better place to stay in Montréal. Pauline was so kind and considerate. The space so clean, homey and cozy. The suite had tons of natural light. Couscous was the sweetest cat we've ever met. Pauline has a very impressive plant collection. The location was perfect for all the sights we wanted to see. There were restaurants, galleries, bixi stations and the metro nearby. We would definitely recommend staying here on your trip to Montréal.   Thanks Pauline!","10"
"Pauline’s place is perfect for stay one or two persons, the bed and the room are cosy and comfortable. The rest of the apartment, which is shared, is beautiful and clean. The location can not be better. Everything was as expected and Pauline is such a great host, I have to do a last minute change and we agreed immediately, she was comprehensive and nice. So I recommend this place.","10"
"My stay at Pauline’s was fantastic. From the incredibly clean environment, the wonderful location, the great people, to Couscous, the friendly and cuddly cat :)
If I need a place to stay in Montreal again, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay at Pauline’s again. I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a room in Montreal.","10"
"Pauline's place was spacious and artistic, Couscous was the most loving cat, had a fun stay over in Montreal!","10"

"Marie's 2-bedroom apt in the Plateau was perfect for our stay. Great location, both to the Metro and to the Mont-Royal, with everything you needed a short walk away. Although Marie and I missed the chance to actually meet face-to-face due to our schedules, we worked around it and made arrangements for keys, etc.  She left us a great 'cheat sheet' for the apt and what to do in the neighbourhood that was very helpful, as well as an amazing spread of continental goodies (croissants, fruit, coffee and the like). It was very much a hotel-like stay with all the comforts of home. Marie stayed in touch via text/email throughout our visit to ensure everything was in order. Overall a very pleasant experience! Merci Marie!","9"
"Marie was very friendly, informative and thoughtful ( she even kindly left us croissants, juice and coffee for our first breakfast). The apartment was very clean and comfortable, with everything that we needed, and it's situated in a really interesting area of Montreal. The whole stay was first rate and we recommend Marie and her apartment as an excellent airbnb option in Montreal. Thank you Marie.","9"
"L'appartement est immense et très propre.

L'hôte nous a fourni tous les détails nécessaires à ce qu'on passe un voyage fabuleux.

La communication avec elle a été très efficace et complète.

La situation de l'appartement est extraordinaire.","9"
"A great spot to stay in a fun and vibrant neighbourhood! It was really snowy when we were there so we parked our car (found street parking easily) and did all of our exploring on foot. 

The apartment is very cozy and comfortable. Marie was a gracious host. She responded quickly to inquiries and made sure that we had everything we needed.

The best thing about this apartment? The espresso machine. We're going to have to buy one of our own now.","9"
"Great appartment with excellente loacation in the Plateau of Montreal. Marie was very kind to leave us many indications to have a very pleasent stay!","9"
"Wonderfull host, allways helpfull and easy to reach. The location is perfect and the place was exactly as the pictures are roomy and very clean. Just perfect for our family of four.","9"
"Great apartment near it all! Marie was very communicative and left the apartment spotless for our arrival. Two closed bedrooms make it an ideal place to stay for coworkers or friends. It's near a ton of shops, restaurants and bars on Mt Royal and St Laurent. Really enjoyed the stay and hope it's available for rent the next time I'm in MTL. Thanks Marie!","9"
"Our family of four stayed with Marie for the second time and it was once again a wonderful time. The apartment and the location are great. Marie is a very caring host. We can truly recommend it.","9"
"L'appartement de Marie est très sympa et confortable. On s'y sent vite comme chez soi.
Il est idéalement situé sur le plateau.
Je regrette de ne pas avoir rencontré Marie qui a été adorable dans nos échanges par mail.","9"
"Wonderful 6-night stay in Marie's cozy Mont Royal neighborhood apartment during our epic Women's World Cup trip to Canada.  Marie is very responsive and helpful; although we did not meet her, she was very personable by email and text.  The apartment is IDEAL for an active couple or family.  The walkup apartment is close to Parc Mont Royal for a hike or challenging run, and within a short walk of 3 Bixi bike stations (the best way to see Montreal is by bike; we took the Bixi everywhere, day and night0- to Biosphere, Jazz Festival, Stadium de Montreal for World Cup).  Also close to the metro and bus to Airport.  Marie was very attentive in leaving information on the Montreal Jazz Festival.  We enjoyed the festival thoroughly, and were able to get tickets to see John Mayall, a lifelong dream for myself and my spouse.  The apartment was exactly as pictured, kitchen well-equipped (I cooked for us one night) and walkable to very hip area of bars, cafes, and restaurants.  The NetFlix worked great to stream (Canada has a lot more content available than the USA), and Marie's internet was fast.  Our second trip to Montreal, and quite enjoyed staying there. It was a very good value as well. Thanks Marie, you are a wonderful hostess!

"Marie was a very welcoming host.  She kept in touch to see that all was ok, and did her best to make our 2 week stay enjoyable.   Her apartment is ideally located, close to supermarkets, pharmacies, cafes, bars, restaurants and yet, it is very quiet.  The living areas are spacious and comfortable.  It is a 10 minute walk to Mont Royal metro station.  ","9"
"Marie was very quick to respond to any questions, and went above and beyond in making our stay comfortable. My wife and I visited Montreal with our 18 month old daughter and the apartment was clean, comfortable and quiet. The location was very convenient with easy walking to several parks, grocery stores and to the Metro. Marie provided us with a map of nearby parks and plug covers for all the outlets. The a/c was necessary during a heat wave, but was able to keep the whole place comfortable. I would highly recommend this apartment and would look to book again for a return trip.","9"
"Staying at Simon and Erika's apartment for a week was our best Air BnB experience yet! Their home is a beautiful gem. Gorgeous, clean, comfortable, inviting, interesting, accommodating—staying here was everything one could ask for in a vacation space. They left us informative instructions, great recommendations to the neighbourhood, and were easy to contact during our stay. Rosemont is a great little neighbourhood; it had an excellent bakery and every basic amenity nearby. Despite being further East, it's only a quick bus away from two different metro lines. Would love to stay here again! ","10"
"Very nice, big, comfortable and stylish flat. Simon is very nice and gave us plenty information. We highly recommend it.","10"
"Un grand merci à Anouchka !
Très gentille et très prévenante, Anouchka nous a envoyé un mail avant de partir pour s'assurer que nous sachions comment rejoindre son appartement. Elle nous a même proposé de nous attendre à la station de métro pour nous y conduire. Elle nous a remis les clés en personne et fait visiter son appartement. Elle a même prévu de nous laisser tout ce qu'il fallait pour prendre le petit déjeuner le lendemain matin, ce qui est appréciable quand on arrive dans la soirée. Le lendemain, elle nous a envoyé un SMS pour savoir comment c'était passé notre première nuit et nous demander si on avait besoin de quelque chose pour parfaire notre séjour. Le logement est très chaleureux, conforme en tout point aux photos, propre et très acceuillant. On s' y sent très bien !! Nous n'hésiterons pas à demander à Anouchka de nous le relouer lors de notre prochaine visite à Montréal ! Le quartier est très agréable et la proximité du métro très appréciable. Merci encore Anouchka et à bientôt !","10"
"Anouchka's wonderful apartment is really a home away from home. Bright, colorful, full of natural sunlight and fully equipped with everything you need to make your stay in Montreal incredibly enjoyable. Her place is located within walking distance of great places to eat and visit, including the Jean-Talon Market (a must see for anyone visiting the city). Anouchka was very responsive and accommodated my late arrival without any issues - I'd highly recommend her place for anyone visiting Montreal!

L'appartement de Anouchka est vraiment un 'home away from home'. Lumineux, coloré, plein de lumière naturelle et entièrement équipée avec tout ce que vous aurez besoin pour rendre votre séjour à Montréal très agréable. Son apart est situé à super proche de bons endroits pour manger et visiter, y compris le marché Jean-Talon (un must-see pour tous ceux qui visitent la ville). Anouchka été très réactif par SMS - je vous conseille de rester a sa maison pour tous ceux qui visitent Montréal!

Nous avons loué l'appartement pendant 1 semaine, je le recommande vivement à tout ceux qui cherchent un toit chaleureux, accueillant et surtout plein d'énergie. 
L'appartement est à proximité de lieux intéressants et on s'y sent comme chez soi. J'y retournerai avec grand plaisir !!!!!!","10"
"I always feel cozy and comfortable at the airbnb's I stay in, but there was something about Anouchka's that really made me feel like I was at home, like no other time has. My boyfriend and I took the train up from NYC, and I was planning on updating Anouchka on our arrival time using the wifi on the train-- since we got transferred to a bus in Albany, I had no way of contacting her once we crossed the Canadian border. I was so worried, since the unexpected change caused us to arrive later than expected-- but Anouchka was completely prepared to handle every situation and left the keys for us in a convenient place even though we weren't able to meet her as planned. Nothing beat waking up in that beautiful, warm, comfortable haven each morning and seeing the snowfall outside. Thank you, Anouchka, for giving us the perfect home during our short but memorable stay in Montreal! ","10"
"Anouchka met us at the apartment as planned.  She is a very gracious host and made us feel welcome.  All of our questions about the neighbourhood were answered in a notebook complete with maps.  The apartment was clean and was well equipped .

We would certainly stay here again.  Thank you Anouchka.","10"

"Nous avons passé un excellent moment à Montréal ! La maison de Anouchka est très jolie, calme et reposant dans un quartier à la fois central mais pas trop. Anouchka est très réactive et disponible. Merci à elle.","10"
"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. Good bed with nice linens. Apartment decorated in nice colors - nice and bright! The kitchen was equipped and the bathroom had good water pressure. The book left in the apartment described a bunch of places to check out - came in handy as we visited a local bakery and coffee shop (really nice). The neighborhood is classic Montreal. Tree lined streets with three story walk-ups. Very close to Jarry metro and Jarry Park. Lots of local shops  close by including grocery and pharmacy. We had no trouble finding street parking. I always travel with a sleep mask and it did come in handy as the apartment is nice and bright and the curtains in the bedroom lets light come in. If you are there in the summer months and have the windows open there is a bit of street noise, not a whole lot but a bit. This wouldn't apply in the cooler months when the windows are closed. Overall I recommend this apartment - it's very clean and quaint and the neighborhood is classic Montreal and close to metro, with easy street parking and lots around!","10"
"Notre arrivée a été bien préparée par Anouchka, merci à elle ! elle a été très disponible, réactive, sympathique. elle avait aussi préparé une farde avec des informations pratiques pour notre séjour. 
L'appartement est bien situé, une station de métro à quelques minutes à pieds, puis de là, accès facile au centre. 
au final, bon rapport qualité/prix !","10"
"Anouchka's apartment is an oasis! It is absolutely warm and cozy and also very peaceful and relaxing. We weren't sure where to look for places to stay in Montreal. In fact, we only picked Anouchka's apartment because of the great pictures and glowing reviews -- we had no idea where it was in Montreal in relation to attractions/restaurants/etc. I'm glad we chose this place to stay!

Anouchka left a great traveler's guide complete with suggestions of where to go in her neighborhood. The neighborhood is not in Old Montreal -- you need to take the metro which is located right down the street. I found the location to be perfect. Good restaurants and cafes; tree-lined streets and cool looking apartments; a great bar with local craft beer; etc. There is also a great balcony off the kitchen where you can enjoy breakfast or a book or a drink. The neighborhood was quiet when we were there and even with a party going on downstairs, I couldn't hear them at all when I went to bed. 

Anouchka's apartment is incredibly clean. The decor is bright and cheery (I loved all the plants!). The bedroom is huge. The bathroom is huge. The sitting room is cozy with a nice, big couch. The kitchen is full sized. It felt like home!  The pictures here on AirBnB are a great representation of this apartment.

Thank you for opening up your home to us! We truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this flat to anyone!

"Anouchka's apartment was just great, exactly what we wanted in Montreal. Cozy, funky, and with everything we needed. The neighborhood is good, residential with enough bars and restaurants around to make it worth exploring, and with easy access to the metro to get to the center.","10"
"The listing was described exactly how it looks-- very colorful and welcoming. The location was a 5 minute walk from The Metro, which was very convenient. A great coffee shop was a 5 minute walk away as well, it is called Cafe Larue & Fil. Anouchka was super flexible, friendly, and easy to get a hold of. We enjoyed our stay very much!","10"
"Le guide du voyageur réalisé par Anouchka était juste parfait et ça m'a permis de découvrir les bonnes adresses de Montréal :) le quartier est juste sublime et l'appartement correspond en tout point aux photos et à l'annonce.","10"
"The apartment was as depicted in the ad. It was clean, comfortable, bright, colorful, and really seemed to impart a sense of the host (whom we did not meet this trip, but I spoke with on the telephone). The arrival arrangements were as promised, even though we were later than anticipated. Having a washer and dryer in the apartment was great. The weather was hot and humid but there was a rotating fan in the apartment that helped a great deal in that regard. We felt comfortable while there and were able to enjoy coffee on the terrace in the mornings (at least when it wasn't raining =)

The neighborhood was as described by other reviewers -- quiet, residential, diverse. A short walk to Jarry street presented a side array of options for dining, coffee, and drinks. There were several Vietnamese restaurants, Greek, Italian, and a couple of bars. We returned again and again to EtOH, which was on Jarry and St-Denis, as they had twenty craft beers on tap and good pub food. Java Mythe, which was marked in a Traveller's Guide Anouchka has put together and placed in the apartment, had excellent coffee. A bit of a walk first thing in the morning, but worth it. A walk to Parc Jarry turned up a free concert Friday evening; and over on Villeray we were able to get our poutine fix at Frites Alors. The subway, also on Jarry, was a short walk, and between that, our feet, and the 193 and 30 buses, we were able to go anywhere we wanted without having to touch the car for five days. Downtown, the Old City, the Plateau and Parc Mont-Royal, the waterfront and Atwater Market -- for the most part, were within half an hour without needed the car. We would not hesitate to return to Anouchka's apartment.","10"
"Anouchka was very helpful. The apartment was small but cozy. It is well-situated, close to the Metro.","10"
"Appartement chaleureux et relaxant et très bien situé . Anouchka est toujours disponible pour nous lors de notre séjour. Je conseille cet endroit fortement.","10"
"Anouchkas apartment was wonderful. Bright, exceptionally clean, and everything the pictures portrayed it to be. We were able to relax, and she was always prompt with responding anytime we needed something. We would  recomend this place to anyone.","10"
"Anouchka offers a very friendly and thoughtful experience to travelers. She maintained contact with us before we arrived, made sure we were clear about how to enter the apartment, and left many interesting maps and brochures about the area. She also created a neighborhood map that pointed out various locations for meals and shopping. The apartment is very clean, and super energetic and colorful. The kitchen is well stocked with necessary items and allows for comfortable meals and socializing. The rest of the apartment offers comfort amidst a creative décor. There are many lighting options, which is nice when you just want to hang out or relax. The little porch provided a great place to find fresh air while sipping on drinks or reading a book. The surrounding area, while further away from the hub of Le Plateau or Downtown Montreal, provides quick access to the Jean Talon market --- an amazing must see place --- and the #30 bus which can transport one to more bustling areas rather quickly. For the past decade or so, we have tended to stay in Le Plateau region, and were a little worried about being so far out. But in the end, this was an amazing choice because we explored the Villeray/St Michel area, as well as Mile End, places we had ignored in previous visits to Montreal. As a result of the switch, we found great bagel and gift shops in Mile End, and appreciated a week long supply of fresh berries and veggies from the Jean Talon market.  When we wanted to go out for dinner or to a museum, we found the bus (with a stop just on the corner) to be incredibly convenient, and the metro a short and interesting walk away. We did not get a chance to explore the restaurants in the immediate area, although there are many. For us, being able to spread out, to relax, and to savor foods prepared at home was a real treat, which was made even more incredible by Anouchka’s decorating talent. We hope to return next year for a longer stay, and will definitely first look to see if this apartment is available. I am now a huge fan of Airbnb and Anouchka’s hospitality!","10"
"Great stay! Comfortable apartment full of character and not too far from the sights. Anouchka left a book full of neighborhood tips and useful information. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting her, but she made it easy to get the keys and was very flexible on the departure time. We felt really at home during our stay!","10"
"We really liked how bright and colorful the apartment was!  The welcome info and maps really helped us take advantage of the neighborhood. The free street parking was also a perk! Overall it was a great first Airbnb experience! We would definitely recommend this apartment.","10"
"I had an amazing time in Montreal anchored by Anouchka's beautiful apartment. I found her apartment  spacious, colorful and inspiring  with two balconies and it was situated close to station Jarry, which was one stop away from beautiful Jean Talon & little Italy. Getting downtown and to old Montreal was also a short ride away. Anouchka was a wonderful host, when I arrived she had a booklet with suggestions about the neighborhood, and apartment rules and even maps and tour guide pamphlets about the city. I could've asked for a better experience.","10"
"Anouchka's apartment was exactly what we were looking for on our first trip to Montreal. It was a nice size in a quiet neighbourhood away from all the tourists. I recommend it highly.","10"
"Anouchka's apartment was absolutely fantastic. The neighborhood is beautiful and welcoming, and Anouchka's ""travellers guide"" is incredibly helpful; it has complete instructions on everything in the apartment (including how to fix the Wifi if it broke!), and the local recommendations are useful and fantastic (especially Java Mythe and El Rey Del Taco).

Overall, I could not imagine a better place to stay in Montreal.","10"

"My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful apartment in Montreal. It was near transportation, clean, and comfortable. Our host's information binder of maps and suggestions was perfect! We followed many ideas from the binder and were pleasantly surprised by the Java Myth Cafe, Tapeo, and Le Coin G. Thanks to Anoushka's reccommendations, our experience in Montreal was exactly what we wanted: a short visit to a wonderful city without being in the touristy area. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you for opening your home to us!","10"

Definitely recommend!","10"
"Colorful room and the host is well communicated.","10"
"This was as described and was an great experience. We are frequent visitors to Montreal and were there for a wedding in Laval so needed something on the north side of the island.

Highly recommend this great apartment, you would be a fool to stay in a hotel!","10"

"Very nice host, excellent place! I regard it as a home-like experience. Perfect position in downtown with metro station nearby. I will definitely come back next time i go Montreal.","9"
"The apartment is just as it appears in the photos. My room was the smaller one, and had a twin bed. The mattress was hard, but quite comfortable, i slept very well. The rooms works for a small person, but could not accommodate two people. Everything was clean and in good shape, almost like a hotel room. The kitchen has a fridge, so you can leave your food there. It is not a room in someone's apartment, it is a room in a rental flat - something to consider. You have a lot of privacy, but don't get to interact with the hosts much. Grace and Irwin are kind and helpful, provided with everything I needed, and waited for me to arrive although it was quite late. They were quick to respond when I was there and whenever I needed anything. I used the washer and dryer - all worked perfectly.

The neighborhood is great! The metro is across the street, there is a convenience store in front of the apartment, a supermarket 5 minutes away, plenty of restaurants less than 5 minutes away. Very safe. The arts museum is less than 10 minute walk away. You can walk to a lot of places or take the metro when you are tired. Great location, very convenient.","9"
"I rented this apartment for one of my IT consultant for about 3 weeks with the intention of him returning a month later for another 2-3 months stay and he loved the place so very much that I had to rebook the same place before he even checked out to make sure that he would get back the same place. He absolutely refused to stay anywhere else. Not only were the accommodations pass satisfactory but Grace, the host, is a doll! She makes sure you're comfortable, warm and the apartment is always clean! Honestly, I can not think of one thing that my consultant complained about, he loved everything, he gave his stay a 10/10.


Thank you   ","9"
"Grace and Irwin were terrific hosts.  I shared a room in an apartment, but the other tenant was quiet and worked long hours, so it worked out.

All in all, a good downtown condo close to everything you need.","9"

"I met Grace and Irwin briefly.  Clifton their son was kind enough to take my luggage to the 3rd floor where my room was.  The kitchen area was nice and clean.  My room was small and neat and clean.  It was big enough for my short two day stay.  The 3rd floor had two separate bedrooms that allowed to share the kitchen area.  The neighbor hood was a great location to restaurants, coffee shops, the arts and Jazz Festival.  It was a great and safe location.  I booked on short notice so it worked out great.  Thanks Grace & Irwin!

I had the opportunity to stay at Grace and Irwin's condo; this was the first time I use Airb&b services and I was very pleased.  Grace is a wonderful lady, I spend a few minutes with her drinking tea.  I did not feel too well with a bad cold and she made sure I had some of her special delicious jasmine tea.  Their son is a wonderful young man who also invited me for a cup of tea while Grace and Irwin were out.  The place is impeccably clean and comfortable close to the nicest areas of Montreal, on Maisonneuve Rue and St. Catherine Rue just behind the condominium, many many restaurants.  Easy access to the metro and walking distance to downtown Montreal. The place is full of life surrounded by young kids from Concordia University, McGill University and Montreal. Overall a wonderful experience.  ","9"
"I had arrived a little later than I thought which was a good thing, as the room was not quite ready. However, the room was just as described. It was nice, small and the en-suite bathroom was good enough for 1 person stay. Comfortable! And cool after a day's excursion. Grace was very kind and her son was super helpful - taking all my questions with patience! The area was great within public transport and restaurants. Very nice place and very nice people!","9"

"Grace and Irwin's condo unit was exactly as described. The pictures shown were accurate and like what the other guests had pointed out the unit was conveniently located. Shopping, sightseeing, eating, and drinking were all within walking distance. If you want to venture out further, have no fear access to public transit is literally diagonally across the street. 

Do note though, there are 3 flights of stairs and no elevator. Luckily, their son and an older gentleman gladly helped me with my suitcase. ","9"

"Pleasent experience. The apartment was clean as promised. Excellent location. I recommend it!","9"
"Grace was so welcoming, as was her son who did a great job of helping me to get oriented. The apartment is located half a block from Concordia Univ and the Guy-Concordia metro station. The neighborhood is lively and felt quite safe, with many restaurants, cafes, and a market nearby. The apartment is well-maintained and very clean, and I slept well in the comfy bed. I was really glad that my room had a desk and privacy shades that also let in natural light. There's a nicely updated kitchen & dining table in the common area, which was great for saving money on breakfast. I really felt at home for my week-long visit, and having a convenient place to stay made this a more productive trip for me. Thank you so much!","9"
"Grace and her family do a nice job.   The rooms are newly renovated and everything is very clean.   we plan to stay with them again.","9"

"Perfect place to enjoy montreal! Very convenient to access public transportation and a lots of stores and restaurants. On top of this very clean and comfortable place.
Grace & Irwin are so nice.","9"
"Grace & Irwin were the most hospitable hosts I've had in all my Airbnb travels (and I've had quite a few of hospitable hosts already!!). The Airbnb unit itself is meticulously cleaned and the location cannot be beat. I would recommend this place to anyone!!! As a bonus, they own the tea shop below the Airbnb, and it's a great place to get a refreshing drink or a delectable meal. (I recommend the General Tao's poutine!!!)","9"
"Great location within walking distance of central sites and very close to metro station. Good sized room and access to kitchen facilities if required. Air conditioning a major plus for summer time visits. Hosts were very helpful with recommendations for my stay.","9"
"Grace & Irwin were amazing hosts! I had to change my check-in time quite a bit on short notice, but they were very easy to communicate with and arranged a new check-in time without any problems =) 
The room is super clean, quiet, the airconditioning is very convenient and the bathroom has everything that is needed (water pressure really is quite low, as mentioned by the hosts). 
The location was excellent, I was actually able to walk everywhere, including nice restaurants, old town, Mount Royal, bus terminal etc.. I was really surprised that such a quiet room in such a nice house could be so close to all major attractions! Would definetly stay here again and can recommend it to anyone who is travelling alone and needs a safe, nice and accomodating place to stay! ","9"
"O Irwin e a Grace foram anfitriões bastante amigáveis e prestativos. O quarto é confortável e o local é perto de vários restaurantes e a menos de um quilômetro de um grande shopping. Fiquei muito satisfeito e fica minha recomendação.","9"
"Grace and her family are great hosts. Although I arrived quite lately, Grace was waiting for me. The condo is very comfortable and clean with easy access to the subway. I enjoyed my stay here and I highly recommend to choose Grace & Irwin!","9"
"This room is exactly as described: super clean, very new and at an affordable price. Location was great as well. If I'm back in Montreal, I know where to stay!","9"
"This is a very good place to stay.  The location is terrific--the neighborhood is interesting and the apartment is just a block from the metro.  The apartment is very clean and quiet, and Grace and Irwin were friendly and helpful.  The bedroom is small, but it has a nice closet and a desk and chair--  it was everything I needed for my stay.  The kitchen was great for doing some simple cooking.  I would want to stay there again, if I had the opportunity to come to Montreal.","9"
"Great room in a great location. Close to everything that is downtown. Perfect for tourists.

Room is convenient and clean.

Definitely recommend Grace and Irwin's place!","9"
"Grace&Irwin and their son are very friendly and welcoming, I really enjoyed living in their place!","9"
"Grace and Irwin's flat was a really good choice. Place looks decent enough from the outside, even better inside. They did mention that the water pressure isn't the best, but it still worked fine - not really a big issue for me. It's really good value for money given its location. Walking distance to lots of shops, restaurants, pubs, etc... Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Grace and Irwin but their son was very helpful, even gave a quick history of Montreal and the different tourist spots. I would stay here again definitely. 5 stars","9"
"This place is very convenient to stay as it is located downtown. There are many restaurants nearby especially Asian food. Guy-Concordia Station is tight around the corner. The room is clean and has all amenities you need. The host is the most welcoming Airbnb host I have ever had. Highly recommended.","9"
"Espaço adequado,clean e ótima localização!Anfitrioes gentis e disponíveis!","9"
"I think that the room is perfectly fine for short period (from 1 to 5 days) for the hospitality and position of the flat. On the other hand, I will not suggest this room for long period (for at least 5 days ) since none will take care to clean the room (and the private bathroom).","9"
"Great location. Close to the metro station. Very clean. Good communication.","9"
"I stayed here for a week and overall had a good stay. I didn't get to talk to Irwin in person (only through messages) but I talked to Grace and their son quite a few times and both of them were so welcoming, friendly, and helpful.
The location is incredible. The apartment is located near the Concordia University Metro station, as well as a bus stop that will get you to a lot of places. The city in general is very walkable and the location really takes advantage of that - there are quite a few restaurants/cafes/grocery stores within a 15 minute walking distance, and the main downtown shopping area is close too. Vieux Montréal is just a short metro ride away.
The apartment itself is very clean and while the kitchen/dining area is small, it's well laid out and fully equipped. While I didn't use it during my stay, there is an in-unit washer/dryer. The room is a nice size, and I liked that there was a private bathroom attached. The bed was pretty hard, which didn't really bother me but is something to keep in mind. Sheets, a towel, a pillow, some hangers in the closet, toilet paper and body wash were all provided. The air con was awesome too, especially since it gets quite hot/humid in the summer.
My biggest negative staying here was the water pressure. They warned me beforehand that the building was old and therefore the water pressure could be low from time to time, but to just wait a few minutes and try again. Typically this wouldn't bother me at all, but there were two days where I couldn't take a shower because there wasn't water, even after waiting 30 or more minutes. When there was water, there was a light stream - sufficient enough to wash hands, but not much else. I hate leaving negative feedback, and maybe I just came on a bad week, but it was something that bothered me enough where I feel it's important to let other guests know. I truly hope they're able to fix the water pressure problem somehow, because a part from that everything was perfect.","9"
"整洁干净 生活环境很便利 有好多超市和餐馆 美中不足的是洗澡的水压不是很大 但是不影响正常生活","9"
"Grace and Irwin’s place was absolutely perfect—right in the heart of the city, with the metro, restaurants, and grocery stores just a stones throw away. The apartment itself was spotlessly clean, recently refurbished, and very comfortable. Grace was helpful, friendly, and kind her her communication. Would highly recommend and would love to return  on my next visit.","9"
"A perfect experience at Grace & Irwin’s place! A very cozy bedroom of enough space for two or even three adults with a spacious and very clean private bathroom inside. Everything in the room is in a good condition. The WIFI connection is fast and stable. Some previous reviews mentioned that there could be some water pressure issue, but it did not bother me at all during my stay since I found I was able to take the bath every day. The shared living room has an open kitchen with a wide choices of cookers. I was told I could cook there and use anything available.  Grace host me during my stay and she is very friendly, accommodating and responsive. She relied to my questions very quickly and made my check-in and check-out very smooth. The place looks very safe, with electronic code-lock for each private room and another two doors to be locked from outside the building.  The location is also perfect! It is in the downtown Montreal and very near to a number of famous and top-rated  restaurants. It is within around one or two minutes walking distance from a metro station so the traffic is quite convenient as well. In a word, this is a perfect place with perfect host! I will choose this place again if I come back to Montreal next time. 总之,不论从房间的硬件设施,整洁程度,安全性,地理位置以及交通便利程度来看,都很完美｡房东人也很好很负责,今后如果可以的话,还会再次入住｡","9"
"The place is located steps away from Guy Concordia metro which is great for getting around the city.","9"
"very nice place to stay","9"
"I chose Grace and Irwin's place in Montreal because I really liked the apartment they showed and described in the Airbnb website, as well as how close it was to the metro station and a lot of places in downtown Montreal. However, even though being close to this service and the location I just described, I had a lot of trouble with other issues during my stay.

My main problems were the water pressure in the apartment was not good since the first week I arrived to the apartment, and this problem was never given a solution to during my whole stay there. There were several times when I got really late to several appointments at my job, had to cancel plans or reschedule my whole day because the water pressure would be so low that I couldn't take a shower without the water stopping every 2 minutes, and sometimes even for 30 minutes, making it impossible for me to take a whole shower in a small amount of time. Several times I had to write the owners to ask for a solution, since this kept being a bother to me and I only kept being told to be patient and try to understand the situation. During my stay in Montreal, this problem only kept getting worse, both in quantity (every time the amount of water coming out of the shower, bathroom and kitchen sink would be even less) and frequency (it kept happening more and more frequently, frist every week, then every 3 days until it was every day) and what got me really disappointed is that I never felt this situation was handled correctly by the owners. It wasn't until my last week in the apartment that the water situation got so bad that it ran out completely and my roommate and me were left with NO water for 2 days and a half, that one of the owners went by and saw the problem by herself. I didn't like that still, there was no soluton to the problem. During these days, I had to buy several bottles and gallons of water and even suscribe to a gym in order for me to take showers and be able to use a bathroom. It was a problem that really changed the whole perception I had of the apartment as well as the owners' abilities to solve conflicts raised during the stay of a visitor. As I mentioned in one point to the owners, this kind of trouble was never described like this neither in person nor in the Airbnb website, and I think it should be mentioned before someone decides to stay in a new place.

Also, I have to mention that I did not feel comfortable being in the apartment  several times because the owners of the building or part of their family would enter in the apartment and make use of the utensils there (e.g.: the kitchen, washer, drier, etc.) while the guest where there. I made me feel as if I had no privacy and I was not paying for a place to be my home for those weeks, but instead felt as if it was not my apartment and I couldn't feel comfortable there.

Besides this, the apartment is really well located in Downtown Montreal and the location of the metro (1 min walk) is a really nice plus for this building.","9"
"Everything was great!! All shown and told was accurate, and while staying in the appartment everything was better!! I am very happy to have stayed in Le Solano and Simplissimmo team was a 10 !","10"
"I had a great time in Daniel's house. Excellent location, almost in front of the subway and with tons of cafes, bars and restaurants. The room it's exactly as described and as someone noticed in other review, the sheets and blankets are of very quality. 

Daniel is a welcoming guest and gave me excellent suggestions about what to do.

I would stay there again for sure and recommend Daniel's house for anyone.","10"
"Que dire si ce n'est je me suis bien senti chez Daniel. L'appartement est bien tenu, décoré avec gout, spacieux et idéalement situé ! 
Je suis plutôt de tempérament réservé, Daniel a été très gentil et serviable. C'est le genre de personne qui s'adapte à ses hôtes, il est ouvert à la discussion et il n'hésite pas à prendre de son temps pour donner des conseils.

Si je reviens, c'est bien chez lui que j'irai et je vous le recommande. ","10"
"This place was a rare gem and I was lucky enough to stay here for a whole week.

Daniel is truly friendly and honest, and an absolutely natural host. It was obvious he has a genuine interest in people which made him effortlessly accommodating and easy to talk to. The cats were no different, clearly they have learned a lot from him. 

The apartment was beautiful, an incredible space filled with unique décor, furniture, and art, much of which was custom made by Daniel himself. The private room no doubt matched the rest of the place, comfortable, clean, and stylish. 

The location could not be better, with transit in all directions just steps outside (including the Metro) and right in the middle of a lively and creative neighbourhood.

I had a great time here and would highly recommend this place. ","10"
"Daniel was an amazing host and my 4 day stay was absolutely amazing! The room was great and super clean and he opened up his kitchen and laundry room for my use as well. Definitely recommend!","10"
"Daniel was a fabulous host who made me feel very welcome in his home. He graciously accepted my booking on short notice after another AirBnB booking fell through. I ended up feeling lucky as it is hard to imagine finding a better host.

Daniel's apartment was a lovely place to stay. The location was excellent - right in the heart of the Plateau and well connected to down town via public transport. Nearby shops make it easy to self-cater, but there are also plenty of cafes and restaurants if you prefer not to cook. The Mile End is within walking distance, and Patisserie Au Kouign Amann (which makes the best croissants in town) is only a minute away.

Daniel has several rooms available. This one is smaller, but has a desk, something that was particularly useful for me as I was travelling primarily for work.","10"
"Daniel's apartment is absolutely beautiful and charming. It's also in the perfect location for experiencing the best of Montreal. The bedroom itself is quiet, charming, and peaceful - your own little oasis. The bed is also very comfortable, and the room is very dark at night, with no noise from the street -- so it's great for catching up on sleep.

Daniel is a lovely person and it was a joy to meet him and chat over coffee in the mornings. He goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and at home in his apartment, and has even stocked the bedroom with guidebooks to help you plan your trip. 

This was the absolute PERFECT place to stay for a beautiful, peaceful, fun and relaxing week in Montreal. I'm already dreaming about my return :)","10"
"Daniel a été un hôte parfait. Il a su se rendre disponible et est très accueillant. Le séjour chez lui a été très agréable ! Et son appartement est vraiment chaleureux !","10"
"Daniel was the most delightful of hosts. Friendly, welcoming and a perfect balance of giving one personal space, yet also there to have a nice chat with. He's an excellent conversationalist, and it was really nice just to be able to chat casual with him (in French, and of course, he speaks English as well). The apartment and bedroom were spotless and just so cozy during a very cold week. I absolutely loved that my comfy room had its own adjustable thermostat. Daniel's cats are sweet and calm, and quite adorable when they peek their noses outside in the cold snow. You could literally crawl to the metro station from Daniel's place. It's phenomenally located. There's also the bus that goes to the top of the mountain that stops just in front of his place. 
Furthermore, you'll sleep like an angel, as Daniel's place is incredibly quiet (being 2 flights of stairs above the street and set-back a bit as well). The kitchen was fully equipped with plenty of space for one's own food in the cupboards and fridge.
It was one of the most relaxing weeks I've spent in a long time. 
Merci Daniel! :)","10"
"Tout était parfait.
Daniel Provençal est quelqu'un de très chaleureux
J'ai été très bien reçu et tout de suite mis à l'aise
La chambre correspond exactement à la présentation sur le site
Le quartier est très bien placé pour la découverte de Montréal","10"
"Daniel is a very warm and welcoming host; I really appreciated that he took the time to make coffee and sit down with me to talk about Montreal and his travels more generally.  It made me feel a lot more comfortable about staying in his impeccably maintained apartment.  It is a very clean place with two amiable cats, and is peaceful and quiet.  There were two other guests staying there at the same time as me but I didn't even see them, nor hear them!

The area feels very safe and it is extremely close to the Metro station, which is especially useful if you are visiting in freezing midwinter.  I did walk quite a lot even though it was so cold, and I can imagine that in the summer this would be a great base for exploring the city on foot too.  The apartment itself is very warm and snug and there is temperature control in the bedroom so you won't ever be cold indoors.","10"
"L'endroit est super. C'est propre, accueillant, et à deux pas du métro. Bref allez y sans hésiter.","10"
"je suis retourné chez Daniel sans hésiter une seconde. Je savais qu'il

Et je ne me suis pas trompé.","10"
"The experience was wonderful. Daniel is an excellent host and he keeps his home pristine.  His cats are friendly and not intrusive, and the space itself has a great vibe and energy. It was a pleasurable stay while I was in the city. :)","10"
"Daniel was a lovely host! His apartment is beautiful and I am extremely jealous. I only wish I had more time to spend in it.

A++ Would recommend! ","10"
"This was my second stay at Daniel's apartment. Once again I had a great time. Daniel was a very welcoming host and his apartment is perfectly located for exploring all the the Plateau has to offer. His hard work on the balcony has also paid off this spring - it is a lovely spot to sit and enjoy the sunset.","10"
"Excellent location as well as accommodation would definitely come back.","10"
"Super séjour chez Daniel, j'ai réservé au dernier moment et je n'ai pas regretté mon choix ! Tout est comme décrit dans l'annonce ; l'appartement est bien localisé et on s'y trouve très bien. Super expérience.","10"

"Daniel was truly an excellent, kind and attentive host with a beautifully decorated apartment that is situated only steps from the subway in one of the best, liveliest neighborhoods in Montréal. I definitely enjoyed my stay there and interacting with him and would not hesitate staying again on my next trip to Montréal. ","10"
"very great host.  fantastic cook as well","10"
"My stay with Daniel was wonderful.  The place is in the perfect location, is clean, and beautiful.  I have stayed with Daniel twice now and both times I had the feeling that I was staying at a friends house.  

If you are looking for a place to stay look no more.  Daniel's place makes you feel at home away from home. My best reviews for the place and for Daniel. ","10"
"Daniel was a very accommodating and gracious host! The location of his place is right by the Mont-Royal Metro, which is essential for those of us who want to explore Montreal on foot. Additionally, Mont-Royal Ave is a great street, filled with shops, bars, and cafes. The room was warm, comfortable, and perfectly sized for a single traveler. I'll definitely seek out this place the next time I stay in Montreal!","10"
"Great location, great host! Daniel was quick to communicate days before I arrive to make sure he is physically present for my arrival, which he was.  During my stay, he was also very attentive to any needs I might have, by telling me the key attractions and restaurants to go in Montreal.  His place was clean and neat.  I'll definitely stay here again on my next visit to Montreal!","10"
"I felt very very lucky to start my first airbnb experience at Daniel's. The location is superb, metro is just steps away crossing the street. Daniel is my first impression of Montreal, he is always there to help and provide advices such as for good restaurants, easy ways to travel around, etc. I felt very home-welcomed. The place is cozy, neat, clear and quite! I will come back hopefully in Jun(for Summer) and Oct(for Autumn) next year. Daniel's is my first choice, hopefully I will have the luck to book a room then(he is so popular)","10"
"This was my second time staying at Daniel's place in Montreal. It was absolutely delightful. The room is cozy, warm and quiet, with a comfy bed and desk for convenient working with laptop (and great wifi, too!). But even more than that, Daniel is the best of hosts, always ready chit-chat or share a coffee over a conversations. Furthermore, he even prepared a New Year's Eve dinner, as well as a French Toast for New Year's Day brunch. One feels totally at home and at ease chez Daniel. I cannot recommend it more!","10"
"Daniel is absolutely amazing. He is a really welcoming host. His place is super artistic and clean. I would recommend his place to anyone who is considering it.","10"
"Daniel was the prefect host! Welcoming, informative and extremely nice. The apartment is in the best location, just 3 minutes walk from the metro station in a really cool neighborhood with lots of cafes and restaurants. The room was clean, quiet, comfortable bed and enough space for luggage and your stuff, there is even a closet and a desk. I loved the place and loved the cats and will definitely airbnb with Daniel again if I am ever back in Montreal and the place is free! ","10"
"Daniel was very kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable about Montreal. His home was spotless, and in a great neighborhood near many restaurants and just across the street from the Metro station- very convenient! Daniel had great recommendations of places to grab a bite to eat in the neighborhood and also very helpful suggestions about visiting Montreal in general. He kindly made coffee each morning, and offered an extra blanket because the temperatures were so low outside. I look forward to visiting Montreal in the summer and will definitely stay with Daniel again!","10"
"Well this is my second time!!
Same as the first time I enjoyed staying at Daniel he make me feel at home.

He welcomed me with homemade cake.
(Delicious)

I enjoyed my stay 

Thank you for everything ","10"
"I really enjoy staying at Daniel's place. He was very easy to reach before my arrival, and answered my questions. He was very welcoming and friendly during my short stay in Montreal. The place is very neat and looks exactly as listed: very artistic! I love it! The area is safe and perfectly locate it. It's just a few steps away from the subway and has tons of nice cafes, restaurants, book stores, etc. If I go to Montreal again, I would definitely like go to his place again. Thanks Daniel for being so kind!","10"

Best wishes, Daniel. Thank you!","10"
"Daniel was very welcoming. The place is exactly as described. The bed is very comfortable and the place is charming. Highly recommended.","10"
"Daniel was very friendly and gave me tons on information on the city. There were two other guys in the other two bedrooms and they were awesome people too. The apartment was absolutely true to the photos shown and most importantly, it was very clean. There is a bar just three stores down the same block, and my room faces the back alley, so it might be a bit noisy over the weekend though.
The apartment is very conveniently located (close to metro, and two stops from central metro station). I was attending a conference at UQAM and Concordia so that was perfect.
I want to thank Daniel for making me feel really welcomed, especially since this is my first time using airbnb. I definitely hope to visit the city again.","10"
"I had a wonderful stay in Montreal at Daniel's place! He is an outstanding host and works very hard to make sure his guests enjoy their stay. He is very knowledgeable about the city and has great ideas for places to go and things to do. He has many guidebooks and maps he will go through with you, he gave me some great information on the Parc Mont Royal as well as some neighborhood walks. Plus, he makes great coffee and is an excellent chef!   

The apartment is very cozy and well equipped. This bedroom is perfect for solo travelers or students, and is an outstanding value. Be aware that it is not large - however it is very comfortable, there is a closet for clothes, and a desk to read or work. With the desk and wifi I was able to get some work done to meet a deadline while I was gone.   
  
The neighborhood and location are both great. There are shops, restaurants, and a good market all close by. The metro is very close, and Saint-Laurent street and Mont Royal Parc are all just a walk away. I stayed in June for the F1 Grand Prix, and the Plateau neighborhood was a nice change from the normal race crowd and activities. I felt that there were few to no tourists around, so I felt like I was living like a local, which I enjoy. 

Comfortable and fun apartment, wonderful host, and a great location. I hope to stay here again! ","10"
"Bonjour, Gabrielle.
Je viens de passer 10 jours chez Daniel, dans son très agréable appartement du quartier tout aussi extra du Mont Royal. L'appartement est juste à côté du métro, en 20 minutes à pied on est dans le centre en descendant la rue typique de St Denis et  pour ma part j'ai adoré toutes les librairies de proximité. J'en ai relevé 6 dans un rayon de 15 min autour de l'appart.C'était ma première expérience Airbnb et je suis enchantée. Daniel m'a tout de suite très bien accueillie et mise à l'aise. Il m'a montré le quartier, m'a fait profiter de son expérience de Montréalais. Il est disponible, prévenant et en même temps discret. J'occupais la chambre au bout de l'appartement et j'avais tout ce dont j'avais besoin avec plein de petits détails, notamment décoratifs qui font qu'on se sent chez soi. Une japonaise occupait une autre chambre et ça s'est très bien passé, notamment par la capacité de Daniel à concilier les attentes de chacun. Je vous encourage à profiter de cette belle opportunité. Merci Daniel","10"

"Daniel is a fantastic host. Upon arriving he was available to spend some time with me (coffee, walk, ...) without being pushy at all. It was a very warm and nice welcome. He is very helpful and kind. Every encounter was a pleasure. The (small) room (at the back) was just perfect for my needs, and I appreciated the cosy, feeling-at-home kind of atmosphere in the rest of the house.
The location, room, house and host would be my first choice if I would pass by MTL again!","10"
"Daniel was a fantastic host. Quick to communicate and always willing to help where he could beyond just being your host. 

The apartment was exactly as advertised and well kept. Couldn't ask for a better place or location for the value you get here. 

Thanks Daniel!","10"
"Great stay!","10"
"This place is beautiful and is very quiet despite being on a busy main road, across the street from a Metro station. Loved the company of the cats ","10"
"Chez Daniel tout est excellent, "" A home away from Home"", Daniel knows all the happenings in the city, he looks also carefully for the details to make sure you'll have the best and memorable stay... La chambre est cozy, confortable,  calme, propre et en tres bon etat... L'appart est dans un spot cool, tout proche du Metro... C'etait une experience tres agreable... Merci beaucoup Dani... Vraiment le spot ideal a Montreal :) ... ","10"
"Daniel is a great host and bilingual expert of Montreal. He responded very quickly to all messages. Location is perfect for experiencing Montreal. My best recommendations.","10"
"Un appartement magnifique à deux pas de la station de métro Mont-Royal, une chambre parfaite pour mes besoins (périodes de repos en journée, les nuits et les matinées à se préparer tranquillement avant de partir en visites), un quartier extra où l'on a plaisir à déambuler, proximité du charmant Parc de la Fontaine, un accueil très agréable et très plaisant par Daniel, avec une alchimie très réussie entre les moments d'échanges et l'autonomie... Bref, avoir été hébergée chez Daniel compte beaucoup dans l'excellent souvenir que je garde de mon séjour à Montréal.   ","10"
"There aren't enough words to describe how great Daniel is, or how wonderful his place is. The room was everything I could have needed and wanted, and his place overall is warm, welcoming, and exactly as described. I especially loved sitting on the plant-filled terrace chatting with Daniel and the other guests. The location could have been any more convenient, fewer than 200 steps to the metro from his front door, but also dangerously close to Pâtisserie au Kouign Amann! There are also loads of other great places within a short walking distance as well. Daniel is a consummate host, taking me on a walking tour upon my arrival, suggesting endless options for places to go and things to do (his guidebook on here conveniently matched up with a lot of what I wanted to do...trust his insight!), and always being up for a great conversation - always welcomed to a solo traveler. I've already suggested his place to many friends, and I can't wait to return myself!","10"
"Daniel's place is perfect - the room is just as described, small but really comfortable, with a nice big window for fresh air overlooking a quiet back street. And the place is spotless.

The neighbourhood is great, I loved it. It's busy enough that you have eveything you need at your doorstep (including Metro station, 3 stops from the old town), but at the smae time has a great small 'hood feel to it. I really enjoyed walking around and discovering the alleyways, staircases and murals - be sure to make time to explore this area.

Daniel was easy to communicate with and he is very pleasant to chat to and interact with.

I highly recommend it.","10"
"The room is comfortable and pretty.
Very close to metro station and downtown.
The host is nice and considerate!
Good choice to live here. :)","10"
"Wonderful host and great location - you can't go wrong at Daniel's place. Highly recommended!","10"
"Daniel's apartment is just as described and pictured.  Daniel was also a great host making sure that I was comfortable and available for advice or a good chat.  

The area was perfect, very close to the metro and just a quick walk to Mont Royal.

I highly recommend his place for your stay in Montreal!!","10"
"This place is, in a word, AMAZING! Daniel's apartment is a great bang for the buck, located as it is in one of the hippest and liveliest neighborhoods in in the downtown area. It's just a stone's throw from the metro, which gets you just about anywhere you'd want to go. There are cafés, shops, and restaurants galore. The apartment itself has all the charm you would expect of a 110-year-old building, and I spent many delighted mornings having coffee and breakfast on the pleasant outdoor patio. The best part is Daniel, who is without question the most friendly, pleasant, kind, and helpful host I have ever encountered on Airbnb. I felt completely at home in his apartment and greatly enjoyed his company, as well as that of the other guests. I would stay here again anytime; it was exactly the experience that I had been hoping to have in Montreal and I commend this lovely spot to any travelers looking to forge a connection with the city. Daniel is truly a gem!","10"
"Nice little room in a perfect location in Montreal. Daniel is an pleasant and available host","10"
"Daniel's place is wonderful, surrounded by bakeries and walking distance to many attractions. It was a leisure walk up to Mont Royal Park and the metro station is a stone's throw away. The room and home were also true to the pictures. I highly recommend staying at Daniel's!","10"
"Daniel, put simply, is a consummate host. This is my first Airbnb experience and he has set the bar high. From the get-go, he was proactive in communicating with his guests. For example, by giving me directions to his place and informing me that the roads were closed due to a festival before I arrived, so that I could plan an alternative route to his place. He even greeted me at the door and gave me a quick tour around Montreal as it was my first time visiting Quebec. Bilingual and affable, Daniel ensures that his guests are comfortably well-settled, especially for English speakers who may have difficulties navigating around Montreal. His apartment is clean and his two cats, Paco and Baboo, are absolutely adorable. Depending on your preferences, Daniel can be a guide and friend, or simply a host if you wish it be. It is his versatile approach to hosting that impresses me the most.

Location-wise, his place is steps away from the Mont-Royal métro and in the heart of the French Ghetto. Good food is found everywhere. La Banquise and Fameux for Poutine, L'Avenue for brunch, Yokato Yokabai for ramen, pâtisserie kouign aman and plenty more. For bibliophiles, there is a ton of francophone bookshops nearby.

In short, I had a pleasant stay and got to experience a (very) local taste of Montreal. Merci beaucoup, Daniel!","10"
"房东丹尼尔健谈,能提供这个城市的有用信息,与房东交流是一件愉快的事情｡性价比超高,强烈推荐!","10"
"Le logement est propre, calme au cœur du plateau (métro Mont royal juste à coté).
Le propriétaire est très accueillant et à l'écoute. Se fut un séjour agréable. Je recommande les yeux fermés !","10"
"Daniel is a truly fantastic host. He was very helpful, kind, and thoughtful in his communication and thoughts on what to do in Montreal. His place is clean, elegant, bright, and even better than advertised. The location is perfect--right near Mont Royal subway stop and close to ample street parking in Le Plateau. The rooms are well-lit and clean and the apartment has a friendly, airy vibe. The room was outfitted with lamps and a towel and good bedding. If you are staying in Montreal, I cannot recommend this place enough.","10"
"La casa de daniel es excelente. Super bien ubicada con el sistema de transporte y a unos pasos del Mont Royal. Daniel es un super host. La casa limpia. Impecable.","10"
"Daniel's place is very lovely, cozy and in a great location. Daniel is very attentive and response to guests's need. If I come back to Montreal will definitely stay with him again.","10"
"Great host and excellenet location! Highly recommend this place.","10"
"The perfect Iocation: surrounded by restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and a subway station! And yet: you wiII aIways get a perfect night's sIeep in this amazingIy quiet pIace. Bonus: DanieI is such a sincere & down-to-earth host! :)","10"
"I spent 3 weeks in Daniel's house. Place is really convenient, everything is around and very close, metro, restaurant, shops.... House is clean, nice and welcoming, bedroom is small but it feels good inside, bed is good too. 
Only bad point to me, from the bedroom, internet wifi is really really terrible, I am an internet lover, so it was very annoying. But in the living room there is no problem.
Daniel is a very kind and nice person, he will make you comfortable in his house.","10"
"Très bon séjour chez Daniel où je suis resté deux semaines. Logement idéalement placé (proximité du métro et de nombreux commerces).

Daniel vous accueillera chaleureusement et n'hésitera pas à vous aider si vous avez des questions pratiques sur la vie à Montréal.","10"
"Daniel is wonderful ! A kind, generous, creative and intuitive person. He will make you feel welcome and give you any tips you need for your trip, as well as be intuitive to you and your needs if you want to stay private. 

The superhost title is so well deserved. 

His home quickly becomes your home - it is beautifully laid out, clean, tidy and a great place to spend time in, or arrive back to after a day of sightseeing / work.

It is right by the subway so only a 2/3mins way. Near by restaurants and bars, shops, swimming pool, park ! Everything. 

I cannot recommend daniels air bnb more highly.

Stay here ! You won't be disappointed

"I honestly don't think you will find a better place and host in Montreal.  Great location, affordable, clean, well-appointed and Daniel is a superb host who will make you feel at home. A special place.","10"
"Daniel’s place has great location! Easy to commute to everywhere you need to go in Montreal! He’s a great host, always available to help and talk! I would strongly suggest everyone who comes to visit stay at his place!","10"
"Daniel's apartment is located in an awesome neighbourhood, really close to subway, bus stop, supermarket, and other services.
I actually felt like I was home at Daniel's apartment. Daniel is an amazing landlord, always available to help and make your stay comfortable!
I'd strongly suggest everyone who comes to visit MTL staying at Daniel's place.
Thank you, Daniel :)","10"
"Daniel is really kindly and welcome, also specialized at making cake! The house feels home, and the kitchen is wonderful, I love the pan a lot :D also cats are adorable ~~I highly recommend","10"
"Je peux affirmer, sans le moindre doute, que le séjour chez Daniel a été le meilleur que j'ai jamais eu. 
La maison est parfaite. Extrêmement propre, spacieuse et bien meublé;  j'ai trouvé tout ce dont j'avais besoin et plus. Les transports en commun sont vraiment au coin de la rue: deux minutes à pied pour aller à la station de métro et l'arrêt de bus.
Toujours à distance de marche il y a de nombreux supermarchés, restaurants et magasins de toutes sortes.
Daniel est un super host et une personne extraordinaire. Grâce à lui, vous vous sentez immédiatement à l'aise; sa gentillesse est incroyable. Il prend vraiment soin de ses invités et il est toujours disponible pour vous aider, vous donner des conseils ou simplement pour parler de n'importe quoi. Je suis vraiment heureux de l'avoir connu.
En outre, il est un excellent cuisinier! J'ai eu la chance de goûter ses gâteaux: délicieux!
Enfin je veux aussi parler de Paco et Babou (ses deux chats): je n'avais jamais rencontré des chats si doux et adorables.
Pour conclure, Daniel et sa maison méritent bien plus que 5 étoiles!","10"
"Daniel's home is located in a beautfiul area of Motreal. The appartment itself is beautiful and cozy, also very clean and the kitchen is very well equipped. I had a great time, talking to Daniel and his flatmate. Both were always very welcoming and had some nice suggestions about what to do and what to see. I really enjoyed my time there and would recommend it to anyone!","10"
"Catherine's home was clean, conveniently located, and well appointed. Being right across from the market and in Little Italy is a huge plus. We had a great stay!","9"
"Une expérience superbe chez Catherine! Les photos ne font pas justice, on à vraiment aimez notre séjour- elle à vraiment du style cette femme :)
J'ai hâte de retourner <3","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 52 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"The place was perfect, we spent there 5 days and had the feeling to be home. Well equipped with all you can find to cook or to clean, the apartment is well located for exploring Montreal. Catherine is a great host, easily reachable. We did not meet her but she made things easy for us with clear instructions. Absolutely recommended. 
","9"
"The apartment was great (my partner exclaimed on our first day there that it was like the love child of Salvador Dali and Frida Kahlo) and being right across from the Jean Talon Market is a huge perk.  We were able to go shopping at the market and then cook rather than eating out for every meal.   Everything was clean and bright and colorful, and we had no problems finding the apartment or getting around the city- it's just two blocks from the metro station.   Catherine was very helpful and we really enjoyed our stay, it made me want to move to Montreal!","9"
"Le logement était comme décrit. L'emplacement près du marché Jean talon est vraiment un PLUS. Tout était propre et fonctionnel...
Joli appart. Aucun contact avec l'hôte mais une note descriptive des lieux était somme toute suffisante.","9"
"I didn't have a chance to meet Catherine but she gave me the proper instructions on how to get into the apartment with ease. I really enjoyed my stay and felt like I had plenty of space. The apartment was equipped will all the essential needs for a week long stay. Before I arrived, she had a family of 4 staying for an extend period of time. There was a little hiccup with the cleaning person getting around to the apartment before my stay. Nevertheless, Catherine apologized and rectified the situation by having them coming as soon as possible and refunding me for 2 nights. It was an understandable situation with the last guests staying so long and leaving the day I am arriving. I definitely would stay again and love the decor! The neighborhood is a great location by the Jean Talon Market and Metro station within steps.  ","9"
"the apartment was cute and cozy and the location was amazing. We were a short walk to the metro, to the Jean Talon market and to little Italy. If you are ok with long walks we even walked to the Mile end neighborhood one night. Buses are easy to from the apartment. Kitchen had all the utensils needed to cook some meals (which we especially since Milano market was nearby and we kept buying groceries just because everything there was so tempting!). Didn't meet Catherine but getting the keys was easy. A great place to stay!","9"
"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Catherine mais la communication a été très bonne (avant et pendant) le séjour. L'arrivée s'est déroulée très facilement. Les photos sont fidèles à la réalité quoique qu'elles ne font pas justice au logement. Très bien agencé, avec tout le nécessaire de cuisine (notamment une machine à expresso !!!! Un bonheur !!!). Couleurs vives et décorations ""Frida Kahlo"" :). Literie super confortable ! L'emplacement est GÉ-NI-AL  : à deux pas du marché Jean Talon, à 5 min à peine à pied de la station de métro Jean Talon, où il y a un supermarché Métro. Supermarché Provigo à 15 à pied environ. Rue calme et pas trop passagère, bien qu'à côtés de toutes les nécessités. Je recommande vivement !","9"
"Our experience in Catherine's place was really good. We spent a month there, and the apartment is just perfect for a long or short stay. The pictures don't do justice to the size of the place. We loved the neighborhood, there is a great big market right next to her place and also lot's of amazing restaurants. It's a privileged area I believe, because it's far enough from the center for things to be cheaper but you still have lots of options to eat. The location is just a little far from the tourist attractions, around 20-30 minutes by subway to each one, but her place is right next to the subway station, which is awesome!","9"
"Catherine's apartment is very vibrantly decorated, with each room a different bright colour and bold decorations. Our favourite thing about the apartment was the nice big kitchen, which was equipped with good cookware and a nice little espresso machine. There were many negative aspects about our stay. When we first arrived, there was no information about internet or other infos, so we had to search for an internet cafe to be able to get in contact with Catherine. We then had to wait quite some time before getting an answer -- an overall frustrating experience. We stayed in the flat for a month in the winter and had to go up precarious steps each day. It was our responsibility to shovel the steps and remove the ice, but no shovel was provided. Another major issue was the broken window in the bedroom. It was covered with plastic, which kept the heat in very well, but it didn't block any of the noise coming from the street, which was a problem some nights. Another thing to keep in mind is that only one set of keys was provided. This was quite inconvenient for us because we were 2 people. In general, whenever we had an issue, we were told to solve it ourselves. We managed to figure things out in the end, and the location close to the metro and nice restaurants made up for many of our frustrations. ","9"
"We really enjoyed our stay. Catherine's place was warm and inviting, tidy, clean and well-maintained, and we appreciated that she had made room for us to keep our stuff. We also appreciated the well-supplied kitchen, so we could cook with the nice pots and pans, and use the espresso machine. the neighbourhood is also great. You're right next to Jean-Talon Market, which is the ideal place to get fresh groceries. ","9"
"Nice place !","9"
"Agréable logement.  Facilité en tout points de vue, transport, magasin , marché, restos. Quartier agréable. A recommander sans hésitation. ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Catherine gave great directions from the airport!
The home was in great location an great heating!
It has everything you need for any length stay. 
Kitchen cupboard doors wont stay shut (bluetac must have been used in pics to keep the shut lol) an no handles on drawers an doors. My personal feeling about the bed placement ..I would like to be able to get around it. Need better tv reception. 
Overall the home needs some repairs..not quiet suitable (in my opinion) to rent out as is.","9"

"Le séjour à Montréal dans l'appartement de Catherine à été très agréable.
Son appartement est très bien situé, à 2 pas du métro Jean Talon.

J'ai d'ailleurs beaucoup apprécié la touche de décoration avec Frida Kahlo, qui est présente dans toutes les pièces de l'appartement.","9"
"Bonjour,
Nous avons passe 15 jours formidables à Montréal, et la maison de Pascale y est pour beaucoup!
En effet, la maison est parfaite pour y sejourner en famille. Elle est grande, tres confortable, avec beaucoup de charme, et très fonctionnelle. Elle est en plus idéalement placée dans le cœur de little italy, du métro, des commerces (Traditions, Jean Coutu, la rue St Hubert...) et petits restaurants sympathiques (Les empoteuses huuum). Pour rajouter a cela, Pascale a été une précieuse hôte avec ses explications, sa flexibilité et sa gentillesse. Tout ceci nous a permis de vivre l aventure de l intérieur, avec le sentiment d être de vrais québécois. 
En un seul mot : foncez!","9"
"Nous n'avons pas beaucoup hésité avant de contacter Pascale et Alex et n'avons pas été déçus, au contraire. La maison est propre, bien organisée et accueillante, très bien placée dans un quartier agréable et chaleureux. Avec nos enfants, nous avons réellement apprécié cet hébergement et nous promettons d'y retourner. D'après notre expérience, c'était une chance de goûter à la vie montréalaise depuis le quartier de la Petite Patrie. La ruelle où ils ont pu jouer en toute sécurité et laisser leurs dessins, le jardin et l'ambiance du quartier ont particulièrement marqué nos enfants qui ne voulaient pas quitter. L'hospitalité de Pascale et Alex, leur disponibilité et leur simplicité ont, qui plus est, rajouté à notre plaisir de loger chez eux. Il n'y a pas de questions à se poser pour les contacter. C'était super. Merci à toute la famille. ","9"
"Sympathique emplacement, idéal pour petite famille... Etienne, l'hôte, est agréable (nous avons communiqué par téléphone et par écrit), il a répondu rapidement à mes questionnements.

Le quartier Villeray est un endroit avec un charme indéniable, le marché Jean-Talon (surtout l'été) en est le coeur.","9"
"L'appartement d'Etienne est tel que décris dans l'annonce, pas de mauvaise surprise. Nous avons communiqué par messages et tout s'est très bien passé, en plus Etienne nous avait laissé une petite attention de bienvenue et un conseil de visite du marché Talon dans le quartier. Très bon séjour, appartement proche du métro, calme et idéal pour 4. Je recommande!!","9"
"J'ai passé 2 jours dans l'appartement d'Etienne qui était très bien situé, à côté du métro et de plusieurs petits cafés, l'appartement est grand et lumineux, et surtout le lit est incroyablement confortable! La communication était très simple avec Etienne, qui est super sympa. Tout était parfait, je recommende!","9"

"This place was in a very nice quiet area of the city that isn’t far from local restaurants and culture.  Beds were comfortable and space was bright and clean - pleasantly surprised with the bed in the kids room for an adult to sleep in so me and my friend had 2 separate rooms to sleep in.  Recommended!","9"

À proximité du métro et des commerces .

"Patrick is a wonderful host and his condo is absolutely perfect for anyone traveling to Montreal and looking to be near restaurants and shops. We walked to downtown Eaton Center from his place easily and there was much to see and eat also walking distance. I would highly recommend.","10"
"Patrick's condo is absolutely gorgeous! It was perfect and exactly as described. The location was wonderful. The only issue we had was on getting the key, but we were able to drive to go get it. Thank you for letting us stay.","10"
"The place was very nice and clean in a new building, about a 10 min walk from the downtown core. Patrick's friend Vivian was very helpful and courteous. I would definitely stay here again. ","10"
"The condo was very nice, clean, and it was nice to have access to some movies etc. for night time. Although Patrick wasn't there Viviane, his friend, coordinated key drop-offs and was very nice and helpful. Location was nice, within about 6-8 minutes of the Berri UQAM metro station , and a 10-30 minute walk from a lot of things to do in the city. There was some construction near the apartment (normal for spring / summer in montreal) but it was very well insulated from the sound. Would recommend to anyone who needs a place to stay, underground parking was also a big plus.","10"
"Patrick's condo was exactly as described and the whole place was amazingly quiet given its location, right downtown Montréal. Patrick was also very accommodating with us and I we enjoyed our stay!","10"
"The apartment was well-located, modern, comfortable and clean. ","10"
"We really enjoyed our stay at Patrick's place - it was easy to communicate with him and the place itself was really clean. The building is new so all the amenities are nicely done and it feels safe. You're close to St. Catherine's as well as St. Laurent, it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to the metro... the only small issue being that you are also close to a few sketchier bars where there are some sketchier people. The bed was not comfortable but we would otherwise highly recommend Patrick for anyone thinking of a future visit! ","10"
"Patrick's condo is in a good location, right around the corner from Saint Catherine Street.  The area is convenient with shops, restaurants, bars, and supermarket.  The condo has all the amenities for a long stay.  It was a comfortable (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Patrick was quick and easy.  I would recommend staying in Patrick’s condo for anyone visiting Montreal.","10"

Communication was easy and quick with Patrick and, as he was gone on vacation, his nice friends were there and flexible enough to coordinate our arrival / departure for the keys. We definitely recommend Patrick's condo for a perfect stay in Montreal :)","10"
"Patrick's place was perfect, just like the pictures. No issues getting they keys at all- one of Patrick's friends met us out front when we arrived, showed us up to and around the apartment.
It was freshly cleaned and all basics were supplied, and the kitchen was fully decked out too (we didn't do any cooking but would have been set if we had).
The location was pretty amazing-we were walking distance from almost everything including restaurants, shopping, festivals and all!
I would definitely recommend Patrick's place for your next Montreal stay, I know we'll be staying again for sure :)","10"

I was almost an hour late arriving but Patrick's rep waited patiently and was really nice and helpful with directions. ","10"

"Patrick is a great host.Even though we did not meet him he was always there to help and quick to reply to any of our queries. His friend Bruce helped us checkin which was very smooth. Patrick's apartment is very central and we literally walked to most of Montreal's prime attractions. The apartment is fully equipped for a perfect stay in a gorgeous city like Montreal. Highly recommend it.","10"
"Patrick's condo was awesome and in a great location close to a major metro station which made touring the city super convenient. He was very hospitable and hastily answered any questions we had. Thanks again Patrick!","10"
"Patrick's place was just perfect - ideally located in the center of the city, near public transport and convenient to many of the local attractions.  He couldn't meet me for check-in but made alternate arrangements that worked out just fine.  He was even kind enough to allow me a late check-out on Sunday.  
Pat provided a few brochures and maps of the area, and his guidebook on airbnb was really helpful, both for neighborhood convenience stores and best things to visit in Montreal. ","10"
"It's a nice modern apartment in a convenient location, walkable to all tourist spots in central Montreal. You have everything you need in the apartment. One thing to bear in mind is that this is clearly the host's home for some or most of the time, and you will find his clothes in the closet, his food in the fridge etc. Check in and out was fine.","10"
"Apartment is in a very great location. Few mins walk to old Montreal, subway station and china town. We have never met the host, but her sister was very nice. Very flexible with check in and check out time.   Parking is also included. ","10"

The apartment is bright, modern, very clean and well equipped. We are travelling with an 11month old and this was also her favourite stop!

Location is great, on the doorstep of a metro station and the famous  Jean Talon market.

I would not hesitate in recommending if you are visiting Montreal.","10"

"Nous avons adoré notre séjour chez Alexandre et Bénédicte. Nous nous sommes vraiment sentis comme à la maison.  Bénédicte était là à notre arrivée et nous a tout indiqué. L appartement est spacieux, agréable, propre et très bien situé dans la ville. Alexandre et Bénédicte sont des hôtes très disponibles avec qui il est très facile d échanger. Merci à vous,  sans oublier la petite Clémence, adorable. ","10"
"We were profusely welcomed upon our arrival at Alexandre's beautiful flat. It is precisely as depicted in the picture and extravagantly comfortable. Of particular note is the outdoor space at the back which is shade dappled and lovely in what could be perceived as a back alley but, courtesy of some plantings and an overhanging tree, is transformed into an idyllic outdoor deck. As mentioned, indoors is equally calm and comfortable. The neighbourhood is an up and coming part of the city with lots of restaurants, a grocery store and shops nearby. Also easily accessible to the downtown of Montreal, especially once the metro is up and running again.","10"
"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour au coeur d'un quartier typique de Montréal. l'appartement est très spacieux et très bien équipé, à proximité des transports, cerise sur le gâteau: la terrasse à l'arrière pour de bons moments de détente en fin de journée après avoir parcourue la ville. À proximité: la rue St-Hubert vaut le coup d'œil. ","10"
"Première expérience d'Airbnb très positive. Les échanges avec Bénédicte très cordiaux. L'appartement super ! d'abord super propre, moderne, avec tout le nécessaire pour cuisiner, truc sympa c'est qu'ils mettent à disposition les produits pour lave-linge et lave-vaisselle.

"Bel appartement très spacieux et très bien équipé, à proximité du métro avec une agréable terrasse à l'arrière. Même si nous n'avons pas rencontré les propriétaires, tout a été très bien organisé pour faciliter notre séjour (système de remise de clés très pratique, instructions claires dans l'appartement). Propriétaires très prévenants (contact régulier par e-mail). Nous le recommandons sans hésiter ! ","10"

"We had a phenomenal time at Alexandre's place. Not only were the pictures accurate, the hosts went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. The location was beyond perfect and the apartment was just amazing! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again - this is probably my best Airbnb experience so far. Thank you Alexandre for hosting us in your beautiful home!","10"
"Merci à Bénédicte et Alexandre pour les réponses rapides aux sms que nous leur avons envoyés pour certaines questions que nous avions lors de notre séjour.
Merci à eux pour l'aménagement horaire également.
L'appartement est superbe et très bien aménagé et équipé.
Nous avons passé 2 jours supers.
Il est bien situé à seulement 100 m d'une station de métro qui mène au centre en 10'.
Parking possible proche.
Idéal pour visiter la ville soit via métro soit en voiture.
Merci pour ce séjour
Bien à vous
Hugo, Christine et Xavier","10"

Strongly recommend it.","10"
"Nous sommes une famille avec deux enfants, nous avons passé deux semaines dans ce magnifique appartement très propre et bien situé, juste en face du métro. Il est très bien équipé et aménagé, parfait pour une famille. Le quartier est calme et avec plusieurs parcs à côté.
Nous y avons passé un très bon séjour dans le confort total. Les propriétaires ont laissé un guide détaillé avec toutes les explications nécessaires. De plus ils étaient disponibles à tout moment pour répondre à nos questions. Nous y retournerions avec grand plaisir.

"Maria's apartment in Plateau was perfect for our stay in Montreal! The apartment is very spacious, well decorated, and stocked with everything you could need during your stay. Maria met us on time and showed us everything we needed to know about the place. It also features a beautiful balcony and backyard. The location is perfect for exploring Montreal and close to grocery stores, trendy restaurants, bars and shopping. I would recommend this apartment to anyone.","9"
"L'appartement est très agréable et il y'a une superbe terrasse ! Maria a été très accueillante et aux petits soins !","9"

"Très bon rapport avec Maria. Beaucoup de flexibilité. Très bien situé. Merci !","9"
"Lovely place in a wonderful location!","9"
"L'appartement de Marìa est situé à proximité des meilleures boutiques et restaurants sur le plateau. Il est donc facile de se déplacer à pied. La communication avec Marìa est claire et rapide. Elle fournit des instructions détaillées. Elle a aussi accommodé notre chien durant notre séjour. La cours arrière est une belle addition. De plus, il y a une petit parc gazonné à proximité.","9"
"All good . Thanks Maria","9"

"A clean, comfortable apartment on a quiet street in the heart of things.
When I arrived Maria was there saving me a parking space directly in front of my door! Maria is great, full of life and enthusiasm.","9"
"I didn’t meet Maria but she was quick to communicate by text. Overall the place was clean but lacked some comforts such as extra pillows and blankets. A small table and chairs would have been nice on the balcony for outside dining. I would suggest bringing tea/coffee to get your day started. A list of local cafes in the neighbourhood would have been helpful as well as the nearest SAQ, grocery store and Metro station. 
I discovered a fabulous cafe a block away called Neve’s. A wonderful way to start your day. As a rule, Montrealers are super friendly and helpful. The Plateau is a great place to discover. Maria’s Place is well-situated.","9"
"Je suis resté un mois et demi dans l’appartement de Maria pour une mission à Montréal. 

Très bien placé tout proche de l’angle hôtel de ville et Rachel, dans une rue calme mais quartier animé, à 7/8 minutes à pied du métro, 10 min à pied du Mont-Royal, 5 min à pied des commerces, boulangeries etc.  

Le quartier est très chouette avec de jolis cafés à 2 min à pied (Névé, Santropol, Réplika), de supers restaurants (l’Express, le Pied de Cochon, le Filet, etc.), il y a même un loueur de smokings à 15 min à pied en cas de soirée habillée pour les visiteurs (maison Waxman), je n’aurais pas voulu vivre ailleurs.

L’appartement ensuite : totalement authentique, en rapport avec Maria, une hôte pleine de vie, très réactive et soucieuse du bien être de ses locataires. Photos fidèles.
Aucun problème relevé durant le séjour, Maria a même instantanément augmenté le débit Internet à ma demande. L’appartement est traversant, ce qui le rend très agréable. Étant présent en hiver je n’ai pas profité de la terrasse mais un point extérieur reste précieux ! 

Je recommanderais les yeux fermés si vous restez un long moment à Montréal.","9"
"perfect location","9"
"Maria’s place was lovely. It is in an old building as she states, so stairs are steep and narrow and not a lot of room when you open the door but when you get to the top it is worth it! We where there for the Grand Prix, so easy access to metro to get to the track. A bit further away from all the other action going on in Old Montréal. We managed to get tickets for the Aura at the Basilica and can highly recommend it!","9"
"Un adorable appartement deux pièces et cuisine avec une petite terrasse, beaucoup de charme, le tout aménagé avec soin et goût, dans une propreté sans faute et un sens parfait de l’accueil (y compris dans la présence de Maria pour  nous aider à l’arrivée). En plus, l’appartement est situé dans un quartier TRÈS vivant et agréable ( Le Plateau, près du métro, à quelques minutes du centre historique , intéressant, mais très surpeuplé). Beaucoup de petits restos et bars vraiment agréables. BREF : VRAIMENT TRÈS RECOMMANDé à Montréal.

"Maria is a wonderful host. She pays attention to every single detail. She is one of the friendliest and more honest host I have met. The place has a wonderful vibe. I slept so peacefully. The neighborhood is wonderful. I love walking to the cafes and restaurants and to Parc La Fontaine. I recommend Maria's place in the strongest terms. Thank you, Maria, for being such an attentive host.","9"
"This is the most interesting part of Montreal, and Maria’s place is the perfect base. It’s comfortable, light, private, has all you need - including organic toiletries - and is ideal especially if you’re traveling solo. Maria’s plants are all thriving too; you can tell this is someone’s home and even though she’s not there, she treats you like a real guest. This year she added ceiling fans, so even as a repeat guest, it exceeded my expectations! Great communication and would stay every time I return to Mtl.","9"
"My stay in Maria's place was absolutely fantastic. Check-in was easy and Maria was always available to answer any questions. I could not have asked for a better host. The apartment is spacious, incredibly clean, very well decorated, and has all the amenities you could want. The neighborhood is full of cafes, restaurants, shops. Thank you, Maria!","9"
"Good Sized Apartment. Older building - like most of Montreal.  Simple, but complete kitchen.  Steep stairs entering,  but we didn't mind.  Wonderful location in the middle of Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood.  Lots of great stuff within walking distance.   Communication with Maria was excellent.","9"
"Très bon contact avec Denis et Kosta, toujours disponibles pour aide, conseils sur la ville.
L'appartement est spacieux, bien fonctionnel, propre, calme, situé entre 2 stations de métro (Plamondon et Côte des Neiges), à 10min à pieds de tous commerces et restaurants, à 20min du centre de Montréal en métro.
Nous gardons un très bon souvenir de notre séjour chez Denis.","10"
"Denis is an excellent host always willing to go the extra mile and accomodating to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. The apartment is clean, spacious and extremely comfortable. It is situated in a peaceful neighbourhood. I would highly recommend anyone looking to stay in a ""home away from home"" and if you are on a stay long in Montreal, this is definitely better than staying in a hotel.  It is walking distance to Metro (subway), eatries and supermarkets. ","10"
"Denis Kash's houese is a very nice place to stay in Montreal. Next time I will choice it again without any hesitate.","10"
"Host lives nearby and was eager to be helpful. Our son enjoyed playing in the back yard. Apartment had everything we needed for enjoying our stay. Plenty of linens, cookware and cable channels. Nice neighborhood, convenient to bus, Metro, and parks. Parking was on the street, but was never too crowded to find a convenient space. We heartily recommend this aparent and host. ","10"
"Amazing host, looks out for you. Spacious clean apartment. Won't hesitate to book this place again.","10"
"Very clean place and excellent host. A bus that runs downtown is close by and subway is a few blocks away. Enjoy our stay. One queen bed, one single bed and 2 couches in the living room","10"
"Denis was out of town but his father-in-law Kostas made us feel very welcome, even offering to drive us downtown on our first night!  The apartment itself was comfortable and located in a nice, diverse neighborhood with easy access to buses (5 minute walk away) and the metro (10-15 minute walk away).  Street parking was easy, we usually found a spot right in front of the house.  Would stay with again, thanks!","10"

"My Family really enjoyed staying in Denis house! His father was Very friendly and showed all of the house and neighborhood, explaining all the things and giving tips about the city! All the neighborhood is Very kind, we made even dog friends there. 
Furthermore, the house was clean and cozy, Very close to wallmart and other stores! Greatly recomended!","10"
"We had a good time at Denis apartment, location is very good, beds are comfortable and kitchen has everything you need to prepare breakfast. Apartment was clean.","10"
"I had a good stay in Montreal.   I was by myself so the apartment felt very spacious.  Walking distance to many shops and restaurants.

Only downside for my trip was the bed was more firm then I like so I didn't sleep great but I know different people have different bed firmness preferences.  ","10"
"This was our first time in Canada, and instead of renting Denis's place for vacation we rented it to be our home for the 1st month as new residents in Canada. We enjoyed every minute in the appartment and the area is close to everything. The appartment has everything you need in order to be your house and the hosts are extraordinaire. Thank you so much for having us, and allowing us to call your appartment ""Our Home"". This space will not be sufficient to describe how me and my family felt during our stay. ","10"
"This upstairs apartment is in an older, very quiet, and well-established part of Montreal. It is on a lovely tree-lined street, and is very close (within a few blocks) to grocery stores and restaurants. The apartment itself is spotlessly clean, very spacious, and well-lit by natural light. When you look out the living room and kitchen windows, you see lots of trees. There is a very nice back deck just off the kitchen if you want to have a barbecue. The TV is excellent (with over 1000 channels). The owner warmly welcomed us to the apartment and showed us all the amenities and supplies in the place, and I must say that they have gone to great lengths to anticipate every need we could possibly have. They were available in person, and by phone and email, every time we had a question. A very relaxing place to stay! ","10"
"This home was very very pleasant to stay in. We were met by Kosta, Denis Dad who lives downstairs. VERY VERY friendly gentleman who made us feel so welcome and so at home. As soon as we arrived (we were very exhausted) but he showed us everything, and told us if we needed anything he is more than happy to be of help. 

The home is in a prime location right by a main boulevard - so really you are just a few steps away to access public transit or tons of restaurants, markets etc. Neighborhood was very quiet, lots of families so very very safe. 

The home was very comfortable, TV had plenty of options, kitchen and dining area were pleasant and beds were very comfortable. 

When we left Kosta even washed our car! So nice of him!

We had a short stay but would definitely come back. ","10"
"Mes parents ont séjourné durant une semaine dans le logement de Denis et sa famille, ils y ont énormément apprécié leur séjour et ont particulièrement été touchés par la gentillesse de la famille. 
Même si Denis et sa famille traversaient un moment délicat, ces derniers se sont toujours montrés accessibles, chaleureux et attentifs aux besoins de mes parents. Denis et sa famille se sont également montrés très flexibles en terme d’accommodements avec mes parents. Le logement est très spacieux, propre, et à très bien situé (à proximité des transports et de plusieurs commodités sur Côte-des-Neiges). Je conseillerai sans hésiter ce logement à n'importe qui.","10"
"We were not typical visitors. I grew up in Montreal and I was returning in order to spend time with a sick elderly relative. We chose the location as it is within walking distance of the hospital. I was grateful that we were able to be close by.
Kosta met us at the door. He was most welcoming. He gave us a thorough tour of the apartment. It certainly fit all of our needs. We didn't  need a description of Montreal and all that is available there. I know he hoped to be more involved, however our situation was different and we were anxious to get to St. Mary's hospital.","10"
"Un grand merci à Kostas qui nous a accueillis à bras ouverts dans son très bel appartement ! Tout était parfaitement conforme à la présentation, très spacieux et très bien équipé. Nous avons passé un merveilleux séjour à Montréal et notre hôte a toujours été disponible pour nous prodiguer ses bons conseils et ses adresses ! Merci encore et peut-être à bientôt ! Sophie, Christophe & Christine","10"
"Comfortable, clean place near public transportation (the 165 bus comes very frequently, so it makes access to the city and to the nearest metro stop very easy). Great communication with the host, who was available and ready to help with whatever we needed.","10"
"The space is the upper floor of a duplex, on a quiet street in central Montreal. Kosta (the owner's father who lives on the lower floor) was very helpful, both for check-in and whenever we had a question. The apartment is very comfortable and well-equipped - feels like a real home. The main bed is quite good (a bit on the firm side) and there are lots of towels. Strong wifi. We were only there for a couple of days, but our stay was very pleasant. ","10"
"Un accueil très  chaleureux. Kosta et sa femme sont  forts aimables . L'appartement est spacieux et le quartier très calme  . Nous avons passé un très bon séjour  et je recommanderai à tous cette bonne adresse.","10"

The interior wasted same as the descriptions which is spacious and clean. ","10"
"Loved staying here! Loved the privacy, space and cleanliness. Everything was spotless, the sheets and towels were so fresh, the neighborhood was lovely, safe and quiet. We were 20 minutes from downtown with plenty of transportation options, just had a fantastic time,  highly recommend this place, thank you Kosta!","10"
"Nous sommes ravis d'avoir fait connaissance de Denis et de sa famille, tous aussi accueillants et sympathiques. Leur dévouement au bien être de leurs visiteurs est agréable et rend le séjour confortable. L'appartement est bien proportionné et surtout bien localisé dans un quartier calme, ainsi que proche des commerces et principaux modes de transport. Nous avons particulièrement bien apprécié notre séjour et le recommandons vivement. Au plaisir d'une prochaine venue à Montréal. ","10"
"The place was very clean and had easy access to public transit. Kostas was nice and helpful. The apartment is on the second floor and it has a flight of stairs, that was the only challenge we had since we travelled with a young child, but it's easy enough to block to prevent falls. Overall, a great stay.","10"
"Bel appartement, spacieux, equipée, calme, et propre. Je le conseil.","10"
"Loved the stay. Fit my whole family Comfortably. This apartment is in a vibrant local community part of Montreal full of shops, restaurants, parks and even a famous landmark.

 The place was very clean, fully stocked kitchen, and has a large balcony with a nice view.
Great apartment, great area, great host. Highly recommended.","10"
"This place was amazing!
The pictures do not do justice to the actual size of the appartment. Very spacious with lots of ammenities. 5 minute walk to the subway (metro) which gives access to the whole city. Very quiet and very safe neighbourhood as well. Definitely coming back on a future visit to Montreal","10"
"We really loved Kosta and Denis' place! We were a family of 4 with a 4 and 7 year old and we felt right at home in the apartment. The apartment was clean and spacious. There were ceiling fans in most rooms which helped us not need the air conditioner at all during our stay. The terrace overlooks a beautifully landscaped (by Kosta) backyard.  Kosta and his wife were very friendly with us and helpful with any questions we had. 

The best features for us with the kids were the laundry, Netflix, Wi-Fi and its closeness to Parc Kent, which has a playground and a lovely splash pad. 

We would definitely return here!","10"
"The place was great and Kostas was a great host.  Will definitely visit again!  Thank you!","10"
"The space is large, immaculate, quiet and well suited for our family of four ( with 2 teenagers).  Communication was easy and prompt since we had to arrange for a late arrival. Greg greeted us at the door and kindly helped us unload our car which was very appreciated. We were shown everything in the apartment.  Street parking was easy to find. Thank you again for a pleasant stay.","10"
"Great for someone who still wants to feel at home but be close to the downtown area. Lots of public transport to get into the heart of the city but just removed enough to still have a residential vibe. Everything you need to be at home was there. Hosts were very accommodating about check in and check out. We had a great time and no complaints!","10"
"This house is really good, we enjoyed our stay here. Easily to walk to supermarket, to bus station and subway. Its our first time to visit Montreal and we never regret our stay here. Thank you Kosta and Denis.","10"

"Notre séjour à Montréal a été inoubliable et ce logement y a largement contribué : accueil à la fois sympathique, efficace et discret, un appartement spacieux, agréable et équipé de façon très complète. Nous espérons pouvoir renouveler l'expérience un jour et gardons précieusement cette adresse.","10"
"Kosta was an amazing host: responsive, thoughtful, accomodating, and friendly. If you are considering this airbnb, please note that the pictures do not do Kosta’s place justice — the second floor entire apartment is much more spacious than the pictures let on. Thank you for allowing us to have a great weekend in Montreal, Kosta!","10"

"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour chez Kostas. Nous étions comme à la maison. Le haut de duplex sur la rue Carlton est spacieux, confortable et fonctionnel avec une grande terrasse qui surplombe le jardin. Le quartier est calme. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié la gentillesse et toutes les attentions de Kostas et de sa famille. Nous avions dans l’appartement tout ce dont nous avions besoin : une grande cuisine toute équipée, un climatiseur (il fait chaud l’été à Montréal), une excellente télévision, le Wi-Fi, une grande chambre et une terrasse où nous prenions nos repas. Tous les commerces et services sont à proximité. Le métro (station Plamondon) est à huit minutes de marche. Une excellente adresse, au calme, au cœur du quartier Côte-des-Neiges. Nous reviendrons. Merci mille fois, Kostas!   ","10"

"Marie was very accommodating of our arrival and departure.
We felt more than welcome when she pre-approved our stay which excited us even more.
The place was spotless when we arrived and it was as cozy as a house of our own (as the title suggests). 
There was heating which kept us warm in Montreal's bitter winter.
Might I add that Marie prepares you for arrival with maps and some great restaurant recommendations that were all very useful to us. 

We would definitely visit this place again because the location was close to downtown and Marie made us feel very comfortable. I would recommend this house to anyone visiting Montreal with friends or family.","10"
"My friends and I had a great time staying at Marie's home! She was very accommodating and helpful. When we could not figure out how to connect to the Wifi, I had sent her a text message and within minutes I received a response and everything was fixed. Also, the house was very cute and accurate according to the pictures. I would most definitely recommend getting in contact with Marie when looking for a place to stay in Montreal. I hope to be back again next summer.","10"

We went for the World Cup and it was an easy walk to Olympic Stadium and downtown Montreal was quickly accessible by car. Veronique was very responsive leading up to our trip and had towels, sheets and information on Montreal ready for us.

"Petit appart sympa, chat enjoué et Véronique est très accueillante","10"
"Veronique was very welcoming and nice to me. And her cat is super sweet!","10"
"Un endroit calme, dans un joli quartier plein de choses à faire ... 20 minutes en bus jusqu'à la gare de train proche du centre-ville. C'était vraiment un bon endroit pour rester. Et le chat est un excellent petit copain.
A calm place, within a nice quartier full of stuff to do...20 minutes by bus to the near train station to city center. Was a real nice place to stay. And the cat is a great little buddy","10"
"Veronique is a nice person, she tries to make the stay enjoyable and we had some nice chat sometimes. She maintains the place organized and clean, and in respect we tried to do our part also.
The cat phil (hope that is how I write the name) is nice and wants cuddles all time. 
The place has a good space, a really great balcony outside the kitchen. Also is in a street with  pharmacies, markets, bakeries, restaurants, bars, some stores, an awesome fruit/vegetable and a butcher's shop.
Although a little far it is easy to go to downtown, and as a bonus the olympic sport center is close.","10"
"Appartement bien situé, des bus permettent de nous amener vers le métro (20-30 min du centre) - à 1h à pieds du centre.
La rue est parfaite pour les restaurants, les hypermarchés ! 

Véronique est très accueillante et son chat très mignon !","10"
"Le logement est bien situé, près des transports et on peut faire ses achats à pieds. Plusieurs parc sont à proximité afin de profiter de l'été.","10"
"Veronique's place was exactly as described. Very easy to access by public transit and you find all facilities nearby. Veronique hosted my dad for almost 2 months and he loved the place. Communication was easy with Veronique and she was very helpful! We highly recommend Veronique's place for a stay in Montreal!","10"
"Véronique nous ouvre la porte de son appartement à Montréal avec beaucoup de gentillesse et de sympathie. Phil le chat est un compagnon adorable en quête de câlins. Les photos sont tout à fait conformes, l'appartement est charmant, le lit confortable, et l'endroit est calme. Le bus 47 s'arrête presque devant, et le 27 et le 67 passent non loin. Un Métro (supermarché) est à 5 minutes à pied, la promenade Masson avec commerces et restaurants à quelques minutes à pied. A 15-20 minutes à pied de l'espace pour la vie avec le jardin botanique magnifique. Prévoir un peu de temps dans les transports pour rejoindre le centre ville, mais Montréal est tellement vaste qu'on ne peut pas tout avoir. Ravie de ce séjour ! Merci Véronique.","10"
"It was really good staying!
Veronique is very kind and her reply is fast.
Her house was clean,bright and near a bus stop so it was very confortable.
There are some grocery store, farmacy, cafe and my favorite noodle restaurant(""Juste Nouilles"") around the place so it was also convinient!!","10"
"Appartement propre et calme. Hôte sympathique et disponible.","10"
"Everything was great","10"
"❤","10"
"Accueil sympathique. Le chat de Véronique est très accueillant.","10"
"Super chambre, propre, bien aménagée. Proche de certains bus donc facile de se déplacer. Véronique met à l'aise et nous laisse nous sentir comme chez nous. En plus, son chat est adorable. ","10"
"Séjour parfait, appartement conforme à la description et ressentis partagé avec les commentaires précédents ! Rien à rajouter merci Veronique.. Phil tu vas nous manquer ! Chat exceptionnel !","10"
"Veronique’s home was beautiful and cozy. Her home is not far from the botanical garden and Olympic Park which made walking easy. The ride into town was 15 minutes by car and 40 minutes by bike which made commuting easy. Overall great location and her cat Phil was so cute and cuddly.","10"
"Clean and cozy apartment in a great part of the city ! Also adorable cat to keep you company. Had a lovely experience :)","10"
"Comfy bed, on a bus route, very friendly cat! Veronique was very accommodating for my short stay.","10"
"La chambre est très bien et l'appartement est bien aménagé, on se sent comme à la maison et Phil est un bon hôte, toujours très accueillant.","10"
"Phill (the cat) is wonderful and kind !!

Apartment’s localization is good.","10"
"Veronique was great and very hospitable. Nice lady and her cat was adorable.
Great location and clean.","10"
"Véronique est une hôte très accueillante, elle me donnait pleins de conseils et d'idées pour découvrir la région.  Je me sentais comme chez moi dans le airbnb. La chambre et le lit sont confortables, son chat Phil est adorable ! J'ai passé un très bon séjour...","10"
"The apartment is very nice and comfortable! Location is very convenient, near shops and public transport. Veronique was very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend.","10"
"Great location and space for a great price! Veronique was a great host. Her cat is very cute and friendly. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back!","10"
"Veronique's place is down a lovely street, with pretty much everything you need. There's a couple of pharmacies, a few grocery stores, nd plenty of places to eat. There's a little place that does amazing pastries and coffee on the corner near where the bus is (opposite the noodle place) that I really recommend! It's right near two bus routes, both of which that take you to metros so transport is really good.
In terms of the actual house, it has everything you would need. It's not fancy, but the bed is comfy, there's plenty of storage, and the shower is nice and hot! There is only one plug location in the room so I would take a cord or something if there's two of you but aside from that, Veronique has everything you need. Phil the cat is delightful (he's so big!!!) and gives you a lovely welcome. 
Thank you!","10"
"We stayed at Veronique's home about one month and we had nice time there.
Our room was comfy and clean with enough space for our big luggage. 
There were all necessary amenities in the kitchen that you can make your own meal if you like.
There were two balconies which in winter time it is freezing out there to enjoy the fresh air but surely in summer time it would be wonderful. 
Location is perfect, near several of restaurants, pharmacies, grocery stores and shops which helps you to eat or buy what you want. it is close enough to bus stops that take you to metro stations.
If you like to talk you can have nice chat with Veronique and if you want to have your own privacy she is really respectful.
Last but not least, we enjoyed playing with Mr. Phil during our stay as he is so cute and friendly.","10"
"Très bien","10"
"It was my first day in Canada and my first Airbnb with a host. Veronique was friendly and super kind, and her cat as well;) She suggested me to wear her winter sport pants if i wanted due to the amazing temperature of Canada. For four days in her place, i had felt such a warm atmosphere and i enjoyed a lot in Montreal due to that. The room was same with photo and it had shower amenities and a hair dryer as well. Everything was fine.","10"
"We spend there around 10 days and we felt very comfortable. The kitchen is fully equipped and we could cook and prepare our meals in the cold winter of Montreal. The room was very nice and the bed super comfortable. Sometimes it was difficult to wake up in the mornings
 Véronique work during the day but her lovely cat Phil was the guardian of the house all day. He loves to be cuddled. You should like cats if you want to spend time at the apparent.","10"
"una estancia muy cómoda, excelente ubicacion para todo lo que quieras hacer","10"
"We didn't get to meet Nico, but his roommates were very nice! It was easy to pick up the keys, and when leaving we just left the key in the house on our way out. The place was clean, and the bed was awesome! We got to control the heat in our own room which was really nice, since it was freezing outside! We ended up taking a lot of Uber rides, but we did take the Metro once, and it was convenient to get to. About a 5 minutes walk. ","10"
"Thank you so much Nicolas. You are such a great host. Your place was well located, super super super clean and the bed was incredible.

I recommand this place for sure !","10"
"Nico and his house mates were very hospitable! The room was great and very clean. The house was in a prefect location. All round great experience!","10"
"Well, I didn't meet Nico, but his roommate Moran was very kind, nice and handsome! lol The room and bed was clean. well located. and there is a free bike rental shop near the station which is just 7min walk from this place.","10"
"Stayed here in my first few days of moving to Montreal. The apartment was very well located and the room was perfectly clean; the bed was extremely comfortable and just what I needed to nurse jet lag. Nico's housemate, Morgan was around to answer my questions and was helpful. Morgan's mom who was visiting, was also sweet, and so very pleasant to be around. 

I didn't meet Nico until I returned two weeks later to pick up my two large suitcases, which Nico and his housemates have kindly allowed me to store in the apartment. While I needed only the basics: good sleep, hot water for coffee, hot shower, central location -- from my quick chat with Nico, I get the sense that he's the kind of host I would like to have when in a new city. He genuinely cared about his guests, and had time in his day to have a quick chat. ","10"
"highly recommend it, great location and great host","10"
"Nico's place was perfect for my brief stay in Montreal! His roommate was helpful, and the apartment is in the middle of a neighborhood with many cool shops, places to eat, and nightlife destinations.","10"
"Great host and extremely attentive and quick to respond to any questions and concerns. Great location as well!","10"
"Nico's place is perfect for a Montreal getaway. The bed is REALLY comfortable. Very clean place and perfectly located right close to restaurants, bars and lots of places. The good thing is that it is close but not so close to bother at night when trying to sleep. Nico was an excellent host and provided us with all we needed. He received us even when we arrived late at night and gave us a tour of the house. Highly recommended.","10"
"Good place if you are looking for stay night time at Montreal. Good location. Close to most of restaurant and mont royal. Transportation for bus or subway is pretty close","10"
"Très bon hôte, très gentil et serviable, très bon emplacement et surtout très propre, très bon séjour, je recommande fortement!","10"
"the apartment is very cute and in a great location in the plateau. The hosts were very easy to deal with and were readily available. the place was pretty clean, however there was only one roll of TP and the lid on the toilet was broken. But otherwise it was great. I recommend it.","9"
"The team was very welcoming. It was easy to get there and find the place, and it was exactly as described! I really enjoyed my stay. ","9"
"The apartment looked exactly as pictured. The furniture is new and the apartment was very clean. It was a bit stuffy, but when I asked Flatbook, they brought over a fan. There is a TV, but no cable service (you can hook up a laptop and use your own streaming service). My only complaint about the Flatbook was that communicating with them was a bit strange and different from my other experiences with airbnb (I've always reserved with private homeowners). Though they were certainly responsive, the responses always came from a different employee and there seemed to be uneven communication between them, so I had to repeat my question/request and the backstory each time. ","9"
"This was our first time staying at Flatbook. We found the team to be very efficient, considerate and professional.  We were a bit late in arriving due to traffic but were still met at the door by smiling faces and a chocolate cake (to celebrate our wedding anniversary).   We very much appreciated the thoughtful gesture.

We were escorted to the flat and were pleased by the cleanliness and functionality of the space.  It was exactly what we had hoped for as well as being centrally located, near transit (metro), shops and restaurants.  It suited our purposes wonderfully.  We were also very pleasantly surprised to find the use of laundry facilities, including soap, had been included in the rental.

The only negative comments concern 1) the fact that this building has a lot of stairs to contend with.  So anyone with mobility issues would need to take this into consideration.  And 2) the television is not hooked up to any local channel.  Whenever we travel, my wife and I usually like to listen to local news and weather.  We managed to get some local information via WIFI by connecting the HDMI cable they provide to our laptop.  Flatbook may wish to add a section to their information kit listing local television/radio stations.

Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely recommend this to friends and family.","9"
"no complaints! everything ran smoothly with check in and check out. excellent location, everything was as described ","9"
"The listing description was accurate! The area was great, a ton of options for restaurants and shopping and right near the metro! 

Great host !  ","9"
"Wonderful location, excellent room stocked with essentials and more","9"
"logement très bien équipé , tout correspondait aux photos et descriptifs de l'annonce ...

Quartier animé et très bien situé ...","9"
"The apartment looks exactly as pictured and is perfect for a short-term stay in the Plateau. Very clean and stocked with just about everything.","9"
"Great spot, close to Parc Mont Royal and lots of great small shops and places to eat; an easy walk to the subway. The apartment is clean and has all that you need. The pull out sofa is not very comfortable, so I would not recommend this apartment for four adults. It was fine for a family with young kids - i.e. us. It would be great for a couple. Overall we really enjoyed our stay, and even though there was a mix up with bedding, they were responsive and did their best to sort it out quickly. ","9"
"Perfectly adequate place to stay in every possible way. The apartment is quite barebones and in need of repairs but on par with Plateau apartments in general. I was quite happy with the value-for-money.","9"
"Overall, we had a good stay. The location is great and the neighborhood is charming.  The apartment gets a lot of sun however, which woke us up too early.  I've suggested that better blinds be put up.  But the other aspects of the apartment were good. Quiet, clean and pleasant.","9"
"Booked this place at the last minute and almost everything was great. As mentioned before something should be done for the blinds. Otherwise the place was super clean. We had everything we needed in the kitchen and the bathroom. Very easy to communicate with them and very responsive. It was specially hot days when we stayed in Montreal and the A/C being a bit noisy we asked if they could provide us with a fan and they actually brought two on the same day. That was very much appreciated! I would definitely stay in other flats managed by Sonder.","9"
"The place was bright, beautiful and clean and included everything as advertised. The only problem was that power was out in whole unit except for the kitchen so we didn't have air conditioning for the first night. After contacting them and waiting half a day for a reply, we were finally able to get power back by switching the breaker back on. Other than that, perfect place to stay for a few days.","9"
"Joanna was amazing, she responded immediately and the apartment we stayed at was beautiful. The apartment is located in a very nice area and we really appreciated the guide book Joanna left for us as well! Joanna was great and we would book a place through her again in a heartbeat!","9"
"Frederique is by far the nicest most decent and hospitable person i've dealt with since I can remember. There are no surprises when you rent from these awesome people, you get what you were promised if not more. The flat was super clean, with a comfortable bed and top notch washing machine, dryer and kitchen equipment. The area is friendly and quiet with nice neighbours.
Frederique responded to my questions instantly, and cooperated regarding any special requests I had.
Those people care about Montreal and their guests passionately, so you will also get a guest book with all the info you need about the area you're staying in as well as the best things to do in Montreal. 
Dealing with people of this standard and kindness is heart warming. I'm glad you guys exist. ","9"
"My stay with Robert at the apartment hosted by Joanna and Frederique was simply amazing. It had all the amenities we needed to make our trip even more enjoyable. We utilized the kitchen often to cook our meals and enjoyed them on the balcony along with the nice weather and serenity of the neighborhood. The wifi was a little slow during the first few days but manageable. Frederique was a wonderful host and consistently checked up with us, responding very quickly to any questions or regards. There is a very useful packet that came with the place, which provided information on the apartment and many recommendations for anything you could possibly think of--food, shopping, entertainment, etc. The metro was very close to the apartment and the location allowed us to travel very easily to the downtown area of Montreal. Overall, the experience was very satisfying and I certainly recommend anyone traveling to Montreal to stay at this spot! Thanks again, Frederique!","9"
"Bonjour,
L'appartement que nous avons loué rue de verdun est fidèle aux photos publiées sur Airbnb. Il est sympa et bien équipé au niveau des électros et des autre équipements. Il est situé pas trop loin du étro.
 Nous avons une réserve quant à la qualité du matelas trop dur et à l' (Website hidden by Airbnb) la chambre qui est située coté route on entend bien tous les bruits de circulation, c'est bien dommage mais compte tenu de la configuration de l'appartement, il ne peut être situé que coté route, si la chambre avait pu être situé du coté intérieur, ça aurait été génial. 
Prévoir peut être un meilleure insonorisation mais apparemment c'est une réserve que j'émets pour pas mal d'appartements à Montréal à l'exception des appartements modernes
Sinon à part ces réserves, je vous le recommande","9"
"Bel appartement, idéalement situé près d'une station de métro, parking facile.
Nous n'avons malheureusement pas rencontré Joanna mais très bon contact et disponibilité par écrit et toutes les info pratiques du quartier et des conseils pour la visite de la ville étaient dispo à notre arrivée.
","9"
"The apartment was very clean upon arrival. And     the way it does in pictures. The hosts were very  helpful and i called them several times to ask questions about a few things and they were nice and very kind. The guest book provided is very handy and i used it during our stay.

The washer dryer are super
The kitchen is very clean and well equipped 
The bathroom is very decent 
The bed size is ok i personally would prefer a bigger bed
The tv Internet and Ac are all excellent addition 
The only issue i had were the stairs to the building and then up to the apartment. I have a knee injury so you can imagine.

Over all this place is so worth it and its close to literally Everything. You just have to walk maximum 10 minutes to be near anything from metros...restaurants. markets...pharmacies...grocery shops...etc...
I highly recommend this apartment if you wanna have a good time in montreal !","9"
"I had three amazing weeks at Jad's. It was an absolutely pleasant experience. His place is super clean, organised and comfortable with all the comfort you can imagine.
Great location, close to the metro and train station. 
He's a generous host with friendly attitude, always ready to help.
Highly recommended! Would love to go back to visit.","10"
"L'expérience dans l'appartement de Jad a été tout à fait extraordinaire. Très luxueux complet, localisé au centre-ville près de tout, je le recommande pour ceux qui aiment le milieu urbain dans un appartement hôtel","10"
"True to description - perfect ""hotel like"" experience. Spent a weekend at Jad's with my girlfriend in what is essentially a hotel room suite. The room was well equipped with everything we needed and most importantly it was very clean. We also made use of the heated pool which was great. 

Location wise it's perfect. Connected to the Metro and underground walking path. Also it is easy enough to walk to the Old Port and some of the other points of interest in the city center.","10"
"Jad was honestly the BEST host you can ever imagine, he was there at the door with a croissant (like actually). I couldn't have found a better host, suite, or location. The building was 5 minutes from the bus station and within 10 minutes of walking distance from everything! The room is exactly as in the description with some extra fun things Jad has put in the room (we got a lava lamp and a foot massage, haha). It was my first time using Airbnb and honestly, Jad and this location have set the standard. It was perfect. ","10"
"My boyfriend and I had a great time at Jad's place. The building has all the amenities you could ask for and is in walking distance to everything. Jad was quick to respond to any questions we had and went out of his way to provide us with some of his favorite snacks. Would definitely stay at his place again in the future.","10"
"Jad was an awesome host. He met up with me even though my train arrived late and it was really easy to get in touch with him! He had all the necessities at his place in the event that you forgot something.  

The location is fantastic (right beside the via station). The view is great.

This experience was above my expectations. I would definitely recommend him for anyone staying in Montreal. ","10"
"Jad was a great host and his apartment is fantastic! We loved the foot massager haha. Jad gave us a nice tour when we checked in and was very helpful all around.","10"
"Jad's place was amazing! Great view, and so close to everything. We had a blast!
Jad met up with us to give us a quick tour of all that his space has to offer... Which is a lot! He was very helpful and answered all our questions. Would definitely recommend his place. Thanks again, Jad!!! We'll be back! :)","10"
"Jad is a fantastic host! He was very welcoming, showed us around the building and a brief tour of Montreal. I do not live far from Montreal so I was already very familiar with the streets. The apartment was SO clean and it had everything we needed. The view was amazing as well, the windows were facing the view of Downtown Montreal and was even better when lit up at night. HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone!! Although, it is a shared kitchen, as it is a residence but that did not bother me at all. Oh, and, the king sized bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever been on.  All in all, I would recommend Jad's place to anyone!","10"
"Jad a tout organisé et est un hote trés sympa , nous avons profité de la salle de sport , de la piscine et même pour laver le linge ! Le lit est trés confortable . La situation est excellente pour visiter Montreal .

"J ai aime mon séjour très propre avec très vu. Ce un endroit que j vous conseille très sécuritaire. Merci","10"
"Jad went above and beyond to make my experience exceptional.

The location of the unit is perfect for walking and exploring Old Montreal.

Jad is first class!","10"
"The place was great and the description was very accurate. It was right in the middle of downtown, near trains and shopping areas. And Jad did a great job on checking in with me to see if everything was okay. Thanks Jad!","10"
"Jad's room was really lovely and exactly as pictured. It is centrally located. I short walk to the University and to the old city and shopping and great restaurants. The building has excellent services - gym, pool, library/business centre and the staff are most friendly. We very much enjoyed our stay.","10"
"Great location

"Everything went smoothly. Great location, just a few minutes walk from downtown and old Montreal. Such a great weekend. Jad was very communicative and always replied promptly.  Will stay again. ","10"

"Notre passage à Luxurious Hôtel Experience, nous fûmes des plus agréables, cet hôtel vous propose de très belles prestations qui vous permettent dès votre arrivée à ce que votre séjour puisse être dès plus appréciable… Jad dispose d’une très belle chambre avec tout le confort que vous pouvez souhaiter avec une vue imprenable sur Montréal ….Merci Jad pour ce séjour bien agréable","10"
"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Unfortunately we didn't get to meet the host personally but everything went extremely well. We received two room cards and one laundry card, and have access to all the facilities including the communal kitchen. The room was fantastic and high-class, and the host was very considerate -- we have everything in the room that we can possibly think of! Great location and neighbourhood, close to McGill University and shopping centres. The only con is residents need to beware of potential drunk students in the building and keep your door closed at all times. Overall wonderful experience. Thank you so much Jad!","10"
"Bien meuble, confortable, pour être au centre ville ou encore à proximité du vieux Montreal emplacement idéal.","10"

"We couldn't be more grateful to Geneviève and Yanick. The apartment was more beautiful than the pictures led on and these hosts were even more kind and easy to work than we could have hoped for. Total sweethearts...thanks again for everything!","10"
"We had an amazing stay at this home! It is so much bigger and lovelier than the pictures even convey. The neighborhood is fantastic too.  It's a bit north of the trendy neighborhoods of Mile End and Plateau, but we were so happy we ended up staying here.  It has tree-lined streets with a wonderful village feel.  It also seems to be a destination restaurant neighborhood and we ate really well. I highly recommend both Jean Talon market and the Indonesian tapas bar.  The home itself is airy and spacious with a wonderful back deck. It's particularly good for families.  Coming back after a day out biking and exploring felt like coming home - only much nicer.  Genevieve and Yanick were out of town when we were there but communication was quick and easy and there neighbor Dan was enormously helpful in letting us in and providing advice.  Would definitely stay again if possible.","10"
"We spent an wonderful week in Geneviève & Yanick's charming home, with its lovely back garden terrace. The apartment is very large and well organised for family life (we were 2 parents with three teens), and possessed all necessary amenities for visitors. The beds are comfortable, the two bathrooms are recently renovated, the kitchen is great to cook in, everything was clean and organised for our arrival, no problems with the wifi or tv.  And the cat is friendly.  Our questions were quickly answered.
The neighbourhood is fantastic, very family-oriented, close to 2 métro lines, several bus lines, a fantastic bakery, Jean-Talon market, great restos, Dumoulin bike shop, Bixi bikes....you can walk everywhere you need to go!
We highly reccommend this home to family travellers.","10"
"Le séjour s'est très bien placé! La maison de Geneviève et Yanick est très bien placée, dans un quartier très sympa. Elle est par ailleurs très très agréable à vivre. Tout était prêt pour qu'on passe un bon week-end! Je recommande vivement!","10"
"We had a great stay at Genevieve and Yanick’s home. The community was beautiful and the home was was more than we expected!","10"
"Je me suis tout de suite sentie chez moi! Félix est une hôte formidable! Je me suis sentie comme une amie en visite. La chambre était belle, propre et confortable et j'ai très bien dormi. Les chats adorables, et la déco vraiment magnifique! Le quartier est parmi les plus beaux de Montréal... J'ai trouvé tout ce que je cherchais, et ce, à pied! J'ai beaucoup aimé mon expérience et je relouerais cette chambre n'importe quand!","10"
"Séjour très agréable, la chambre mise à ma disposition était en tout point conforme à sa description: confortable, bien aménagée et fonctionnelle. L'appartement en lui même est aussi très sympa et très bien situé aux portes de la petite Italie. Enfin, mention spéciale pour les hôtes particulièrement sympathiques, dynamiques et impliqués qui m'ont notamment permis de découvrir un délicieux restaurant vietnamien!!!","10"
"Félix has a lovely place minutes walk from Jean Talon market and great restaurants, cafes and shops. 

The room itself was clean and cosy and, though we didn't see too much of Félix and her boyfriend, they were very friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. ","10"
"This is a cosy warm place to stay in with the most welcoming people you'll meet. Made my stay in Montreal a great experience.","10"
"Nous avons beaucoup apprécié le côté chaleureux et funny de Félix et son compagnon. En rentrant chez eux, nous nous sommes retrouvés dans un univers atypique et tout en couleurs: la déco est originale et vintage. C'est un véritable cabinet de curiosité! 
Vous serez certainement accueillis par Choucroute et Moussaka qui sont les stars de la maison ;-) ","10"
"My stay with Felix was a disappointment. I booked with her because her and her boyfriend appeared to be friendly and provide a comfy living space, but my experience was to the contrary. Felix's communication skills as a host were not where I believe they should be. I didn't receive any messages until I contacted her, wasn't informed that she would be away from the apartment until a few hours before my arrival,  and received poor instructions regarding the location of the spare key (which lead to a drawn out process entering the apartment upon arrival).  When I later asked for her recommendations on places to visit in the city, she made no attempt to offer suggestions, instead directing me to look at a guidebook. 

The apartment was lacking in terms of comfort and cleanliness. The room itself was fine, but the mattress was very hard. The room is adjacent to the kitchen where most of the social activity happens. Additionally, the walls are thin, which meant that I could clearly hear the neighbor's crying infant baby  at various points during my stay. The kitchen sink was stacked high with dirty dishes during most of my stay and  clothes were placed on the bathroom floor for extended periods of time. The hosts are cigarette smokers and the smell (which i am sensitive to) entered into the kitchen and my bedroom. 

Overall, I felt unwelcome in Felix and her boyfriend's home. I booked on short notice, but if my stay was too much of a burden, I would have preferred that she not accept my request, as there were several other great options in the area. 

On the positive side, the apartment has interesting vintage decor throughout and is well situated in the city. The cats are really sweet. 
","10"
"J'ai passé chez Félix un séjour inoubliable ! Felix et son conjoint sont des personnes exceptionnelles qui ont su être à l'écoute de mes demandes. La communication a vraiment été trés bonne, dés la reservation faite ;) Ils m'ont donné les meilleurs conseils pour bien profiter du quartier et de la ville.

Du côté de la chambre, si vous cherchez quelque chose de calme, avec une décoration originale, vous ne pouvez pas mieux tomber. C'est un véritable cabinet de curiosité, l'appartement est plein d'objets vintage !

Il faut savoir que l'appart est à quelques minutes du métro et de tous les bus dont vous aurez besoin. Le quartier regorge de restaurants et de bars, et il y'a une vraie ambiance de quartier !

La propreté, l'acceuil, le côté chaleureux et original de la chambre … Pour moi c'est un 100%, je recommande chaudement à tout le monde Félix et son petit havre de paix ;)
","10"
"Notre séjour chez Félix et Yvan fut encore une belle expérience! Nous savions qu'en y retournant nous ne serions pas déçus. Félix est toujours autant de bon conseil.
Beaubien reste le quartier que nous préférons! C'est vraiment proche de tout. Bref un bon point de chute à Montréal!","10"
"Our stay with Félix was fabulous. She was easy to communicate with, check in was a breeze, we were greeted by an open door and extremely welcoming flat! Her and her boyfriend were as nice as can be and I would absolutely stay here again! I can't recommend them enough!","10"
"I had an excellent stay at Félix's lovely apartment! Félix and her boyfriend Yvan were extremely kind and welcoming hosts. Félix was quick to respond to my last-minute request and made my arrival very easy.  

The room was very comfortable, and I felt right at home. Félix's apartment is filled with plants and cool vintage knick knacks. The location is perfect - a charming block in Little Italy near many great bars, cafes, parks, restaurants, and easy walking distance to Mile End and Jean Talon Market. I enjoyed spending hours strolling around the neighborhood during my visit, and found it easy to get downtown and to other parts of Montreal via the nearby metro. It was great to come home after a long day of exploring the city to a glass of wine with Félix and Yvan on their balcony. I had the best time staying here in Montreal!","10"
"Lovely home and hosts. Quintessential Montreal artist home, welcoming with very comfortable bed and excellent location. Our first choice in the city.","10"
"Felix and Ivan are lovely hosts who were very friendly and helpful. Their place is spacious and clean and artsy. You get the privacy you want if you want it but two lovely friends are always available to give you suggestions about where to visit and things to do. Location is in Little Italy, a really nice area with lots of cute restaurants and bars nearby. I really enjoyed staying there and would definitely recommend it to others! ","10"
"The hosts made my guest and I feel very much at home. Both Felix and Ivan were helpful at making recomendations and urged us to contact them with any problem or concerns.Their artfully decor added a comforting aspect to our stay. The location is conveniently located minutes away from a metro station which made it easy for us to travel. Best part of all were the cats, Choupette and Moussaka :)","10"
"Everything about the trip was perfect! Felix and Ivan were very helpful and answered all of the questions I asked.  Even if you do not know anything about the city, the hosts will guide you in the right direction.  Their place has a warm and artistic feel to it which is very inviting.  The location is fantastic as it is in a ""quiet"" part of town, but still has many restaurants and bars nearby.  Even if you do not know anything about the city, the hosts will guide you in the right direction.  Felix and Ivan made my first Airbnb experience a fantastic one and I am sure others will also be impressed.  ","10"
"Félix and Ivan were amazing hosts, very helpful and friendly and not only did they make me feel completely at home, the room was light, comfortable and very clean and their two cats were very lovable and friendly.  The bed was incredibly comfortable especially the super soft sheets! 
They had an amazing coffee machine, and everything in the apartment was perfectly clean.
They are located in a vibrant and young  residential area that a good variety of restaurants and stores. 
I had a great time staying here and getting to know Félix and Ivan (to the extent that I have stayed twice!), and would strongly recommend theirs as the apartment you should stay in in Montreal! ","10"
"A+++ Felix & Yvan are amazing! Their place is beautiful, clean and full of character. The house is in a lovely neighborhood, cafes and restaurants are an easy walk, as is Mount Royal. I would highly recommend staying here!","10"
"This place is great and location is perfect. Very close to the metro, local merchants and Jean Talon market. Hosts are very kind. I strongly recommend this place. ","10"
"Accueil très sympathique par Felix et Yvan, nous avons apprécié notre chambre et aussi de pouvoir profiter de toutes les commodités de l'appartement.Très bon point de chute dans un quartier typique de Montréal. A conseiller.","10"
"Magnifique appartement où il fait bon vivre et où on se sent comme chez sois grâce à Félix et Yvan qui sont deux hôtes adorables.","10"
"Such a charming place, it had a very laid back, relax vibe.  Felix was a great host, and even though the location changed, it was still in a great spot.  I would definitely recommend!","10"
"I had a terrific stay. Felix and her partner were wonderfully welcoming hosts. The room was spacious and the desk was a nice bonus since I was coming into town on a work trip. The apartment is only a few minutes away from the nearest Metro stop, making it really easy to get around. There were also a ton of neat restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores in the area.","10"
"On n'aurait pas pu rêver mieux que ces derniers jours chez Félix et Ivan. Chaleur, amitié, simplicité et intensité des échanges, quel superlatif trouver ? Et en plus, pour les chanceux comme nous, vous aurez la chance de dormir avec Maria Carey. Bref, chez Félix  & Ivan, un must de la good vibe montréalaise !!","10"
"Je suis très heureux de mon séjour chez Félix et Ivan. Leur logement est très bien placé, l'accueil y est très chaleureux et leurs conseils avisés m'ont permis de trouver des solutions à toutes mes questions :)

L'annonce est totalement conforme au logement, la chambre et le lit sont très confortables et le logement est à quelques pas du métro.

J'espère avoir l'opportunité de vous recroiser dans le cadre d'un futur voyage. 

À réserver les yeux fermés si vous souhaitez vivre une jolie expérience Montréalaise !","10"
"Great location on quiet street in nice neighborhood.  Two block walk to subway and busses.  Necessary amenities close by.  Felix & Ivan were very hospitable and accommodating.  Speaking of accommodating, they speak English - this is Montreal where many people to not speak English.  (Perhaps I should learn a little French!)","10"
"Really awesome stay! Located in a lovely quiet neighborhood with access to metro and small restaurants. One of the cats is especially friendly and loves attention :) Sweet hosts too! Would highly recommend!","10"
"Un intérieur magnifique, plein de charme et de bonne humeur, à 5 minutes du métro et situé dans un quartier de Montréal à la fois paisible et bon-vivant.
Des hôtes toujours attentifs et souriants qui mettent tout de suite en confiance et justifient à eux seuls l'expérience. Sans oublier deux chats adorables. Top.
A bientôt j'espère!","10"
"Je recommande le logement de Felix et de son conjoint. Ils y ont accueilli mon papa qui me rendait visite à Montreal et ce dernier a vraiment apprécié son sejour chez eux. Le metro est a quelques minutes a pied et l'appartement est situé dans un tres chouette quartier. Bonne continuation","10"
"Super séjour chez Félix, la chambre est parfaite et très mignonne, super quartier, facile d'accès et vraiment à 2 pas de bons restos et bars! Accueil très chaleureux, et ils restent dispos si jamais j'avais une question. En tout très agréable, merci encore pour un super weekend!","10"

"L'appartement de Geneviève est très agréable, bien situé, équipé et paisible. Nous n'avons pas pu rencontrer Geneviève, mais son ami Léonardo, très sympathique, a su avec beaucoup d'attention répondre à nos attentes et faire en sorte que notre séjour se déroule au mieux. 
","10"
"Excellent experience with no complaints.  Genevieve is a lovely host - she was constantly in contact with helpful information and checking in to ensure no issues.  Logistics were easy, and Genevieve herself was very helpful and friendly (plus fluently bilingual).  The apartment is very conveniently located, easy walk to the metro as well as lots of great spots in Mile End.  It was very clean, and an excellent value.","10"
"Bonjour
Le logement correspond tres bien a la description sur le site. Très propre,  ambiance chaleureuse et calme. A proximité des grands artères,  pres des stations de metro et des espaces vert. Idéale pour profiter de la grande ville! Je le recommande a tous! 
Geneviève est tres accueillante et discrète.","10"
"Fantastic spot in a great neighborhood. Clean, comfortable, and Genevieve created a welcoming experience. Walkable, bike rental nearby, metro close as well. Chez Claudette! Super charming!","10"
"The apartment is indeed charming, very well located and well equipped. All of us had a great time spending time in the house in the different nooks and admiring the decor and walking around the neighborhood. Our dog loved the Laurier park and we enjoyed that we could walk to most places in the city or hop on the nearby metro when we got tired. It was a pleasure meeting Marius and visiting your bar too!","10"
"Great communication from Mina ahead of our arrival, making sure we had everything we needed. Everything was all set for us when we arrived. Apartment is very warm and welcoming; nicely laid out and very home-y feeling. Bedrooms and living room are very comfortable and the kitchen is well equipped.

The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. No real noise at night (we slept with the windows open). Great cafes, restaurants, parks, and groceries within a 5 minute walking distance. Subway is an easy 10-15 minute walk with easy access into downtown. 

All in all this is a great apartment in a great location and the hosts are very welcoming. Highly recommended!","10"
"We have really enjoyed staying in this appartment, clean and very functional. Great location on the ""plateau"". We would definitly consider this appartment for our next visit to Montreal.","10"
"Mina kept great communication before, during, and after our trip.  Check in was easy and the apartment is very nicely decorated with everything you would need during your stay. Beautiful and quiet neighborhood with a Starbucks and supermarket on the corner which was very useful. Plus a bunch of great bistros, breakfast nooks, and restaurants steps away. You can't beat it. I would highly recommend this flat to anyone visiting Montreal.  Thanks for hosting us. We hope to return soon from NYC. ","10"
"Excellent séjour à Montreal dans l'appartement de Mina, très fonctionnel et magnifique, conformément à sa description. On a pu faire également des machines, ce qui était très utile. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Mina car elle était en vacances, mais tout était prévu. Le quartier du Plateau est formidable. A recommander . ","10"
"Renting this apartment was great- Mina was quick to respond, correspondence was fluid and the apartment is in a wonderful location- great amenities, great neighbourhood atmosphere and close to a subway station. The apartment has everything you could need- a well stocked and appointed kitchen, wi-fi and air conditioning in a Montreal heatwave!","10"
"Quel magnifique appartement dans un si beau quartier ! On s'est vraiment senti comme à la maison! Mina a été au petit soin, bien que loin du Québec, et très arrangeante pour nos petits changements de dernière minute. Un grand merci à elle! On espère revenir très vite !","10"
"Though the host was not present when we arrived, she made sure all the details were taken care of to make us feel very welcome.  The neighbor hood was pleasant and close to all necessities. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend Mina's home to others. ","10"
"Mina's apartment was a perfect place to stay! Very spacious and even though there were 6 of us, we didn't feel crowded at any time. There was even room to put an extra air bed in the living room. Grocery and SAQ are right around the corner, as well as some of the best ice cream in Montreal! (Bo-Bec). It was nice to relax in Laurier Park after having brunch at nearby Le Toasteur Laurier. Don't forget to walk over to St Denis or St Laurent or down to Mont Royal to check out the shops and restaurants!

As for the apartment itself, it was very clean, the beds were comfy, there were plenty of linens, the shower was amazing, the kitchen was GORGEOUS, and it was handy having the toilet in a separate room from the shower. Both the living room and main bedroom have ample air conditioning - it was quite warm in other parts, but that is expected in a heatwave, I suppose.  Although we did not get to meet Mina, she was available over text and answered the few questions we had, as well as offered her son's contact info (although everything was so organized and straight forward that we didn't need any help!) One thing of note is that the steps are very steep getting in and out of the apartment - possibly not suitable for older people.

I hope to stay here again when I return to Montreal next year. It was nice getting to know a different part of the plateau. Thanks Mina for everything!","10"
"We never met our host but communication was excellent and we were very pleased with the accommodation. The location was awesome, great neighbourhood and if visiting in summer there is an outdoor pool nearby that's great to hang out with friends and family! 
The apartment is super spacious in a typical Montreal style home with ample facilities to cook, relax and freshen up. 
That's so much for a great stay!!","10"
"Mina's apartment was wonderful. It was very clean and the posted pictures are accurate. Communication with Mina before, during and after our stay was great. The location of the apartment was perfect, it was close to transit to get to major attractions, but it was very awesome to stay in a less touristy area to be submerged in the local culture. The neighborhood is wonderful with plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. We did not rent a car while we were there and had no issues getting around. I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Montreal. ","10"
"I had a month-long stay at Maureen's in June/July 2010. She made sure I had directions to get in well, took me to the grocery store to make sure I knew where it was, and was generally a friendly, happy host. One thing not mentioned in the listing is that this is a triplex - Maureen lives on the first floor, I stayed in one of the four bedrooms on the third floor, and she was remodeling the second floor to create four more bedrooms. Guests have great privacy if they want it.

I have to mention that there were ants in the kitchen - Maureen knows and is working to eradicate them, but anyone who's really bothered by bugs might be put off.

I had a great time here. The place was just as described, the neighborhood was calm and safe, and Montreal was lovely. Thanks for having me.","9"
"I stayed with Maureen for a week at the end of July 2011 and couldn't have had a more pleasant time. Maureen was a gracious host who went above and beyond to ensure that I had a wonderful stay. Thanks for all you did to welcome me to the beautiful city of Montreal! :)","9"
"If you are looking for a serene and peaceful place devoid of city noise and commotion,then Maureen place is the best place.If you want to do reseach,and avoid the prying eyes,then Maureen place is the best for.It is not like the conventional hotel,where you can be disturb by the house keeper,you have everything to your self.I would always choose Maureen place anytime I come to Montreal.","9"
"Excellent.  Would highly recommend it.","9"
"I stayed at Maureen's for one week. The area is really quiet compared to the center of town. Nice place to have a rest after a long day of walking. Maureen was really nice to me, she even drove me to the supermarket as I arrived late and had nothing to eat. I recommend this place and this host.","9"
"It was an excelent place to stay, very clean, quiet, confortable and spacious. Its's very near to subway and just one hour walking downtown. 
Maureen is a very nice hostess, she's always available if you need something. I really recomend this place. I spent 25 nights there and I didn't have any problem.

","9"
"I had a great stay at Charming MtlHomestay Accomodation. Maureen was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. A quiet, calm and relaxed atmosphere and interesting neighborhood, with Rue Sherbrooke close by. ","9"
"I really dislike reviews, and hate being badgered to write one. My stay was fine and had no problems, got what I paid for and moved on. ","9"
"Maureen was a very friendly host and was there to meet me upon arrival. The room itself, bathroom and common area (there were 4 bedrooms in all) were all very clean and quite pleasant, if somewhat plain. The kitchen (which I did not need to use) could have used a bit of cleaning. 
The neighborhood is nice; very quiet and close to buses, the metro and great strips of activity on Sherbrooke (5 min. walk) and Monkland (15 min. walk). Available street parking is a nice bonus for those that are driving.
If you're looking for a clean, quiet and simple place to sleep that's relatively near to downtown, this is a good spot. Perhaps not for those that have more of a chic B+B environment in mind.","9"
"Our stay was fine. Guests should know it's very basic: bring your own soap, paper towels, and extra toilet paper. If you plan to use the kitchen, bring a sharp knife, a fresh sponge, and some pots with handles.","9"
"Maureen was a very nice host. On the first day of my arrival she even took me grocery shopping and pointed out where I can do my shopping. The place overall is nice and the bed is big.
The shared kitchen is big however counter space limited. The knife is a bit dull as well but overall it was fine - there are pots, pans, plates, utensils and even wine glasses at your disposal.","9"
"Maureen is a wonderful host! I stayed in her apartment for 2 months and had a great time! 
The apartment truly exceeded my expectations: spacious room, fully equipped kitchen and bathroom in a quite, safe and very centrally located area in Montreal. 
Maureen was always friendly and kind and I enjoyed our occasional little chats on her doorway. 
She was always reachable and whenever there was a problem, she immediately took care of it.

Definitely my best Airbnb experience so far! I can only recommend staying with Maureen!","9"
"Staying at Maureen's was wonderful.","9"
"This is an entirely separate penthouse 3 bedroom. We had 4 guys stay here for a long weekend and were very comfortable. The back balcony is great for hanging out and it's very quiet at night for sleeping.","9"
"Thanks for a very comfortable stay. Parking was very easy & everything was what we expected. I liked how all windows slightly opened gave such a nice, cool & fresh air thru the entire home day & night.
We would love to stay at your place again next time we visit Montreal.

"Was very accommodating, she met us late at night. We were late. No problems with anything . Very clean and nicely decorated. Washer and drier was handy as well as great balcony and location ","9"
"Ichraf was very friendly and welcoming.  The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures.  It was comfortable and we really loved the balcony and BBQ.  Our only concern was that the parking was on the street.  We really appreciated the small things Ichraf thought of like milk and cereal, coffee, spices, etc.  ","9"
"Ichraf is a wonderful host. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities you could need. It's a perfect sample of Montreal living in a great part of town with easy access to food and transit.
Couldn't recommend it it more. Great value. Great place.","9"
"[Le français ci-dessous]

Ichraf's apartment is very comfortable and well-maintained. It has two good-sized bedrooms in addition to a long common space, so it was a good place for our family with two young children. She was able to accommodate our late arrival, and even came to check everything was OK once she heard that I'd arrived. She was very friendly, and (in contrast to some other Montreal hosts) quickly responded to messages. We had a very good experience. One thing to note -- parking is street parking as opposed to located on the property.

---

L'appartement d'Ichraf est très confortable et en bonne forme. Il y a deux chambres d'une bonne taille ainsi qu'une espace partagée assez longue, donc c'était un bon choix pour ma famille et moi avec nos deux jeunes enfants.  Elle était capable d'accommoder notre arrivée tardive, et elle est même venue me voir pour vérifier que tout allait bien dès qu'elle a entendu que j'étais arrivé. Elle était très gentille, et (contrairement à plusieurs hôtes à Montréal) elle a répondu vite aux messages. Notre expérience était très bonne. Une chose a constater -- le stationnement est dans la rue, plutôt que sur la propriété.","9"
"Great welcome by Ichraf who greeted us on our more than late arrival. The location although not central is about 10 yards from a Bixi (Montreal bicycle rental) station. We bicycled back from downtown Montreal to the apartment and felt very safe. Overall, a great experience. ","9"
"Ichraf nous a très bien accueillis ! Elle est restée disponible durant notre séjour pour répondre à nos questions. Ce fut un très beau début de séjour en Amérique pour toute la famille.","9"

"J’ai loué cet appartement pour des amis qui venaient d’outremer. Ils ont été accueillis chaleureusement par Ichraf, une femme très agréable et serviable. Son appartement est très propre, organisé et bien équipé. Elle a répondu très rapidement à mes courriels et elle est resté disponible pour répondre aux questions de ses invités. Ichraf a mis du Lait, du beurre, du Jus d’orange, de la confiture et du pain dans son frigo pour les invités. J’ai trouvé ca très gentil de ça part. Je n’ai aucune hésitation de vous recommander l’appartement d’Ichraf. ","9"
"I have rented this big apartment for some friends who came from overseas. They had a smooth arrival and everything was well prepared by Icharf a sweet host. Her apartment is very clean, organized and very well equipped. Ichraf responded quickly to my emails and she provided my guests with milk, bread, juice, and jam when they arrived, which is very nice from a host.  I definitely recommend Ichraf’s apartment.","9"

"Great","9"
"Great location. Me and a few buddies stayed here for the weekend. Great location. Nearby food spots. Parking wasn't hard to find. We did find a broken light fixture in the kitchen as it had come off its hinges. Nothing major. Balcony was great for a cool down. Listing was as described. I would recommend. Great house, great location. Ichraf was a little behind on responding to messages, but we figured everything out. ","9"
"Nice clean and cozy","9"
"I stayed here with my husband and his mom for 5 days, and we felt very comfortable from the moment of arrival. The place is just as advertised, nothing fancy but very clean, well equipped and cozy. Ichraf is a friendly and helpful hostess, living right next door. Location is good, with only 10-15 min. walks to metro, stadium, and Jean-Talon market. Not much choice for restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but that was not an issue for us. Would definitely stay here again! Perfect for either families or friends.","9"
"Lovely home, photos were accurate, checking in and out was easy and at our convenience.","9"
"Very clean and well kept.  Great location and easy access to a number of places.  Would not suggest staying during the summer months - it was very uncomfortable, especially in the bedrooms, at night with no air circulation. Would definitely stay again - just during a cooler time of the year.","9"
"Despite a minor issues we had a good stay overall.  The location is great and host is responsive.","9"
"Great location in a fun neighborhood.","9"

"Cet appartement était parfait pour nous. Toutes les choses étaient comme vous voyez dans les photos. Les chambres étaient grandes et propre and bien meublé.  Notre host, François, qui habite sous l'appartement, était très amical et utile.  Il a assisté à plusieurs petites choses toute suite.  A Montréal, la location est superbe: près du métro, près du Atwater Marche,  et près des fromageries, boulangeries et épiceries excellentes dans la rue Wellington.  Aussi, le quartier est très calme à nuit. Aussi, le quartier est très calme à nuit.  En bref, il ne pourrait pas meilleur. ","10"

"Francois's apartment is perfect place to stay for a bit.  I stayed for a month, and loved my time there.  The apartment itself is very clean, and has a lot of character.  

I also really liked the location.  Its a quick walk to get back into Montreal across the Lachine Canal, or an even quicker 10 min. subway ride to get downtown.  

And don't overlook the Verdun neighborhood.  There are lots of great restaurants, shops and parks.  I really loved the area. 

Overall, I highly recommend.","10"

A proximité du métro lasalle, 8min à pied. Situé à environ 20min de la ville, c'est le top! Supermarché Metro à quelques minutes à pied. Les photos ne font pas justice à la réalité, nous avons adoré l'appartement. Propre, fonctionnel et dans un quartier calme. Nous aurions prolongé le sejour si c'était possible.

La première impression à l’arrivée est que l’appartement est très propre. Beaucoup d’espace ainsi qu’une belle décoration dans chaque pièce. Un appartement tranquille dans un quartier vraiment agréable. Tous les services à pied, pharmacie, boutiques, SAQ, épicerie, boucherie Viandal, deux bars et plusieurs bons restaurants . On recommande les Street Monkeys, restaurant asiatique à l’ambiance branchée, Chez Boss et fils, ainsi que Piquillo. Nous avons aussi pris une belle grande marche au bord du fleuve, qui est tout près. 
François est vraiment sympathique. Il habite en bas mais ce n’est aucunement un souci. Nous aimerions y retourner, c’est sur. Nous le recommandons.","10"

Very comfortable and clean, it is a great choice whom was going to visit Montreal and enjoy the beautiful charm of old Montréal!","10"
"My friend and I stayed at Yanick's place for four nights.  Yanick was very quick to respond to our questions, and very helpful overall.  He showed us where to find good parking, and checked in on us to make sure things were okay during the trip.  The place was even bigger than it looked in the pictures, and just the perfect size for our needs.  It was clean when we got there, and the bed had fresh sheets and there were towels for us to use.  One thing we wished for was sheets for the futon, since we were not sharing the bed.  There was also no space for us to unpack, because the bureau drawers were full.  Other than those two things, the place was great and not stuffy at all, though it was on the fourth floor.  It's also in a great location, very conveniently located near lots of good restaurants, the waterfront, and the bike path along the river.  We would definitely recommend this to anyone, it is WELL worth the price!","10"
"When I first saw the location and price, I thought this sounds too good to be true. But it IS true! The location is in the middle of everything picturesque - cobblestone streets right when you step out, Old Port and Old Montreal your neighborhood, around the corner from City Hall and numerous restaurants with scenic patios. You can cross the street to Bonsecours Market, or walk 5 minutes to Notre Dame Bonsecours Chapel and about 10 to Notre Dame Basilica. If you want more than what's immediately walkable, Champs de Mars station is very close. If you drove like we did, there is paid street parking around you for short term stays, and many lots to choose from for overnight stays. We personally liked the indoor garage on Gosford and Champs de Mars streets.

As for the loft itself, it has beautiful views of Old Port and Old Montreal, as well as a comfortable mattress and futon. It is well kept, and Yanick will provide you with wifi, a refrigerator full of cold water bottles, along with towels and linens. The pictures are exactly how the loft looks. He will also respond to any messages within a couple of days prior to your arrival, and within an hour or so during your stay. Logistics very easy for check in and check out.","10"
"This location may be the best in Montreal. The place is nice and cozy. Only one problem with the sound, there was always small noise of the air conditioner but if you are not stay at home a lot, it should not be a problem. I will come back if I have a chance ","10"
"Yanick m'attendait  quand je suis arrivé , l'appartement est conforme à la description , sur le vieux port ,rue touristique de Montréal.
bien situé pour allez courir , plein de restaurants autour si on ne veut pas cuisiner, c'est le studio habituellement occupé par Yanick,parfaitement rangé pour l occasion.parfait pour un couple ou
une personne seule ,qui cherche une location centrale .","10"
"Loft très lumineux, spacieux pour deux, bien agencé. Nous avons passé quatre belles journées à Montréal grâce à ce pied à terre merveilleusement situé.
Yannick, indisponible, avait organisé notre accueil et
s'est tenu au courant de la bonne marche de notre sejour.
Un seul petit problème : le bruit de la climatisation. Heureusement  la température baissait bien la nuit et nous pouvions l'arrêter.","10"
"Yanick was a fantastic host.  He was very communicative and helpful.  The apartment was clean and had everything you could want to enjoy some time in the heart of Montreal's historic Old Port.","10"
"We arrived in Montreal a bit late and were fortunate to have international cellphone coverage to message Yanick about our late arrival. He was patient enough to wait for us in the apartment as we navigated around the Old Port to find parking. He spent 15-minutes explaining the accommodations before leaving us with the keys.

The closest overnight parking (1.5 blocks away) is at the Hotel de Ville (Montreal City Hall) and costs 18.75 $CAD per 24-hour period. This is a deal in terms of closeness. The apartment is in walking distance to great restaurants, the waterfront, the Clock Tower beach (our favorite spot to hang out), and public transportation. 

The apartment has excellent air conditioning and met our needs. The bed was comfortable, Wi-Fi was excellent, bathroom was clean, and air conditioning was wonderful during the warm summer days. It's a great location and we would stay here again. ","10"
"It was a wonderful experience at Montreal. The place is at the heart of old port. Everything is within walking distance, kitchen is highly functional, a comfortable bed, washer/dryer and mostly I like the showers- it relieved all fatigue after a long walking. I highly recommend this place!!!!! 
Why wait? This place would make your visit to Montreal good to better! ","10"
"Yanick's place was the **perfect** home base for a weekend escape to Montreal. I stayed for two nights with a friend. The location can't be beat for tourists -- it's literally around the corner from Place Jacques-Cartier and a few blocks from the Metro. As a host, Yanick is a real pro. He was responsive, flexible with check-in/checkout time, and left a fully stocked bathroom. The loft is beautiful, clean, and modern. Full of light. A+, would book again. Thanks Yanick!","10"
"I had a great experience in Montreal.
Yanick was very friendly and had a beautiful apartment. I texted him with any questions i had and he responded right away. The apartment is located in old port and the street- st paul- where the apartment is full of life - restaurants and bars galore","10"
"Yanick's loft is just as described in the listing--right in the middle of the Old Port section of Old Montreal, just steps from the Bonsecours Market and many pleasant restaurants and shops and convenient to the Metro. It's a bustling area, very pedestrian friendly--but quiet enough late at night to sleep with open windows. The place is small but not at all cramped. He has a lovely, up-to-date kitchen with a fabulous Nespresso maker, and he left the refrigerator stocked with water, juice and milk. Yanick is quite personable and welcoming. I arrived earlier than expected and he was most gracious about the mixup. He was also available by text when I needed to ask  where he stored a couple of household items.","10"
"Yanick’s place was perfect for our quick getaway! Right in the heart of Old Montreal, we were a few steps away from numerous bars, restaurants, shops and the water. Everything we wanted to do and see was within walking distance. Leading up to our arrival, Yanick was extremely helpful – he always got back to me the day I emailed him. He provided us with great information regarding parking and places to eat! We will definitely use Yanick again if we return to Montreal! ","10"
"Yanick was a great host.  Communication was excellent. 

Having lived in Montreal I have to say the location is excellent. 

One thing we noticed our first night there was that the bed sheets were not freshly laundered. Problem solved by replacing them with fresh sheets. Perhaps an oversight. 

Bed sinks to the middle but that's us being picky. 

$18.50 per day parking needs to be taken into consideration, luckily the parking facility was near. 

Internet was down our 2nd day though not likely Yanick's fault. 

Good place to stay.","10"
"It was in a great location convenient to so many things. The place was exactly as advertised. Yanick was very responsive. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a place in Old Montreal.","10"
"Staying at the this loft was a true travel highlight. The location is exceptional. The loft is gorgeous. And, Yanick is a wonderful host. Attentive and ready to reply whenever needed, he really makes the place incredibly easy. ","10"
"We had a great time in Montreal and Yanick was an amazing host. His loft is in the heart of Old Montreal and just a short walk to the subway. There are lots of great restaurants, shopping and art galleries nearby. The space is clean and comfortable. My daughter especially enjoyed the view from the dormers.","10"
"Yannick was very friendly, accommodating and great with communicating as well. He met us at the location and pointed out everything we needed to know. There was an issue with the wifi and he quickly resolved it with the provider. The loft is in a great location and was perfect for our vacation. We had everything we needed. ","10"
"Location, Location, Location!! If you're looking to stay in Old Montreal for that European feel, then this is the perfect spot for you. His place is a stones throw away from Place Jaques Cartier. Yanick is a gracious host who made sure that you have everything you need, and if you need anything else, he's a phone call away. Thanks for making our stay a pleasant one. ","10"
"I had a great time staying here. The location was perfect and the loft itself was very nice. Everything was clean and it had all the amenities you'd need. Yanick was a great host and very easy to communicate with!","10"

"What a great find! Yanick's place is in a super convenient location in Old Montreal where you can walk to nearby shops, restaurants, etc. Yanick is a fabulous host! He was very responsive, answered all of our questions, and let us drop off our bags early before check in. The place is really clean and tidy and Yanick even stocked the fridge with some snacks and water bottles for us. Would definitely recommend!","10"
"Yanick's place is fantastic. It's next door to my favorite restaurant in Old Port, Jardin Nelson, and steps away from all the fun Old Montreal has to offer!

The apartment was beautiful, spacious and clean. There were nice hospitality touches such as lavender shampoo and conditioner, and no shortage of towels and washcloths. The bed was comfortable, and the Wifi was fast. The place had great temperature controls, Yanick had the AC on before we arrived so it was comfortable right away.  We didn't use the kitchen because we were only there one night, but the set up was beautiful as well as functional and would have been perfect for dining in if we needed to. 

About the host: Yanick saved my trip- as all our other accomodations and plans had fallen through- Yanick's message to me that he would be able to meet us early to drop off our bags was a beam of sun in a very gloomy situation! He was friendly and so welcoming when we arrived, he let us leave our things while he finished turning the place over after his previous guests left - and he also let us leave our things when we checked out so we didn't have to carry them around the city all day before departing for good.
We didn't have problems but he was quick to reach via text for questions that came up. A perfect host! I only hope his place is available next time we come back!","10"
"Yanick was very accommodating welcoming me at his place.
Loft was perfect for my stay at the Old Port. 
It was literally steps to the restaurants, shops and attractions Old Montreal has to offer.
I will definitely stay here again on my next visit.","10"
"Yanick's place is amazing for anyone wanting to explore Montreal- especially the old part. Its close to so many amazing restaurants and the atmosphere in the area is great! So many old buildings with so much character and only a 5ish minute walk from the Metro. The loft itself is very cozy, comfortable and clean with nice views of the historical buildings close by. Yanick was very kind and helpful- spending a lot of time giving us directions, making recommendations  and making sure we had everything we needed. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Montreal!","10"
"Lovely and very clean apartment in the best part of the city. Great communication with Yanick. Highly recommend!","10"
"I had a very good experience staying in Yanick's location. It's situated on the most attractive old street where you can visit one of the small restaurants or just take a walk. What was important for me is that Old Port is nearby and also pickup point for excursions to Quebec is 2 min walk. At night it is not noicy at all, no music etc from the street. Wi-fi worked without problems. I can recommend this apartment for anyone who is looking for convenient location to explore old Montreal.","10"
"My boyfriend and I came to Montreal to celebrate his birthday.  I am so glad I chose to stay at Yanick's apartment!  It was cozy, super clean and in a perfect location!   He was very responsive and gave great suggestions on new restaurants to try!  Next time we venture to Montreal....Yanick's place it is!!! :-)","10"

"Yanick was great, gave me a tour of the place, and answered my tourist questions. The loft was amazing, clean, organized, quiet, and the windows looked out to iconic Old Montreal. It was close to the metro and bus routes, so getting anywhere in Montreal was easy. You couldn't have a better location!","10"

"Excellent location for new years eve, enjoyed staying in the heart of old Montreal","10"
"Yanick's place was fantastic! It is in the perfect location in old town Montreal with easy access to the entire area - restaurants, shops, historical locations, nightlife - you name it! The home itself is nice and cozy, just as it looks in the photos. It was perfect for the two of us, really nice touches throughout the apartment. Yanick was a very gracious and flexible host. He was also very responsive, we arrived very late at night and had no problem getting in whatsoever. Yanick was helpful in recommending restaurants and things to do. He was right, winter ice skating on the river was a great experience!","10"
"Yanick apartment is in a fantastic location. Theres an elevator so you dont have to climb stairs (so key for late nights in Montreal). The street the building is on is lined with fantastic restaurants, cobblestone and about 100 meters from the river. Amazing. Clean. Cozy and stocked with all the amenities.
","10"
"Great place and friendly hosts! Very highly recommended. Comfortable and perfect location.","10"

"Yannick est un très bon hôte. Agréable, souriant et disponible il m'a accueilli directement à l'appartement pour m’expliquer le fonctionnement de 2/3 choses et me remettre les clés. L'appartement est très sympa, propre, conforme aux photos et situé en plein vieux Montréal à 100m du fleuve. A noter que l'appartement est proche du métro ce qui permet de se déplacer très facilement un peu partout.
En résumé un très bon séjour chez Yannick que je vous recommande fortement!","10"

"Yanick was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. It was easy to check-in/check-out of his wonderful loft and the location is perfect. Would highly recommend staying there and I look forward to another visit.","10"
"Yanick was great, there to meet us when we arrived.  Gave us the quick tour of the flat, which was wonderful.  We knew the city fairly well so didn't really need recommendations, but he was more than willing.  The neighbourhood is fantastic, we look forward to returning, and hope the place is available when we do!!","10"
"Yanick was a great host.  I arrived to Montreal much earlier than anticipated and he made sure I had a place to drop off bags and explore the city while the loft was being prepared, which was prepared and ready for me ahead of schedule.  

He also made sure coffee and more than the basic staples were available when I arrived.  The apartment was clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Ideal for meeting up with friends and going out in Montreal, while taking some time between events to separate from the group and finish some work.  

I will reach back out on my next trip to Montreal and rebook if the until is available.   ","10"
"Yanick has been a great host! His cozy apartment is at the heart of the Montreal's old port, a lively neighborhood with tones of very good places to eat and drink and just a few minutes walk from the city center and most hip neighborhoods. Yanick himself is a lovely guy and made me welcome from minute 1. The place was fully equipped - with a great coffee machine - and very quiet to allow for long hours of sleep :) ","10"
"Yanick was an amazing host, extremely responsive and accommodating. Within minutes of texting, Yanick responded in a helpful way, and he went out of his way to make sure my stay was comfortable. One day I asked about water, and that night he brought a pack of water. The apartment was beautiful(inside and location wise), clean, and comfortable. It was right in the middle of the life of vieux port, yet quiet: I will really miss that. It was perfect for getting focused work done (WiFi was on point too) so I could enjoy my trip afterwards and ideal for winding down after a day of exploring. For anyone that stays here, I highly recommend exploring the neighbouring art galleries: my mind was blown by some of the art there. I would stay here again, and I can't wait to plan my next trip.","10"
"The location was great and had everything we needed!","10"
"Yanick was very accommodating and generous. We felt right at home. Old Montreal was gorgeous and Yanick's place was right in the middle of it all - and was exactly as described! Just a 12 minute walk to the convention center too. It was very charming - quiet, but still central. If you left the window open you could hear the street musicians playing in the evenings. It was a beautiful bright clean space. I felt very calm and relaxed staying there - with nothing to worry about because Yanick had thought of everything! I rested very well and looked forward to coming back to the flat every day. A must stay place for when I return to Montreal some day!","10"
"My wife and I had a great time staying at Yanick's place while in Montreal. It is an ideal location. It is walking distance from a lot of fantastic things in Montreal. The place was very clean and had all the things we needed for our stay.","10"
"It's a great location. The street was being torn up, so it wasn't what it normally would be I'm sure. He was there to meet us, and the place is really well provisioned - water in the fridge, plenty of extra towels - really nice.","10"
"This is a beautiful place that is in a great part of town. It's convenient to many must-see spots, as well as to the waterfront, Bixi bikes and public transport. Yanick is very good about communication. I highly recommend staying here!","10"
"Yanick met us to get the keys and showed us all around the apartment. He made sure we knew where anything and everything we might need was. The listing was amazing and exactly what we were looking for. Yanick checked in on us several times throughout our stay to see if there was anything we needed. Overall a really great experience.","10"
"Yanicks loft was perfect for our trip to the Montreal Canadian Grand Prix!  Located right in old Montreal with easy access to the Metro, Bixi Bikes and a closed parking lot.

Yanick was a great host offering all the usual amenities plus more!  We will definitely stay with Yanick again next time we visit Montreal!

Thanks Yanick!","10"
"Yanick has been a very great host from the moment I messaged him to make a reservation. His response time in any of our requests were very quick. We let him know we were traveling from NYC area, so we would be arriving late, and he was very flexible with us on that. In fact, when we hit traffic and got lost and arrived an hour after our expected time, he accommodated us. Upon arrival the loft was in perfect condition. He took time to show us where everything was, how things worked and walked me back to my car to show me where the garage was to park. The loft is such a gem of a find! The location is perfect for 1st time montreal visitors because it is in the heart of old port. The streets surrounding are booming with lively restaurants, shops and history. Anything we wanted to do was within walking distance so we really didn't have to move our car much. The views from the loft were gorgeous, overlooking the port and the attractions in town. We definitely will be making a trip back to Montréal soon, and we would love to be able to stay at Yanick's loft again!","10"
"Yanick was very accommodating, the flat is well appointed and well located and it has a robust AC system which was very welcome the days I was there.  I also appreciated being just steps to so many restaurants, the vieux port and shops.","10"
"We had a great getaway at Yanick's place in Old Montreal. His loft is clean, neat, and comfortable. And you can't beat the location!!!","10"
"The location of this unit can not be beaten, only about a 100 meter walk to the water! Although not large, for the two of us this place was ideal, especially with the open windows which allow you to hear the birds and music from the street below. Yanick was a pleasure to work with!","10"
"Excellent logement, excellent accueil, excellent quartier. Merci Yanick!","10"
"This loft is very conveniently located in the Old Port area. It is close to dining, shopping, and all the attractions in Old Montreal. The Metro (subway) is just a few blocks away. We found this space to be comfortable, quiet, and equipped as described by Yannick, our host. We would definitely consider staying here again. ","10"
"Fantastic location, so close to Old Montreal. Very comfortable condo. Great restaurant downstairs. ","10"
"We had an amazing time in Montreal! Yanek and his family were lovely hosts. Their place is ideally situated right in the heart of Old Montreal. No need for a car sinc we were able to walk most places and catch the metro very easily just a few blocks away. The place is exactly as it looks. Everything you need is provided. Including some delicious cappuccino. You will definitely be back again on our next trip to Montreal.","10"
"Very nice apartment, amazing location, safe & easy. Great host and the best location we could have chosen. Restaurants surrounding either side of the apartment and shopping surrounding the restaurants. Old Montreal is amazing. ","10"

"Perfect location, clean and comfortable. Location and espresso machine justify the price!","10"
"For our first time in Montreal, the apartment was in the best location possible. Old Montreal is beautiful, and the apartment was gorgeous. Yanick was extremely accommodating, especially since we arrived later than expected. The Nespresso machine was a great feature as well. Parking was kind of a pain, but that's to be expected in a city. Would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Yanick's place is lovely: airy and cozy at the same time, with all the amenities. There *is* music playing for most of the day out in the square below, but that was the only drawback. Otherwise, the location was excellent: in the center of the old town and close to a subway station, not to mention close to the Promanade du Vieux-Port and the jogging trail along the canal. Yanick was there to greet me at the apartment even though my train was late, he humored my bad French, and he was polite even when we had a scheduling mix up my last night. Highly recommended.","10"
"My week at at the cozy loft was great!  Check in was a breeze; I texted Yanick with my arrival time and he was waiting for me at the loft when I arrived.  He also stocked the kitchen with coffee, tea, cereal, and fruit for breakfast, which was a pleasant surprise!  The location in Old Montreal is perfect, there are a ton of restaurants and shops within walking distance.  I definitely recommend staying here.","10"
"Great location. The unit is small as noted but has everything that you need.  We loved the beautiful, exposed, old beams and all the windows overlooking a quaint courtyard with live music. 

Yannic is very responsive and accommodating, checking in with us to see if everything was going well and if we needed anything.  Loved this weekend holiday and will be back.
","10"
"Great location. Yanick was very accommodating. Get this AirBnB!","10"
"My sister and I stayed at Yanick's place for 5 days. It was perfect! Great location and ambiance, right in the heart of old Montreal and near the old port. The street in front of the apartment is under construction, but we did not have any issues with noise. Yanick was a great host, he accommodated our very late arrival and was very responsive to any questions that we had. He also made some extra gestures, ensuring the kitchen was stocked with breakfast essentials, coffee, tea etc upon our arrival. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place with great character in an ideal location.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Responsive and hospitable host, neat loft with everything you need, plentiful fruit and cereal choices for breakfast, great location, nice view, lovely neighborhood full of restaurants and shops. I'll recommend Yanick's place to others. ","10"
"A truly memorable experience, from Yanick greeting us upon arrival, to its convenient location and amenities within the unit (really comfortable bedding/sheets)...this apartment is everything you need and more. 
It is perfectly situated in Old Montréal. It was very convenient for my husband and I to get around and explore for a few days. 
Most of all, Yanick was super helpful and very gracious with setting us up with some breakfast starters (milk, cheese, egg, bread...WOW!) Very yummy coffee provided too which made our mornings much easier :) 
If you're looking for an excellent host with an excellent place, look no further...you've already discovered it. 
Mahalo nui loa to Yanick!!! :) ","10"

His place is in a great location and it's only a short walk away from a bunch of bars, restaurants, and stores.  My two brothers and I spent the weekend there and it was amazing. I'll definitely be booking this place (if it's available) the next time I'm heading to Montreal.","10"
"This place is incredible! It is simple but tasteful, the bed was very comfortable, the location could not have been better (on the fourth floor of a building that opens directly onto the cobblestones streets of the historic district centered around Rue St. Paul.) We had a glorious breakfast every morning with the eggs and orange juice that were provided by Yanick, and made delicious lattes with the cappuccino machine available. The place is between one quarter and one half mile to Champ-de-Mars metro station and right across the street from the magnificent City Hall building. As long as you don't need tons of space, you will not regret booking this spot! ","10"
"Yanick's place in Vieux Montreal was wonderful. It was a tiny, charming space, right on the main street in the tourist district. I loved the wood beams and the decor and the location couldn't have been better. It was great to be in a building with an elevator, since the place was on the fourth floor. Parking was pretty close by. I love Montreal and really enjoyed staying at Yanick's place. I would definitely recommend it to anyone else looking to visit Montreal.","10"
"Awesome location and awesome loft! Host was very accommodating and friendly. Would love to stay here again!","10"
"Our stay at Yanick's place was short and sweet. Yanick was very accommodating to our late arrival as well as our late departure. The place was cute and homely, in a perfect location right in the heart of Old Montreal. Would definitely like to stay here again, but for a longer visit next time! Thanks Yanick!","10"
"Yanick's apartment was perfect and in the perfect location. Yanick is very responsive to any questions and met us at the apartment to explain everything. He provided everything for breakfast in case you needed it (cereal, milk, bread, eggs) and also has a Nespresso machine for you to use in case you want to make yourself something. There is pretty much everything within 5 minutes of Yanick's place and even better you can open the windows to hear live music. Would definitely recommend staying here. ","10"
"Yanick's apartment was cozy, clean and in a wonderful location.  The bed was very comfortable and we had everything we needed. In fact, even more because there was  coffee, bread, cereal, eggs, milk and other staples that we were free to consume which we thought was a lovely bonus.  Yanick was very friendly and promptly replied when contacted. He was waiting for us when we arrived.  Everything was perfect and we would definitely stay here again. Thank you so much Yanick! We loved your place!","10"
"Yanick made me feel welcome right away. He came with groceries and  water and showed me how to work the espresso machine as well as the TV. The place is beautiful and really could not be in a more perfect location in Old Montreal! The views are beautiful and despite the busy square nearby and the construction out front, the loft was extremely quiet and cozy. Yanick made it feel like a home away from home and I would definitely come stay here again or recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal! ","10"
"Yanick was great and so was his place. I was in town on business and needed a place. Yanick was easy to communicate with and his place lived up to my expectations: excellent location, clean, organized and a comfy bed. ","10"
"I can't speak highly enough about my experience staying in Yanick's place. He and I coordinated via text prior to my arrival about when to meet after departing my train. Yanick gave me a tour of the place, including how to use the TV, set up WiFi, how to use the Nespresso Machine, where the laundry was, etc., and he even had offerings of groceries for breakfast. I used the kitchen to cook several meals—a kitchen that is fully equipped with pots, pans, spices, utensils, etc.—and found myself right at home. The loft itself is absolutely stunning, and in an ideal location. It was quiet, comfortable, and a perfect size for my 4 days there. Every evening, I enjoyed live music in the central plaza, seen from the windows. I absolutely will be staying here again in the future. I can't thank you enough, Yanick, for the hospitality. Your place is a gem.","10"
"Amazing spot, really close to everything. Yanick's place is really awesome, cosy, clean and beautiful !
We would'nt doubt to go back!
We even had groceries and other goodies","10"
"Summary: Quite frankly, I prefer to stay here than in a hotel.  Great location, very clean apartment, helpful and friendly host.

Location: Located right in Old Montreal where the major tourist spots are.  About 5 to 10-minute walk from closest metro and bus stations.

Apartment: The apartment itself was in a very clean and tidy condition.  Almost everything from towels, to kitchenware and utensils, to free laundry... had all been meticulously prepared for you.  The only minus was that the A/C was not functioning properly during my stay, so it felt slightly hot during the day, but still tolerable since Montreal was getting cold at night during my stay anyway.

Host: Mr. Yanick was very friendly and very quick in replying when I needed help for directions in Montreal.  Great host overall!","10"
"À mon arrivée ,Yannick m'attendait pour m'expliquer le déroulement  et les commodités du loft . Ce fut très courtois et le logement fut amplement à la hauteur de mes attentes. Très beau très propre et beaucoup de commodités  et d'équipements même le café et le petit déjeuner étaient inclus très appréciable. Vu le temps pluvieux le câble via Internet fût commode. Lit très confo . L'emplacement du logement est idéal et sur une rue du vieux Montréal qui est près de tout . Je n'ai aucun commentaire négatif .","10"
"This was my first time visiting beautiful city Montreal.
And which made my little trip more perfect was this place where I stayed.
First best about the palce is Its location. You cant find anywhere better than here. Its just across the old port and just few steps from Place Jacques Cartier. I enjoyed walking nearby everyday.
And Bixi is just across the street if you are fan of biking.
Second best thing was house itself. It was very clean, cute kitchen has everything you needed, although i dont cook much but you will definitly find it comfortable using it. Nice clean bed and washrooms and etc. 
Third, the host was very attentive. Explained about the place and greeted when i arrived. You can find how it is attentive when you stay there how well he prepared little things in the house for you.
It was very great experience for me and i am very glad i made decision to stay here for 10 days. ","10"
"Yanick was a great host. His loft is beautiful, cozy, tidy, clean, and the location is amazing. He made everything extremely easy, and provided us with everything we could have needed during our stay. 

I highly recommend staying here!","10"
"Yanick was a perfect host.  He answered questions right away as they arose during our stay, and checked in to make sure all was well.  The apartment was quiet, serene and a nice temperature, which I was concerned would be an issue visiting in mid-November-- instead it felt great.  Its a cozy and straightforward studio but has all the amenities you would need. The kitchen was nicely stocked, and the water pressure in the shower of the clean bathroom was fantastic.  The location was ideal, close to the port and steps away from tons of good food. I would definitely consider coming back.","10"
"Yanick's communication was excellent, we were booked almost immediately and was great in setting up our check-in.  The apartment is all yours.  It's a perfect studio set-up for a couple, with a full kitchen stocked with most things you could want and a fridge full of water, milk, eggs, cheese, etc.  Thanks Yanick!  The bed is super comfortable, the Wifi is good, bathroom is super clean.  The location is GREAT!  Right across from the Marche Bonsecours and right on Rue St. Paul, not sure it gets better than that if you're looking to explore Old Montreal's shops, restaurants, and night life.  Close to the Place d'Armes and Champ-de-Mars subway stops if you want to check out other areas of the city as well.  Can't wait to come back. :)","10"
"The best location in the city. Very clean.","10"
"My wife an I enjoyed a wonderful stay at Yanick's loft.   We were met by Patrick who was a terrific and responsive host. He helped us carry our bags into the loft, provided local activity information and gave us a tour of the loft's amenities Yanick's place is centrally located and surrounded by the most wonderful restaurants, you will not have to search for a great meal.   Shopping, dining, museums, cathedrals and galleries are mere steps away on Rue St. Paul.  You will be in the center of everything.","10"
"This was a lovely apartment in a great location. Parking was tough, but luckily there was a metro station and bus stop close by. Yanick was a great host - he was very communicative and had good suggestions for things to do in the area. I'd definitely recommend the apartment!","10"

"Yanick's loft in Old Montreal was unbelievable! Yanick made sure I was all set up at check in and was great making sure I found out where to go. The location was dreamy, a two minute walk to everything Old Montreal has to offer. Listen to the bells of Notre Dame de Basilica from the loft and explore the cobblestone streets for exquisite restaurants and bars. Thank you again to Yanick for everything!","10"

Yanick was a great host making us feel very welcome and giving us lots of good information about exploring Montreal.
The apartment is warm and cosy with lots of character. Location is fantastic in Old Montreal with lots of things to do and see in walking distance.
I could recommend this place more highly.

"Could not recommend enough. The place is immaculate. The location is excellent.","10"
"As I only spent a total of 7hrs at Yanick's place (arrived late and had to leave early for a breakfast meeting), I didn't get to thoroughly soak in the ambience of his loft suite in Vieux Montreal. The bed was comfy and the place was clean with all the amenities one would need - I especially loved the high quality towels. His place would be ideal for someone wanting to authentically experience living in Vieux Montreal. I was very impressed with the prompt level of response from Yanick and how he went out of his way to make sure I got in when my train arrived late.","10"
"Yanick's place is beautiful, exactly as pictured and very clean. It was so fun to stay directly in Old Port! I definitely recommend using the parking garage he suggests in his description - it makes this super easy. Hope to stay here again!","10"

"Yanick est un hôte parfait: agréable, attentionné, toujours soucieux du bien-être de ses voyageurs. 
Le logement est propre, agréable, fonctionnel, très bien situé au cœur du Vieux-Montréal. Un endroit et un hôte à recommander!

"2nd time...","10"
"Yanick's place is PERFECT. It was right in the centre of Old Montreal so everything was within walking distance. The apartment is cozy but had everything you'd ever need and more! Nice and clean, well-appointed, and Yanick is a great host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and made exploring Old Montreal a blast. The only downside is the lack of parking in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) biggie though coz there was pay parking just a block away from the apartment. We ended up paying $40 for 2 full days, not bad at all i think. All in all i highly recommend Yanick's place, it was just perfect!!!","10"
"I have nothing bad to say about the place or yanick. The place so absolutely adorable and very clean. 
The bed was like a wonderful cloud that hugged you. 
I would definitely go back, it's in a great location. 
The only issue I had was finding parking, had to walk a bit to a parking garage but other then that no complaints ","10"
"My 19 yr old son & I took a road trip to Montreal and wanted to experience Old Montreal, in all it's quaintness. This was the perfect place for us to stay! Yanick was a wonderful host. He was great with communication too, which was helpful since we are from the States and had never visited French Canada before. We would have loved to stay for longer!","10"
"This place will be top on my list for future business trips to Montreal. It is perfectly located in Old Montreal. Yannick is a great host and stacks the place with the little things that make a big difference. Big thumbs up on this Airbnb!","10"
"Fantastic location! So much charm in the old town and so close to the water (only one block away). Easy to walk to many bars, restaurants, and the riverwalk! Great stay. Thank you! ","10"

I highly recommend it","10"
"Couldn't ask for a better location for our stay in right in the middle of Old Port! Yanick was a great host and his apt offered every amenity you could want; Netflix, nespresso machine, breakfast, soft towels, umbrellas for use- just to name a few. Highly recommend!","10"
"Yanick's place exceeded our expectations!! Although the dwelling is located on one of the main streets in old Montreal, it is very quaint and quiet and very picturesque. The house is wonderful and the bed is very comfortable. Yanick's hospitality was warm and welcoming and he even left us things for breakfast and coffee pods for his coffee machine. I would recommend his house to anyone! Another added bonus is the Netflix, incase it is raining. 5 star accomodation!!!","10"
"Great stay - very clean, quiet and comfy, with ALL the amenities. Highly recommended. Located in the heart of Old Montreal, yet a secluded spot off the street - almost forget where you are! ","10"

"It was my first time renting with AIRBNB and my first time in Montreal as well.  I have to say that Yanick's place was 10 times better than what I expected. The location is in walking distance of some of the best tourist spots that even if I had a spent only a day I would have left home happy. The loft is cozy and all the amenities that Yanick provides makes you feel at home. He provides breakfast from fresh eggs, coffee, variety of cereals, fruit and the list goes on and on. For me it was so easy to be able to wake up and have those items available to start the day as it is something that I am use to having available in my home. His home is exceptionally clean which makes you feel as if you are staying at a high end hotel chain. His recommendations on where to visit Montreal turned into my official tour guide. One of the reasons I wanted to visit Montreal was because I had heard such great things regarding the city and people. We are happy that our stay at Yanick's was proof that the city and the people are absolutely MARVELOUS!!!","10"
"This apartment was perfect for our four-night stay. We were in the middle of Old Montréal, easily could walk or take the metro or bus anywhere, and had access to everything Montréal has to offer. ","10"
"Yanick's place was amazing. Right in the centre of Old Montreal with quick access to everything you would want or need. It was also incredibly clean and had great amenities that I don't often seen in airbnbs, such as the Nespresso machine, breakfast foods, and bottled water. Unfortunately, I only stayed one night. I will most definitely be back for many more. ","10"
"This place is in the most perfect location. You can get up and be right there in all the main beauty of old port. The place is small but cute. It's is exactly what you need while traveling. I fell in love with this and asked to book more nights. So make sure to book in advance and to stay here as long as possible because it books up quick. Perfect location with wonderful useful items inside (i.e.umbrellas, hair dryer, towels, espresso machine, breakfast items.. etc.)","10"
"Emplacement idéal pour visiter le vieux port et alentours. 
L'hôte nous a gentiment attendu 2 heures, méfiez-vous des bouchons. 
Nous avons apprécié la mise à disposition de nourriture dans le frigo. 
Et nous avons beaucoup aimé les produits bio pour la douche et le bain. ","10"
"We had a very good stay. Appreciated the milk, cereals and fruit for breakfast. The location is perfect and I appreciated the cleanliness of the unit. Yannick was also very patient with us due to the fact that the suggested parking was not high enough for our truck. It took us a while to find suitable parking and Yannick stayed until we returned. I highly recommend this unit in the heart of Old Montreal.","10"

"Kiitos Yanick mahtavasta majoituksesta! Majoituimme kolmestaan kavereiden kanssa. Aamupala-ainekset olivat erittäin hyvät, kavereitten mielestä yllättävän monipuoliset: Leipää, levitettä, jugurttia, pannukakku-ainekset, vaahterasiirappia, munakasainekset ym. Nespresso-kahvikone antoi potkua päivään. Sänky oli erittäin hyvä, hyvin mahtui kaksi kaverusta siihen nukkumaan. Futonilla eli sohvalla nukkui kolmas. Tykkäsimme asunnon laventelituotteista. Kommunikointi Yanickin kanssa oli helppoa ja nopeaa. Asunto oli keskeisellä mutta rauhallisella paikalla. Kiitos, meillä oli hieno viikonloppu Montrealissa!","10"

"Yanick's apartment was perfect and exactly as described. It's location can't be beat and I really enjoyed my stay!","10"
"Perfect. My stay was just a bit better than expected - I say that because you can read MANY positive reviews about Yanick's place on this page. The 'bit better' part was experiencing Yanick's generosity in sharing information, food (fridge stocked ""this is all for you"") and heart. His kindness set me up for success in all my interactions with les Montrealais. Stay here if you can.","10"
"5 star location in the heart of old Montreal. Short walk to metro station. There is more than enough to see and eat in old port that you could essentially spend an entire weekend walking the cobblestone streets. 

Yannicks loft is well kept and the amenities are thoughtful and convenient such as the espresso machine and breakfast. 

Would highly recommend.","10"
"Yanick is a special host in the Airbnb community. I have stayed at many places in the past 5 years on Airbnb. This has to be the best valued Airbnb I have ever been in.  Yanick provides all the urban amenities needed, and special touches throughout the studio. One of the best features of this studio in fall is the live music outside the window in the public square. When I was in the studio, I left the windows open (in autumn) and listened to the street performances nearby. The studio was warm, homemade, comfortable, cozy, and full stocked. I cannot wait to return to Montreal and stay at his house again","10"
"parfait en tout point.... je le recommande sans aucun hésitation..... j’ai adoré mon séjour chez yanick","10"

"Yanick is a very likable host! The place is a lovely home and is suitable for a single traveler as well as groups. The location was spectacular, and it was very quiet at night inside the unit. This is the spot to stay in if you are experiencing Montréal for the first time!","10"
"Historic and charming! One can almost feel the ghost of Charles Dickens (a one time visitor) wandering the halls of this former hotel in the center of old town Montreal!","10"
"Lovely, cosy and quiet loft in old Montreal-was just as described. There were beautiful views and a homey atmosphere. Yanick is a superb host. He was quick and spot on with answers to all my questions and has an extremely welcoming manner. He waited there to greet me despite a fairly late arrival and as other guests have mentioned went the extra mile supplying fruit, milk and breakfast food for the stay. Loved the loft!","10"
"Yanick was a very nice man.  He meet with us when we arrived and provided more than we needed.  There was food in the apartment which saved us a bit of money, and everything worked well.  One thing to note is the fact that there are no near by places to buy beer at a wholesale value, meaning there are only bars and restaurants around the apartment.  We had to walk over fifteen minutes away to find a place that sold beer (it was in Little China).  Other than that the stay was pretty much perfect, although like Yanick said, the apartment was a little small for four people.  Although we managed just fine.","10"
"L’appartement est très bien situé, surtout quand on a à travailler au centre-ville. Dans un lieu historique, majeur pour les Patriotes. Merci!","10"
"Yanicks place was very clean and in a perfect location for a nice weekend getaway in the old port of Montreal. He graciously left us food for breakfast and greeted us when we entered. We had everything we needed and more! Would definitely reccomend this apartment to family and friends or anyone looking for a great place in a great location!","10"
"Great place amazing location!! Espresso and fruits a lovely extra - highly recommended","10"
"Yanick was an amazing host during my time in Montreal. He was great with communication and made sure I was satisfied throughout my stay. There were also several thoughtful touches, such as a fully stocked kitchen. 

The place itself is in an ideal location for touring Montreal. It's a beautiful loft in a historic building. You know you're staying in a great place when you see other tourists stop to take pictures from the outside :)

Overall, a wonderful stay and I hope to be back!","10"
"I would rate an 11 on a scale of 1-5. Yanick met me at his home and walked me through the operations. He left breakfast items,fresh fruit, o.j., coffee, tea, in addition to the usual bedding and such.  The location is outstanding! Most convenient and charming district; great restaurants, shopping, Two museums, plus a spa are within walking distance. The Metro is an easy walk. This is a modern unit with beams from the 17th century. The original structure is otherwise hidden, but Charles Dickens stayed at the same address. Next time I visit Montreal I hope this unit is available.","10"
"This is a great loft in a great location! Yanick ensures to have breakfast and coffee available. It was very warm in such cold weather. No issues and Yanick checked up on us through our stay which was nice.","10"
"Il s'agit d'un petit studio très propre et très bien situé dans le cœur historique de Montreal
Le propriétaire est très réactif aux messages, aimable et ponctuel.
On aurait aimé savoir qu'il s'agissait d'un studio car Une chambre est précisée dans l'annonce. Mais comme il s'agit en réalité d'un studio le lit est dans la pièce à vivre. 
On entend donc le bruit du frigidaire la nuit par intermittence.
Le lit situé dans un coin n'est pas facilement accessible pour la seconde personne. 
Si vous louez en janvier, il vaut mieux regarder les dates du festival de musique electro "" Igloofest"" qui a lieu le jeudi, vendredi et samedi 2 semaines en janvier car on entend un peu les bruits de la scène .

","10"
"My experience here was wonderful and I'd highly recommend to anyone staying in Montreal.  I'd never stayed in this area and wanted to try it out.  Yanick's place was perfectly located just a couple blocks from the Metro.  Also, you could walk out the front door and be directly in the middle of the cobblestones of Old Town.  He was very good about making sure everything was perfect and was kind enough to text me during my stay to make sure I had everything I needed.  When I arrived, there was fruit and breakfast options available, along with simple things like a couple bottles of water and an amazing coffee maker.  He just got all the details right.  Definitely stay here if you can!","10"
"We stayed in this lovely loft for one night on our honeymoon and are so glad we did! Everything about this place is fantastic: it’s comfortable and clean; it’s a quiet unit right in an unbeatable and lively location; Yanick’s hospitality and communication is great; five stars all over!","10"
"Very cute spot in the heart of old port. Yannick the host was very helpful. Loved it!","10"
"Yanick’s place was completely awesome! The space was beautiful, in a great location and had everything you could need for your stay in Montreal. Yanick was easy for communicate with and the check in process was very simple. Was nice  to explore all day and then come back to  lay on the couch and watch Netflix on the TV ;)","10"
"If ever my wife and I travel to Montreal again, we will certainly be looking to see if this place is available first thing. It was a great stay and the Old Port district is so charming. We walked to the Bell Center for a hockey game from here with no problems, enjoying the downtown sector as well. An altogether pleasant part of our honeymoon.","10"
"There is a reason why Yanick and his BNB have a 5 star rating!  He is a very gracious host, communicative and very accommodating.  The loft is clean, cozy, and in a great location.  
I will be returning upon my next visit to Old Montreal!","10"

"I highly recommend Yanick's place. He is very nice and his place is located in one of the best locations in Montreal.","10"
"Yanick was a great host - very quick to respond and accommodating - and his place was great. I had been a bit concerned from the photos that it might be chilly being an older place that looked a bit like a converted attic, but when I arrived it was nicely warm and I didn't have to make any temperature adjustments. The place is very private and secure, with the extra benefit of a keyed common entry and keyed private entry. I had expected something like a single room in a hostel-like setting but it's actually more like a hotel including an elevator. All the photos are accurate and the location is great - easily walkable distances to explore the city. My best AirBnb experience yet and I'd definitely stay again.","10"
"This is the place to be.  Loved every minute of the trip.  The location is in a exciting part of Montreal as well.","10"

"My friend and I had such a lovely stay in Montreal at Yanick's studio apartment. It was clean, comfortable, and he generously provides an array of breakfast foods and cooking staples (oil, vinegar) and amenities to actually cook dinner too (which we did). The neighborhood felt extremely safe. Thank you so much for hosting us, Yanick.","10"
"Emplacement très bon, à 5 minutes du Métro et dans la Vieille Ville. Excellent rapport qualité/prix. Bon accueil, le frigo était garni pour le petit déjeuner ! Beaucoup d'attentions de la part de Yannick, logement très propre et confortable. Je recommande ! Idéal pour une ou deux personnes.","10"
"First off, Yanick's description of the location is spot-on! His loft is located right on St. Paul Street in the heart of the old town. If you want the European experience without going overseas, then this is the spot.  Yanick's loft is wonderful.  It's comfortable and well appointed with anything you may need if you forget to pack something :-) As a host he was kind enough to wait for us when we were arriving late (which we very much appreciated) and he gave us some good tips on the surrounding area.  Finally, you cannot beat the value. What Yanick offers is unbelievable at the price - you cannot go wrong here.","10"
"Nice place near everything!","10"
"Yanick was a wonderful host, and his home was so beautiful and in the perfect location. We loved everything about it and it really made our trip special!!","10"
"Cozy studio apartment with all of the amenities needed to comfortably spend a day indoors, or return to rest after a busy day of exploring. The neighbourhood is quiet and very peaceful at night. We enjoyed being removed from the liveliness of downtown at the end of a busy day. We didn't spend a great deal of time in Old Montreal as we found it expensive and preferred to explore the more culturally diverse areas of Montreal. It was easy to walk to most of the areas that we had more interest in exploring. Overall Yanick's home was cozy with lots of extras (Nespresso, fruits, milk, eggs, cereal, etc). It was very clean and Yanick was responsive and punctual. We weren't left waiting for him to arrive and greet us after our long drive, which we appreciated.","10"
"O apartamento é ótimo, localização perfeita, 5min andando pro metro, 10 andando para á Notre-Dame, 2 min da roda gigante. Apesar de ser um local muito turismo, durante a noite é muito tranquilo, ótimo para relaxar! O apartamento tinha cereais, café suco e iogurte! Vale cada centavo!","10"
"Lovely apartment, walking distance from all the tourist attractions but also very quiet and fully equipped, if you ever want to escape the crowd and spend an evening at home. The perfect place to explore old Montreal! Also, Yanick is a great host: he always available and flexible about my check-in and chek-out time.","10"
"Yanick’s place is a cozy studio apartment near everything in Old Montreal. You can’t beat this location. Open the door, and you’re in front of Marche Bonsecours. It’s perfect for two people. Everything you need to cook a meal is in the kitchen and the bathroom has everything you forgot to bring.  Yanick was there to greet us when we arrived to show us around and explain the Nespresso machine to us (which we needed). The water bottles and coffee he provided came in handy! We would definitely stay here again.","10"

"This was our first Air BnB experience and I’m glad it went smoothly.  Our host, Yanick is very nice. 
The place is very clean.  Plenty of hot water and excellent water pressure. The location is perfect, everything is close by, you are right on old Montreal East.

We are so thankful for the breakfast items provided as we could not find a restaurant nearby that served breakfast (we only checked the street of St. Paul), so we went back to our room and made egg sandwiches, yum!

We will definitely be back and would definitely recommend this place! ❤️","10"
"This place is amazing. We can't fault it! A beautiful apartment right on the middle of the old part of town - so accessible. Teena brought us everything we needed for breakfast and made us very welcome when we arrived. Oh and the shower was probably the best one I've ever (Website hidden by Airbnb) powerful! There's a lot of thought that's been put into this listing and it really all adds up to make a perfect stay!","10"
"Surrounded by history and culture, Yanick's place is in a perfect location in Old Montreal. There are countless restaurants, bars, galleries and churches nearby (within five minutes or less), and Ste-Catherine is only a 15-minute walk away. Yanick was kind enough to stay up and let us in well after his regular check-in time—great host.","10"
"This is a very cute little apartment in the heart of all of the action of Old Montreal. The location literally could not have been better as it is at the back of the building (so it is quiet), but only steps from great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. Yanick is a great host. He not only provides sight-seeing tips, but umbrellas, bottled water, high end coffee, and breakfast items. We truly enjoyed our stay and will be back.","10"
"Excellent location. Walk to everything. Very clean apartment. Nice extras in the fridge for breakfast.","10"
"Beautiful space and AMAZING location! Yanick is such a thoughtful host. he was there to explain everything when I checked in and was very understanding when my flights to Montreal were delayed three times and I checked in very late. Place is very clean and tidy and the bed and pillows are very comfortable. I would love to stay there again when I'm in Montreal. beautiful eats around the apartment and it's very close to all the touristic destinations in the city. Loved my stay!","10"
"Our stay at Yanick's was wonderful!

"This best Airbnb we have stayed in to date. Yanick is a wonderful host and went the extra yard in every aspect. I could not recommend this place highly enough!","10"
"Great location in the heart of old port. Super close to public transport, restaurants and bars. The space is nice and light and Yannick thoughtfully included supplies to use during our stay.","10"
"Excellent compromis.
Appartement fonctionnel et idéalement situé pour découvrir Montréal au mieux.","10"
"Fantastic studio in the heart of the old city. Yanick was kind and met us to show us the place and give us the keys. Thanks, Yanick! ","10"
"The location of Yanick's sweet little loft was incredibly convenient for exploring.  We didn't take our car out of the garage once we arrived walking to great sights to see, places to shop, and of course great food.  A very comfortable bed after a day full of activity was a huge plus.   If we get a chance to visit Montreal again in the near future I'd certainly hope The Loft was available.","10"
"Incredible location! Perfect. Yanick made the entry easy and we had no problems. Would highly recommend!","10"
"Amazing place in the heart of old downtown!! Yanick is quick to respond and his apartment has everything you need!!","10"
"This location is really as good as it gets for visiting the old city of Montreal. In addition, the apartment was generously stocked with breakfast foods. ","10"
"Nice and clean loft in a perfect location. It is right on Saint Paul St. Comfortable bed. Has all necessary amenities. Thoughtful host, Yanick met us at check-in and shared some local tips. I would definitely recommend.","10"
"The perfect place for Montreal escape!","10"
"If you have never been to old historic Montréal, this is the place in the heart of it.
The metro is in walking distance, clean, will take you SAFELY to Park Mont Royal, large, green and safe,( bus 11) or the botanical gardens. Walk downtown, eat in Chinatown, shop on rue St. Cathrine. Airport taxis take you to the front door, literally, for $ 30 US.
Yannick had lots of breakfast supplies, including a great Nespresso machine .","10"
"Yanick’s place is in an amazing location in the heart of old Montreal. The place was very cute and the check in process was very easy! I’d stay there again!","10"
"Me alojé con mi esposa 5 noches en setiembre 2018. El departamento es de un ambiente en el 4to piso (con ascensor) en muy buen estado. La ubicación es perfecta, en el medio de la zona del puerto antiguo de Montreal, caminando a muchos restaurantes, bares y tiendas. Siempre tuvimos botellas de agua, café Nespresso, cereales, jugo, yogurt, fruta... el anfitrión muy atento y preocupado por los detalles. Volvería a quedarme en mi próximo viaje.","10"
"We enjoyed a lot the stay. Very considerate details like the amenities, and breakfast options. We liked the wooden floor.","10"
"Yanick's place was exactly as described. Fantastic location in Old Montreal with a ton of restaurants and bars conveniently close by. Check-in was easy and Yanick provided everything that was needed including breakfast foods and drinks in the refrigerator. He also responded very quickly to questions that I had during my stay.  The place was clean and cozy. I highly recommend his place if you travel alone or with 1 to 2 others.","10"
"Convenient location and very clean!","10"
"This is a fabulous little apartment in a dream location.  Right in the heart of Old Montreal, you’re surrounded by places to check out, restaurants to eat in, and walks along the waterfront.  
The kitchen was such a treat, so well stocked - I saved money and time by eating at ‘home’ occasionally.  And the style, with those beams!, was excellent.  Couldn’t have been happier.","10"
"Great location if you want to be in the heart of Old Montréal. I would definitely stay there again.","10"
"Great location, clean charming unit with nice view of street life. Enjoyed my stay. Easy check-in process.","10"
"We loved Yanick's place! A great location to get anywhere with really affordable parking nearby. Right in the heart of everything but incredibly quiet at night. Can't recommend it enough as a perfect spot to land in Montreal!","10"
"This loft is in a great location. We stayed two nights and enjoyed the space and Netflix in the evening after spending all day walking and eating our way through Montreal’s lovey neighbourhoods. 

The directions to the loft were excellent and Yanick was waiting for us to check in when we arrived early.
Check out was straight forward too.

Would recommend this for a romantic getaway.","10"
"Amazing location and a great host. Clean, very comfortable bed, with food for breakfast in the fridge. Thank you Yanick for a great hospitality.","10"
"Perfect location!","10"
"A fantastic location and a great little base for your holiday! Yanick is a great host and is easy to communicate with. And as a bonus, he thoughtfully provides provisions for breakfast which makes your stay so much easier! The location of the apartment is amazing and transport was really easy with the nearby Metro station. I would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Best Airbnb I have stayed in! Can’t beat the location if you want to see Vielle Ville. On the oldest street in the City. Everything was superb in the space—all I needed plus quality soaps/options/bath products/tea/Nespresso machine, soft sheets, eggs, cheese, cereal, more than I’ve seen in a typical Airbnb. Well designed space, comfortable, amazing views from window.  I just might go back!","10"
"Had a great stay! Beautiful location and charming space.","10"
"Great place & location for anyone wanting to explore old Montreal. Will definitely spread the word.","10"
"Great place, great location, great host","10"

"Perfect cozy space in Old Montreal! Yanick is a great host and the apartment is clean, spacious, and very cute! Could not have imagined a better place for my stay in Montreal!","10"
"Yanick's apartment was wonderful. It is a great, cozy place for two people and in a good location. Everything was very walkable and Yanick offered suggestions for food and activities. The apartment was clean and stocked with breakfast amenities.","10"
"Perfect everything!  If I go to Montreal again, I will still stay here. Five-star recommendation!","10"
"Yanick's place is perfect for solo travellers as well as couples, with a cozy feel to it. The location is perfect, check in and check out were  a breeze, and communication was excellent. The place itself is very well equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  All in all, this was one of the best Airbnbs I stayed at, and I would love to come back and stay here on my next visit to Montreal.","10"
"I was very busy at a conference during my week-long stay, so I hope to stay there again sometime. Location amazing, place was perfect for my needs, very reasonably priced, having a bit of starting food in the fridge was extremely useful especially when just arriving. Really great!!!","10"
"Great host, great location , great apartment!","10"
"Yanick's place was absolutely wonderful. as soon as you walk in, you're in a much larger loft than the pictures can show. There were nice breakfast amenities during the stay, as well as the place being very clean. 
Lastly the location as mere steps from just about everything in  vieux Montréal, and even then, public transportation and the more hip downtown is within walking 10-20 minute walking distance.","10"
"Fantastic location in the heart of Old Montreal near an abundance of restaurants, bars, and other shops. The complimentary coffee and breakfast was appreciated. Would highly recommend!","10"
"He was very helpful with local restaurants and parking. A lot of stuff in the kitchen for breakfast which is amazing.","10"

"great place","10"
"Fantastic space, fantastic location.","10"
"Nice, clean space. Enjoyed the clear instructions and parking tips. Definitely would recommend again.","10"
"Our first night we walked to the port to ice skate and then to a great little brasserie for dinner and music. It was so nice to have both at our fingertips. The location was out of the way for the heavy tourism which made for nice and quiet nights. 

The mattress is firm so take that into account if that matters to you. 

Thanks for a nice clean apartment during our stay in Montreal!","10"
"Great stay - thank you Yanick!","10"
"Yanick's place was so good and it is within walking distances of many tourist attractions and even a metro station. He is also very accomodating, helping me to check in even outside the designated check in times.","10"
"Appartement très sympa et propre. L'appartement est très bien situé et Zaki nous a très bien accueilli et nous a donné des conseils pour visiter Montréal.
Ce fut un super séjour ! Je recommande fortement cet appartement !","9"
"Zaki est un très bon hôte, accueillant et disponible.8 L'appartement est très sympa et idéalement situé pour visiter cette belle ville. A recommander!


Zaki is a very nice host, available and welcoming. The flat has an perfect position to enjoy this beautiful city. To recommend!","9"
"Appartement super, extrêmement calme à la joie de mes parents qui ont aimé leur séjour. 
Ressemblance parfaite avec les photos. 
Situé à deux pas du métro et de l'avenue Montroyal, parfait pour les tous les achats ! 
Très propre. A recommander !","9"
"My host, Zaki, was welcoming and responsive.  I had a very late arrival (close to midnight) and he was there to great me and see me into the place.  The place was just as it was described and was away from the street noise and quiet which was great when I needed to sleep.  The place is situated in a great spot with easy access to the metro and Bixi bike rental which I used.  Cafe's and places to eat are a block away.  Overall it was a great experience, with a great host, in a great place!","9"
"Lovely apartment, sparkling clean, well equipped and a super comfy bed! Well located on a pretty street very close to the Metro, it doesn't overlook the street so very quiet (not that it's a noisy street!) Great to have a laundry room right next to the flat - $1 each for wash and dry. Fast wifi. We loved it there.  Highly recommended!","9"
"Appart très bien situé sur le plateau et super tranquille. Stationnement très facile à trouver à proximité. Communications excellentes avec le proprio. Idéale pour un weekend en couple mais l'espace est restreint j'hésiterais à y passer un plus long séjour a moins d'être seule. Je recommande si vous prévoyez profiter du quartier.","9"
"Quartier très sympa proche de toutes commodités.","9"
"The host arranged to have his brother waiting for us on the doorstep with the keys. It was very convenient. The neighbourhood is central to the plateau in Montreal and yet it was quite quiet ... just as advertised.","9"
"Very accommodating! We arrived late and Zaki was very nice and patient. Apartment true to photos and in a great location! Host very helpful. We stayed one night, there was free parking out front. Worked out great!","9"
"Really great location!
Close to the metro and bixi bike is on the corner of the street!
Mont royal was a really nice neighborhood and with being polite to everyone about not speaking French the hospitality industry were happy to speak English with a polite attitude
Zaki was able to meet us before our stay and let us know any small details about the place, clean and tidy apartment perfect for 2 for a week getaway!
Would come back to stay here in a heart beat! :)","9"
"Was easy and great!","9"
"Zaki very kindly met up with us to deliver the keys and gave us a few tips on where to go to enjoy the neighborhood. We loved the street and the neighborhood where Zaki's place was! The apartment was comfortable and had basic amenities such as towels and wifi. Highly recommended place for a weekend getaway to the true Montreal!","9"
"The place was everything we needed. It's a nice quiet neighborhood with street parking. Zaki helped us understand the parking signs. The kitchen was equipped with what we needed to enjoy our market goodies. The porch pictured faces the back yard, which allowed us to sleep with the doors open and screen closed. I suggest bringing dvds or a tablet for movies because there is no cable. There are many bars and restaurants you can easily walk to. Great stay!","9"
"Zaki a été formidable.
L'appartement était propre, central, tel qu'annoncé.
Hautement recommendé.","9"
"Zaki is flexible with our check in and check out time,easy to communicate. The house is clean and tidy, and has every thing you need. Great host.","9"
"Zaki was a perfect and fantastic host! The apartment was everything you would need for a stay in the best neighborhood in Montréal. Clean, tidy with all the necessities. A short walk from shops, bars and restaurants. Would stay again! ","9"
"Zaki was a great host. The studio was clean and in a convenient area. I would definitely recommend.","9"
"Zaki's place was great! Very clean, comfortable and quiet, and exactly what we needed. Zaki was very easy to deal with and always quick to respond to any questions we had. He was very accommodating with check in / check out times and the neighbourhood is amazing! So close to the metro and lots of great coffee shops, bars and restaurants right around the corner. Would stay here again for sure! Highly recommend!","9"
"I loved the location, near subway and restaurants and bars. The stairs to door were very steep and not suitable for elders or drunks. The unit was not bright or cheery. The TV should have cable TV or at least hd cables for your computer. Also toilet paper would be a bonus! ","9"
"Zakis apartment was clean and functional, although a bit sparsely decorated. I was a great place for us to crash during a weekend in Montreal, we could walk to all the best bars, restaurants and boutiques in and around Le Plateau and Mile End within 35 minutes. Actually, we hardly left the area except for a shorter visit to the old city. The check-in process could have been smoother as we had not received adequate information on what floor or apartment that was for us, however, Zaki was quick to reply when we texted for more info and was very flexible in regards to our stay. ","9"
"Très sympathique logement, fidèle à la description. Zaki était particulièrement arrangeant et très sympathique. 
Seul petit bémol sur la literie qui n'avait pas l'air d'avoir été changée alors que des frais sont prévus justement pour cela. 
L'accès se fait via un escalier colossal alors prévoyez un ami aux gros bras si vous avez quelques valises à monter.","9"
"L'appartement est très bien situé dans le quartier du plateau. Le métro est tout prêt et le quartier plein de restaurants et bars.
L'accès à l'appartement est simple. Tout le nécessaire est présent, tous était propre et confortable.

Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de rencontrer Zaki mais il est resté disponible et réactif à nos messages. 

Je recommande sans hésiter !","9"
"The apartment is exactly as seen in the pictures. The location of the place is superb, 5 min walk from Mont Royal station and in the midst of a great cafe/restaurant scene. There are multiple gems on the side streets of Mont Royal Rue too! Overall, we had a great time in Montreal and this place was exactly as we expected! 

For future stayers- 
It's a no frills, basic place with most amenities. The cable TV does not work and there were no toiletries - so bring your own shampoo and soap! Per previous reviews, the steps leading up the apartment are extremely steep, so it's difficult if you have a large suitcase. 
","9"
"Very close to metro. Some really greater local diners in the area. Zaki was very easy to reach. We had some internet problem when we first arrived due to snowstorm but he fixed it as soon as he could. The TV didn't turn on but we didn't really need it. Great stay overall.","9"
"When we arrived at Zaki's place the temperature was about -10 degrees Fahrenheit. The apartment heated up quickly and was very cozy. It is clean, simple, and well-equipped. Some amenities we appreciated were two bed-side lamps, hooks in the bathroom, and an extra comforter for the bed. The apartment is in an excellent location--near Avenue Mont Royal, Rue Rachel, and Rue du Duluth. There are so many appealing restaurants nearby. It is also very close to the beautiful Parc La Fontaine. We had planned to be out and about far more than we were, but due to the frigid temps, we were inside quite a bit and it was so comfortable and pleasant. We hope to be back!","9"
"This is a great location in Montreal.  Close to great restaurants and not far from downtown.  Zaki was great and made it very easy to check in and out.  The apartment was very clean and much more cost than a hotel.  Couple things to note, parking is a problem as street parking is for permit holders so you risk getting a ticket.  Also the tv didn't work for us.  It turned on but we couldn't switch the media source to use the DVD player.  Wasn't a big deal as we were only there for the night but something to note for longer stays.  All around a great place to stay.  Thank you Zaki!!","9"
"The neighborhood is amazing. We walked everywhere - lots of cafes, shops etc. The street is also nice and very typical of Le Plateau. It's a stretch to call the apartment ""Grand Luxe"" as it's very basic and functional. It would have been helpful to have better instructions for the lockbox as we had lots of difficulty getting entering the apartment. The TV didn't work for us and there were no instructions for the WiFi but it was clean and quiet.","9"
"Zaki's studio apartment was clean and cozy when we arrived.  It's small but has everything you need.  It's in a multi-unit building, but it was very quiet.  And the location is terrific!—very close to the Mont-Royal metro station and rue St-Denis so you have quick access to the whole city.  And there are plenty of great places to eat right in the neighborhood as well.   

Parking is on the street which can be a challenge, as per usual for Montreal.  Just read the signs closely and be prepared to park a couple of blocks away.  

Zaki was very gracious to me about my stilted French and we managed to communicate well, so don't worry if you're not a French speaker.  My husband and I highly recommend booking with Zaki.  Merci mille fois, Zaki!","9"
"The apartment was ideal for a weekend in Montreal. It is well-appointed and clean, although not ""luxe,"" as described. The neighbourhood is lovely and lively, but the apartment is quiet. ","9"
"Zaki was a wonderful host! Incredibly fast to respond and very helpful. The apartment was perfect, clean and in the best spot in montreal! Highly recommended! ","9"
"Studio was as described. A perfect place for exploring Montreal and feeling relaxed and comfortable after a long day touring. We found the Studio to be in a very quiet area. Neighbourhood pleasant and refreshing. Zaki had left great instructions on making arrangements for the keys. No problems at all and no surprises. Everything required was available in the Studio.","9"
"Great, comfortable little spot. Great location. Clean. Zaki was available through messaging easily. Would stay again in a heartbeat. ","9"
"Agréable studio, calme et bien placé sur le plateau entre métro Mont-Royal, et ""La Banquise"" haut lieu de la Poutine. Attention, l'accès a la cour intérieur n'est pas autorisé. Zaki, est vite joignable, toujours avec une solution. Une remarque cependant, le minimum permettant de faire un café ou un thé en arrivant n'était pas assuré. il a fallut vite recourir au dépanneur, c'est le seul bémol à apporter à notre trop court séjour chez Zaki. l'appartement de Zaki est a recommander.","9"
"We didn't see or meet Zaki which was fine as we were busy. The place was pretty clean although the corners had dust and the cracks of the chairs had crumbs. One block form the Metro station with bixi bikes even closer. Galley kitchen with pots, pans, glasses, cutlery etc but no supplies (salt, pepper, sugar, oil etc.) Good for reheating leftovers or pre made meals. It was quiet as it's in the back of the building although there is only one window, the sliding door in the bedroom, and when the heat exchanger for the building is running it is fairly loud as it's directly below the door. When we were there the screen door was  unusable, just leaning against the side of the building and the garbage can was full, stinky and 3 feet from the sliding bedroom door. Fortunately it wasn't really hot while we were there so we only had to close the door once because of the stink. I noticed a bike rack in the backyard, good spot if you brought your own bikes although at $100/night you're probably going to spend another $5/day for a bixi pass if you want to bike.","9"
"Great location clean and great price. Really tough to beat. I did not have the chance to meet Zaki but he was responsive and a great host. 

Highly recommended if you are traveling alone or as a couple.
","9"
"Très bon séjour à Montréal et l'appartement de Zaki y est pour beaucoup. Fidèle à la description il est propre et dispose du nécessaire à la première journée. Dans un immeuble calme et silencieux. Le seul bruit du matin est le chant des oiseaux de la cour arrière. Plutôt agréable. Zaki à été très clair pour la remise des clefs et très réactif lorsque j'avais des questions. Je reviendrai à Montréal, je reviendrai chez Zaki.","9"
"The room was clean and in quite a nice area but dont be decieved by the shot from the street its very small and was very hot only a fan which barely helped and a TV with no service just a dvd and no selection. I guess you get what you pay for. Also very steep stairs to access. Good value for young people with little luggage.","9"
"Earlier this month, we stayed in the studio apartment in the Plateau  neighborhood of Montreal (hosted by Zaki).  We loved the charm of the building & neighborhood (and the cleanliness of the apt).  The studio apt. was the right size for two of us who were more interested in exploring Montreal than staying around in an apt.  The apt. is a short walk to the Metro station (at Mont Royal) and a short walk from MANY dining and entertainment options.  Zaki even recommended a couple of places for dinner (we choose the ""best poutinne in Montreal"" spot).  We knew that the apt. didn't have air conditioning (as stated) but we were disappointed that the only screened opening in this interior apt. was broken.  If you are thinking of visiting in the heat of summer, this is less than ideal.  The other issue that people traveling by car have to be aware is the lack of parking in this entire area.  There is free parking in limited spots but it is only for certain times of day, so we either had to hang around the neighborhood jumping from spot to spot or risk getting a ticket (they don't tow)...we got ticketed (but were lucky because we only received one ticket in a two day period of time).  But, even though there were some issues to deal with, we loved the feeling of being a part of this active Montreal neighborhood.  P.S. The eclairs at the bakery in the Sherbrooke were the best!!","9"
"Comfortable and clean place to stay. Many amazing places to eat within 5 minutes walk from the location. The main ""downtown"" to see in Montreal was about 40 min walk away.

Parking: there is a spot for about 4 cars right in front of the building where you can park most days and overnight (minus the few hours on the day listed on the street parking sign) 

Host was wonderful with responses. Only thing missing was that we ran out of toilet paper during the 2 night stay because there weren't any extra in the apartment. Host was apologetic that he hadn't gotten a chance to restock before our arrival.","9"
"Logement très bien situé dans un quartier très vivant, tout près du métro et des commerces, tout en étant agréable à vivre. Le propriétaire a été très accommodant pour les horaires, merci!","9"
"Zaki's house is in the great location, very close to the Metro station and local shops and restaurants. However it is very small and some amenities were lacking. Zaki is very responsive and tried to sort out some of the issues the best he could.","9"
"Great stay. Close to EVERYTHING. Location perfect.","9"
"The apartment was absolutely perfect for a weekend in the city. Everything was clean, and the check-in process was quite smooth. The location couldn't have been better. There are tons of cafes, bars and restaurants within walking distance - we hardly had do use public transportation at all! (Although the metro is conveniently nearby the apartment as well.)

10/10, would recommend. Thanks, Zaki!","9"
"super quartier prêt du métro mont royal.
Zaki nous a mis les clés à disposition.
Magnifique bâtiment, appart très agréable et balcon privatif ainsi que laveuse et sécheuse accessible.
Super rapport qualité/prix","9"
"organisation rapide simple et efficace. l'appartement et très calme et bien situé.","9"
"Great place with an even better location. Walking distance to all of the main streets. Tons of shops and restaurants nearby. Would definitely stay again.","9"
"The location of this space is AMAZING...the space is perfect, it's got all you need...but it was a bit pricey and some things need to be taken care of in term of cleanliness...I've informed Zaki...I'm certain he will work on it. 
Also Zaki was very accommodating and responsive.","9"
"Bonne communication, bonne localisation, photos authentiques, rien à dire!","9"
"L'appartement est tout à fait conforme à la description. Il est très, très bien situé dans un quartier que nous avons beaucoup apprécié.
Nous y avons séjourné 6 nuits pendant les fêtes de Noël et nous avons été sous le charme. Si nous devions revenir à Montréal en Hiver, nous le relouerions, et cela nous donne envie d'y revenir en été.","9"
"Merci, ce fut une excellente expérience! ","9"
"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Endroit idéal pour séjourner à Montréal. Appartement propre, bien situé, tranquille. À recommander sans hésitation!","9"
"Incredible apartment. We couldn't have found a more perfect place to stay one Montréal. We were close to great restaurants, the neighborhood was great, and the apartment was very clean!","9"
"Appartement très bien situé et très bon rapport qualité prix.","9"
"This apartment is amazing for up to 2 people for an indefinite amount of time. The location is amazing, 1 block in any direction to food and sights. Bed is comfortable, with plenty of space in the bedroom. Full bathroom and kitchen, with breakfast table was more than you need for a trip where the main purpose is to binge eat! Quiet apartment, never heard or saw any neighbors, and the street is mostly families so no problems with rowdy folks. Multiple ""out of town"" parking spaces located right in front, just read the signs on the street! Easy check in/check out/ Great communication! We would/are absolutly going to stay here again!","9"
"Zaki was great to stay with. We never actually met but he assisted on very short notice when our other airbnb screwed us around... His communication was great and everything about the place was as advertised. Easy and convenient for us and we were able secure a parking spot right in front of the apartment","9"
"Lieu agréable, tranquille et central. ","9"
"Appartement idéal pour découvrir Montréal.  Le métro est à 2 pas. Le quartier est sans doute le plus agréable de la ville. Rien à redire. Zaki est très sympa et arrangeant. A recommander absolument","9"
"The location was great! The apt was clean for the most part with the exception of a dirty towel hung on back of bathroom door, no toilet paper upon arrival, and I also found some of other guests' hairs on the bed linen (definitely were not mine). The apt has the basic amenities EXCEPT the wifi did not work at all. I reached out to the Zaki and he said he was out of town and that he would call me the next day but I never received a phone call or any form of follow up. ","9"
"Studio calme et bien situé.
Pas de WI FI et TV. Aucun élément de confort à l'arrivée, boisson, papier toilette, café, lait.
Le propriétaire n'était pas présent durant 3 jours. correspondance que par sms.","9"
"Zaki's apartment was just as described: clean, comfortable, and perfectly situated. It is just around the corner from a big park and a five minute walk from the metro as well as the best areas in the city for shopping, eating, going out. The kitchen had all the cooking utensils we needed to cook but isn't stocked so if you plan on cooking bring your salt and pepper etc. There was an issue with the wifi before we arrived but Zaki communicated with us and had the issue fixed shortly after we arrived. ","9"
"Zaki's place is quite nice. It is in a fantastic location! Very close to the Metro, restaurants, bars and shops but on a quiet street. Best of both worlds. Zaki was quite good at helping out with a couple problems that arose like letting me keep my bags there a few hours past check out.","9"
"This is a great studio.  Everything you need for a comfortable retreat.  It was surprisingly quiet given that it is centrally located.  Just tucked away above a courtyard. I would definitely  stay again.","9"
"Logement calme et proche de toutes les commodités, commerces, restaurants, transports en commun...
Idéal pour 1 ou 2 personnes sans problème physique compte tenu de la pente de l'escalier extérieur.
La cuisine et la salle de bain sont des pièces aveugles.","9"
"We stayed in unit 3 and while it was not the worst place to stay it was not great. It is not a home. It looks like a full time rental with essential needs met but not very clean.","9"
"Bon emplacement sur le plateau du Mont Royal.  Appartement calme, bonne literie. Salle de bain agréable. 
Dommage que l'appartement soit sombre. Les jours de chaleur, le ventilateur est insuffisant... Une climatisation serait bienvenue.","9"
"Studio confortable et pratique (buanderie dans l'immeuble, cuisine et salle de bains très bien équipées), très bien situé, proche du métro, des commerces, restaurants  et d'une piscine gratuite rue Marie-Anne. Grande disponibilité du propriétaire . Le quartier est très agréable, rien que pour s'y promener en admirant les maisons et les jardins et en rencontrant des Montréalais, toujours prêts à parler avec des Français ! De bonnes conditions de logement pour un excellent séjour !","9"
"Zaki's place was centrally located and in a great neighborhood. It was also quiet at night. I appreciated the fact that he had a fan in the apartment as it could get stuffy during the evening. We had a great stay in Montreal!","9"
"Great location but had a couple of issues both of which should be easily corrected by the host for future guests.
The big problem was unit had no a/c and it was summertime hot and we could not cool the place down - net effect was two difficult to sleep nights. I called the host and he text me that there is no a/c and will just have to sleep with the sliding doors, to the outside, open at night - there are no windows in the unit. There's a fan that we kept on but it just blows hot air around. I tried a bucket of ice in front of the fan but could not cool the place down.
The other issue is given a $40 cleaning fee, while the place looks clean, when I turned on the shower the water back up because of hair and guck in the drain. Some towels did not smell clean and bedspread/sheets had some stains.  Not a big deal but when charging a $40 fee not acceptable. 
Overall, we were mainly disappointed because it should not cost the host much to have a small a/c unit that can be turned on for hot days and nights and that would have made all the difference.","9"
"We unfortunately found ourselves in a situation where our airbnb was completely uninhabitable, but our host was not willing to provide a refund. On the evening of our arrival, we soon discovered that the bathtub faucets were in such disrepair that the water could not turn off after use. As the tub filled up quicky with water from the broken faucet and a bad drain, we had to use kitchen pots to bail water out of the tub for 40 min until the host arrived. Although Zaki was immediately reachable by phone, we were unable to communicate our issue due to the language barrier. After hanging up to write to Zaki on the airbnb app, he said he would come to the apartment in 20 minutes. He did arrive until 40 minutes later.

He arrived and managed to turn the faucet off by jamming and twisting the shower head toggle and tap at the same time. Clearly, he knew the faucets were broken before but did not bother to fix it. Further, it seemed that he had broken the faucet even more in the process of turning the water off. So at this point the hot water knob no longer worked and water could only come out of the bottom spout, and not the shower head. Then, Zaki tried to tell us that this was due to ""city work"" when clearly, anyone could look at the shower and tell that it was in bad shape to begin with. He then suggested we could shower by using the KITCHEN POTS to catch water and pour over ourselves. We told him that we were leaving and he agreed to refund us the rest of the trip (2 nights). Later, when Zaki had left, he messaged to tell us that he would only refund us $200 even though we paid $108 per night plus $100 in service fees and cleaning fees.  We ended up wasting the entirety of our first day and half in Montreal dealing with the bathtub situation and filing a complaint with airbnb customer service. Luckily, they were extremely helpful and got us the full refund. 

Another thing to note is that the apartment was not clean. There is a strong odour that is noticeable as soon as you walk in. The coffee maker easy used by the previous guest and was left dirty. ","9"
"Zaki's place was great- quiet, clean just as advertised. Loved the neighborhood as well.
Zaki was very attentive and quick to respond as well ","9"
"It was a perfect location and a comfortable bed. I walked virtually everywhere I wanted to go (grocery store, restaurants, bars, etc)","9"
"Just for the neighborhood, it is a great place to stay. It is perfectly located on the Plateau Mont-Royal, near SO MANY restaurant and hot spots, near the subway or at a walkable distance from downtown. The home itself is a bit small, but very clean and quiet. We had a few problems with the shower (hot water not closing), but we were warned by Zaki about it (even if a  bit late : two hours before arrival). Except these few details, we had a great week-end in Montreal !","9"
"My stay was great! Zaki always got back to me when I tried contacting him. Would definitely stay again!","9"
"Le studio de Zaki est vraiment très bien situé sur le Plateau, proche du métro Mont Royal et de nombreux restaurants. 
Le studio est bien pour dormir (en journée il est très peu lumineux). 
Lors de notre séjour (3 nuits), des poubelles étaient abandonnées devant la maison, ça faisait très sale par rapport au reste de la rue. 
Nous n'avons pas vu Zaki mais il a été disponible par messages et nous a très bien expliqué le check-in/check-out. 
Ce n'est pas un studio ""grand luxe"", mais bien pour quelques nuits.","9"
"Amazing location! Zaki responded message very quickly and solved our problem very soon.","9"
"Le logement est vraiment bien placé, à 5-10 min de marche du métro. Il est un peu sombre, mais très très calme, pas entendu un seul bruit en 3 nuits.
Zaki est vraiment disponible à tout moment, c'est très appréciable !","9"
"Perfect location! Literally walking distance from the metro, must-try restaurants and shops.","9"

"Appartement très calme dans un quartier agréable.","9"
"Perfect stay in a perfect studio, just right for a couple or a lone traveler visiting Montreal for a few days!","9"
"This apartment is in a nice location between two main areas. Zaki communicated well with us and had excellent food recommendations! However, the place was not as clean as we would have liked with leftover food in the cupboard and microwave, and unclean bedspread. Other than that we enjoyed everything available in the kitchen and the easy location.","9"
"Zaki was a great host. He goes above and beyond to make sure that their guests are happy. The apartment was great and we had a lovely time in Montreal. Would recommend the place wholeheartedly.","9"
"Well located and quiet location. Very helpful host that replies quickly. Kitchen is manageable for basic cooking if need be.","9"
"Loved our stay at your place, luxurious apartment and great location and great communication. Thank you Zaki.","9"

"I was in Montreal in November 2018 ! Zaki, the owner was very welcoming and helpful ! He came to meet me , told me everything, was attentive and responsive ! The apartment is in a very convenient location , everything you need is available , beautiful apartments and the owner ! I recommend","9"

"We had a lovely stay at Yann’s place. The apartment is very large and bright with lots of house plants. Gizmo the cat is very friendly and a nice addition to the apartment. Yann was very helpful and explained everything thoroughly. Very comfortable bed and ample amenities. Short walk to metro station, Mile End and Little Italy. Would stay again!","10"

"Staying at Yann's place was like being in cozy cottage in the country. - spacious, quiet and charming with a very welcoming and friendly host~!!!","10"
"Yann’s place was well stocked and easy to find. We used the back entrance for parking, which was convenient, and he communicated well from the start to the finish. Recommended!","10"

"Vero was out of town at my arrival so I didn't have the chance to meet her in person. I got the keys from the neighbor. The place was decent and clean. Amazing location close to everything.","9"
"My girlfriend and I stayed at Véro's for a couple of nights. Everything was as we expected. Although she was out of town, here boyfriend was there to receive us and show us around. He was very kind, and was available via phone for the duration of our stay. The apt is cute and clean, with character. The neighbourhood is interesting and has plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars, shops. Feels completely safe. Close to the centre and subway stations, making it very convenient. Completely recommended. 
Thank you Véro for letting us stay in your lovely place!","9"
"Vero was really good host! She prepared everything, and room was very clean! Also, neighbor was kind person :) I'll stay here again for sure when I come back to Montreal!","9"
"Vero welcomed us into her very cozy and comfortable home with open arms, and we gladly fell into this place of warmth and well-being. Her workshop-style home is colorful and full of board-games and books which kept us busy through the cold bleak storms of winter. She gave us great recommendations for local attractions (Drawn and Quarterly For the Win)  and Depaneur Cafe.

Overall a lovely stay. Vero is awesome, very helpful, and very attentive to the needs of her guests. 5 stars","9"
"We loved staying at Vero's place! Vero was super communicative with us. We didn't get to meet her because of holiday travels but her friend met us at her place and gave us a ton of recommendations for where to go and showed us how to use the keys. The area was really nice and close to all the fun neighborhoods. We had a short stay but we were able to walk to all the different neighborhoods suggested to us (even in the snow!) and check out a lot of independent book stores and really great coffee places. The apartment is exactly as pictured and a very nice place to stay for the weekend. We hope to come back and possibly stay at Vero's workshop in the Village again!","9"
"Appartement vraiment très agréable à vivre, cosy, avec une jolie cour intérieure, le métro à 5min à pied. Véronique a été très sympathique lors de nos échanges par mail. Nous recommandons chaudement la maison-atelier, ça a été un très beau séjour :)","9"
"The shower head is amazing. I also like the beach themed decoration. Tonton est super gentil.","8"
"I stayed here for just one night and even though it was short and sweet, I still enjoyed my stay. The house is absolutely stunning. I spoke no French but the family still managed to communicate with me. They made me feel so welcome and comfortable. ","8"
"We had car troubles and got to the house very very late, but the daughter of the house (I unfortunately did not catch her name) was kind enough to stay up and let us in. We only stayed one night and left in the morning but the  room was comfortable and as expected!","8"
"We were welcomed and given a key to come and go as we please. The place was pleasant, quiet, and comfortable. The temperature was well kept, we had a private restroom, and a sofa lounging area to use outside of our unit. A very nice home with a swimming pool in the back!","8"
"We didn't expect the location to be quite so far out of downtown but that's on me. It helps to have a car to make the trips rather than taking a bus or train.
Very comfortable room and bed and a very friendly and accommodating family home.
The ability to speak French is a big plus but Jamal speaks very good English and he helped us a lot.
We did enjoy our stay.","8"
"Louis's family is awesome!!! Everyone is so nice, the house is clean and new. I love everything. 
Thanks for your perfect hospitality!!!","8"
"My friend and I rented the apartment for a weekend and we really enjoyed it. The location is great, close to downtown, but in a quiet neighborhood. The place is very clean and decorated with good tase, it shows that Ildiko enjoys taking care of it. The kitchen is spacious and has everything needed to cook. A large windows and a wide patio door make for lots of sunshine. The bed is big enough for 2 and very comfortable. Ildiko provided clean sheets and towels. There was also more than enough closet space for us. Ildiko and her appartment definitely made our weekend in Montreal very enjoyable and hassle free. Looking forward to visiting again.","9"
"bonjour,  tout était conforme aux descriptions, logement bien placé proche du centre, rien de spécial a dire. Parfait comme ""pied a terre""
Mily

"L’appartement est super confortable et très pratique, parfait pour visiter la ville de Montréal. Très près du métro et de l’autobus, et situé à une courte marche à pied du centre-ville (station de métro Berri-UQAM), je recomande tout à fait cet endroit. Même si Ildiko était en dehors de la ville durant notre séjour, nous avons été parfaitement bien reçus. Notre hôte, Glen, était courtois, polis et toujours disponible pour répondre à toutes nos questions, via texto, courriel ou téléphone. Il était aussi très flexible pour les heures de départ et d’arrivée. Il avait préparé l’appartement pour nous recevoir adéquatement avec tout ce que nous avions besoin pour être confortables. De plus, le rapport qualité/prix de l’appartement est excellent, car il s’agit d’un tarif très abordable. Merci pour tout Ildiko et Glen!!!","9"
"Very nice and warmly place, near to the downtown, big supermarket nearby, we can find everything we need in the apt. Really good experience.","9"
"Il y a beaucoup à dire sur cette location, ce que je ne comprends pas c'est que les précédents commentaire ne les évoques pas malgré le très bonne accueil de la part du Glèn, un ami de l'hôteLe plus important,  la propreté,  malgré les apparences,  le logement est sale. Pas seulement une saleté des locations précédentes mais plus anciennes. De plus une odeur fortement désagréable, que nous n'avons pas su faire partir de la cuisine. Il n'y a pas de moustiquaire dans la cuisine donc dès que l'on ouvre la fenêtre ce sont mouches et moustiques qui rentrent. La moustiquaire de la chambre est percés en plusieurs points et très difficile à fermer. Les rideaux de la cuisine ou de la chambre sont soit déchirés ou sales. Il n'y aucun rangements mises à disposition dans la chambre pour y ranger nos affaires, puisque toutes les commodes sont déjà remplis de vêtements de la propriétaire, ce que nous trouvons pas normal. Malgré sont prix attractif, nous déconseillons se logement.","9"
"Ildiko was a great host! She wasn't able to accommodate us herself but she made the proper arrangements to make everything go as smooth as possible. The place was very tidy and the location couldn't have been better. It was just what we were looking for. I would definitely consider booking with Ildiko again when I am in the area.","9"
"Check in was very easy, the place was nice & clean, and just how it was described in the listing. The neighbourhood is great, and all the necessary amenities were very close by.","9"
"Logement conforme à la description et aux photos, deux stations de metro accessible à pied en 10-15 minutes, le seul problème que le quartier est résidentiel et les commerces super marchés épicerie se trouvent à 15-20 minutes a pied de l'appartement mais la promenade dans le quartier est très agréable en été, le dépanneur est à 2 minutes de l'appartement mais ce n'est pas suffisant pour manger ","9"
"Everything was in order and as explained on the posting and during 1:1 conversations with Françoise.  Perfect, cute, clean apt with everything we needed for our 1 week stay near the Stadium! ","9"
"We had an excellent stay and the apartment was perfect. The kitchen was well-stocked, making it very easy to cook meals. Everything was just as advertised. Free parking was always available on the street. The neighborhood was quiet and away from bustle of the city, yet everything was just a few metro stops away. We went to the Round of 16 World Cup match, so the proximity to the stadium was great. I'd definitely recommend the apartment to everyone, it couldn't have gone smoother. Thanks, Françoise!","9"

"Eric made check-in easy! Overall this is a great property. Highlights:
- nice bed / folds up into wall for extra space
- quiet building
- internet is fast when I tested (10 mbps up and down). Wireless and wired internet available.
- interesting view overlooking Place des Festivals
- TV and cable were convenient for watching hockey. TV accepts HDMI input.
- dishwasher!
- Braun coffee maker
- only two flights of stairs to great rooftop patio
- the unit receives a lot of AM sun which is nice, but bring a sleeping mask if you sleep late.
- the building's ground level retail includes a useful convenience store
- great location!","10"
"It was one of the best places I've stayed through AirB&B and Eric gave me plenty of good city advice.","10"

"Séjour au cœur du festival de jazz! Appartement propre, moderne et bien équipé. Très bon accueil d'Eric.","10"
"Nous avons d'abord communiqué avec Eric par mail et nous avons tout de suite senti que nous avions affaire à quelqu'un de sérieux et de très gentil. Tous nos mails ont eu des réponses rapides. 
Il a fait en sorte que notre arrivée se déroule parfaitement et c'e fut le cas ! :D
Eric est venu nous faire une petite visite après quelque semaines pour savoir si tout se passait bien. Nous avons eu l'impression qu'un ami nous rendait visite.
L'appartement lui même était tout à fait conforme à la description et à nos attentes. Tous les équipements que l'on pourrait souhaiter sont disponibles et flambant neufs.
Très bien situé et au coeur du quartier des spectacles, nous avons tout fait à pied (tout près des commerces rue Sainte Catherine, 20 minutes du mont royal, 25 du quartier du Plateau...) et le métro est au pied de l'appartement.
Le seul ""bémol"" serait que les nuits étaient parfois perturbées par les activités bruyantes du quartier. Mais ç'a n'a en rien gâché notre séjour.","10"
"Amazing view of Place des Arts. 

This appartment was perfect for us. Not just a great location (just in front of Place des Arts Subway station, a block away of a grocery store) but it has a great view of Place des Arts. I really enjoyed the look at the Festival Mode & Design, from the appartment's window.

Very good Equiped: dishwasher, hairdryer, plenty of tableware, you can easily cook anything you want. It has Air conditioner, which was perfect for those hot summer days. Washer and Dryer inside the appartment.

It was a very clean appartment. You feel like in a hotel room, plenty sets of  white sheets and many clean towels, if you want to change it.

 I had to check in earlier, so I had the chance to meet the cleaning Lady, who was really attentive. 

If I am back to Montreal I would rent it again, no doubt.","10"
"This is hands down the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in! Eric was the perfect host, communication was excellent! The apartment was amazing, spotless, fast wifi and the perfect location in Montreal. 

We were a 10 minute walk away from old town and right on the main shopping street! There's so many places nearby ie grocery store & coffee shops and also right next to a tube station if required. 

Absolutely no negatives! ","10"
"Bon séjour dans le studio d'Eric. Il a été très disponible pour répondre à mes questions et faciliter mon arrivée et mon départ.
Le studio est bien, très bien équipé. Il correspond bien à la description et aux photos. ","10"
"We never actually met Eric as he was working abroad, we did however speak on the phone, he was very pleasant and helpful. Eric's brotherinlaw dealt with our entry into the apartment and everything went smoothly. 
The accommodation was exactly as described and could not have been better, it was perfect for transport, both buses and metro, also easy to walk to most tourist areas. I would certainly recommend Eric as a host to anyone visiting Montreal, I know he has more than 1 apartment and I would imagine they are all of the same high standard. ","10"
"Bonjour je suis resté 1 semaine à Montréal dans l appartement de Éric qui est très fonctionnel et très bien situé dans le quartier des spectacles je le recommande vivement","10"
"Eric was in touch with us before arrival and he met us upon arrival.  We arrived early in the day, dropped our bags at the apartment, and began exploring Montreal. The location is perfect for public transportation and exploring on foot.  We stayed for a week, enjoyed the ""backstage pass"" from the roof-top terrace, and slept well. Eric recommended a great sushi place just a few doors down! The hot water, ac, and washer dryer were all welcome.
The location made it easy to tour, shop, eat, return for a rest, and begin again.
Would stay here again and recommend it highly.","10"
"Eric was great.  He was always in contact with us and made sure that we arrived safely.  As soon as we arrived, we spoke with him by phone and he gave us some information about the apartment.  We asked him about restaurants and grocery stores in the area and he was a great help.  Very nice host.","10"
"Eric was a great host!  He was very helpful when we asked him about the city and the space.  He always responded to any questions we had promptly, and he was so kind, going out of his way to make sure we had a great time in Montreal and at his apartment.  As for the space, it was perfect!  It is located across the street from the metro, walking distance from St. Catherine st, and there is also a grocery store, a top rated cafe, and a top rated creperie on the street within 1-2 blocks of the apartment.  The space was clean and beautiful.  We loved staying here! ","10"
"We loved our stay at this lovely apartment! The place was clean and exactly as pictured, and Eric was a great host! The location is right by the festivals in downtown Montreal (we were there for the first week of Just For Laughs), and close to shopping as well as old port. Would highly recommend! ","10"
"Nous avons été très bien reçus par Éric, l'appartement était très propre, mignon et bien équipé (sèche cheveux, équipement de cuisine, serviettes de bain...) et en plein centre ville, ce qui était très pratique (la bouche de métro est juste en bas de l'immeuble). L'hôte était toujours disponible par téléphone ! Nous avons pu profiter de notre séjour comme nous le voulions ! ","10"
"L'hôte à vérifié que nous puissions bien rentrer dans l'appartement que nous avons trouvé très confortable et très propre .","10"
"Eric's apartment was in a great location.  He was very accommodating and was reachable whenever we needed him. The description and pictures in the advertisement were a good representation of what you can expect. Overall, great experience and a very kind host. ","10"
"The apartment is very conveniently located. Almost everything you would want to do in Montreal is within an easy walk. The apartment has a nice view of the fountains at the Metropolitan Art Centre. The shopping district of St Catherine street is a couple of blocks away. It's close to McGill and so lots of cafes and Bistros in the area to hop in and sip a latte. The apartment is well furnished. There is a washer dryer in the bathroom. 
The kitchen is well equipped but the cookware is limited to a large pot to boil pasta. So you may have to buy a cheap pan if you plan to cook at the apartment. Adequate crockery and cutlery is available. There are provision and departmental stores just around the corner. There is a cafe on the ground floor of the building. 
Eric made the check in process super simple and organised. It was like we were walking into an apartment we had lived in for months. Truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider staying at the same place in the future. ","10"
"Great studio in a central and vibrant location! The Metro is a 2 minute walk away (if that), making it such a breeze to get most places. The space itself is perfectly suited to a solo or couple travelling, and was very clean when we arrived. Eric was a fantastic host who was very clear and helpful when we had questions. Would highly recommend!","10"
"I stayed for about 3 eeeks at Eric's while in MTL for business.  The location is central and steps for the metro which worked well for getting to the office and back this winter :)

Eric was very communicative before my arrival and once I arrived.","10"
"L'emplacement est génial.  Au coeur du centre ville, du quartier des spectacles et près du vieux port de Montréal.  Tout se fait à pied et en transport en commun.","10"
"Ottimo soggiorno. Posizione veramente centrale, vicino a tutti i servizi: bar, negozio alimentari e servizi pubblici nelle vicinanze. per raggiungere il centro non servivano i trasporti pubblici.","10"
"Eric's place was perfect for me. Great location and had everything I needed. Everything went very smoothly. Thank you Eric!","10"
"The location was perfect and the condo was comfortable, great location, well worth it, and clean.  Eric was great at communicating quickly with us and I would recommend Eric's Airbnb condo to anyone.  I hope to return and stay if you would have me.","10"
"I stayed at Eric's apartment for 2 weeks while working on research for my dissertation. I could not have asked for a more gracious, accommodating, and kind host. The apartment is spotless, comfortable, and in a prime location: a 15-20 minute walk from any major site in the city. The roof desk with great views of Mont Royal is an added plus! Eric responded almost immediately to all of my messages making check in and check out seamless. I cannot recommend Eric more highly!","10"
"Eric was amazing! As soon as I arrived, he contacted me to give me recommendations of the area. The place was very clean and comfortable. Great location, near Place des Arts.","10"
"Great value for money apartment. Public transport connections to all neighbourhoods very easy, or walkable if you are energetic. Number of local supermarkets and some very good eating place within striking distance. Our trip was a very pleasant experience.","10"
"Awesome location! Steps away from the train and from one of the public BIXI bike docks. Close to a bunch of restaurants and bars, lots of nightlife in the area. My girlfriend and I spent a week here and it worked out perfect for a simple smaller place. Would recommend.","10"
"Nice, quiet, well-furnished studio, well-equipped kitchen, very convenient location, friendly and responsive host, and a wonderful stay","10"
"The space is very clean, well located very closed of metro station, the infrastructure is excellent, quit, easy communication, even during the raining days it is easy to move and find anything that you need
The apartment has e everything you need, I strong recommend Eric’s apartment","10"
"I would have given this property 5 stars, expect for the noise factor due to the Jazz Fest. So like 11 out of the 12 months of the year 5 stars. I was in Montreal for school / work, so I needed to spend time studying, which proved to be difficult as the music from thr festival last until 1:00 am each and every day. 

Also, the a/c broke, but since i was there during the longest heat wave Montreal has ever experienced, a broken a/c was almost imminent. The city’s whole cooling system must have been and still is stressed to the maximum. The day I left Montreal, the temperature is the apartment was 83 degrees. 

I had to leave Montreal very early due to a serious medical emergency at home. My father is gravely ill, had a cardiac arrest and is still a patient in the ICU. So it’s been stressful. Eric was VERY helpful during this difficult situation, and helped me check out immediately. 

The apartment itself was great and clean. Loved the location. 

Thank you","10"
"My stay at the apartment was good. The location was perfect for walking to the office and grocery store, as well as right next door to all the festivals going on that week! The place was clean and comfortable. The main AC was not working at the time, but a small portable unit was brought in and it kept the place comfortable.  It's a great little downtown location and the rooftop patio is a cool bonus!","10"
"The apartment is in a great location, close to many restaurants and festivals. Eric is a very attentive host and responded quickly to any questions/concerns that we had.  The place is clean and comfortable. The rooftop patio is wonderful to enjoy the views in the evening!  I would definitely stay here again if I returned to Montreal ","10"
"We had a great time staying at Eric’s. It is in a great location and is the perfect size for two people. The roof top patio is a giant plus and has a nice view of La Croix du Mont Royal. Eric responded promptly to any questions, and check in and check out were a breeze. We would love to stay here again. ","10"
"Excelente apartamento. Tem tudo o que voce precisa. Metro e onibus só atravessar a rua. Localizacao muito boa. Tem um terraço com uma bela vista pra apreciar. E o Eric é comunicativo e sempre disposto a ajudar.  Recomendo.","10"

"Nice studio. Great downtown location! Thanks Eric!","10"
"Staying here was a great experience! Marie-Andree gave us a good orientation when we first got there and I was really happy that we had everything we needed from the get go - fresh towels, bedding, kitchen supplies, mini toiletries in the bathroom - and the place was spotless! It was like staying at a nice hotel. Great location close to some nice bars and restos, and Marie-Andree was lovely, and responsive right to the end. Very happy to have been the first guests here - hope many more get to enjoy the space :) 
","9"
"We miss Montreal already. We had such a great time there. The flat is divine. Marie-Andree and Stephane were really welcoming (and great at helping us out before and during our stay with all our questions) and the location -- The Plateau -- is superb. Lots of cute restaurants and cafes on Rue Laurier, a minute away, and more shopping and bars on Rue Mont Royal, a 10 minute walk. We couldn't have hoped for more. Thanks to Marie-Andree and Stephane for being so kind and putting so much thought into your flat. We hope to see you again soon!","9"
"We had a fantastic stay in this beautiful apartment on the Plateau. The location can't be beat, only steps away from the charming, tree-lined rue Laurier chock full of great cafés, restaurants, bakeries & grocery stores. The apartment was spotless and had everything that we could need including a great & calm back balcony spot for a nice BBQ and glass of wine (or two) at the end of the day. Thanks Marie-Andrée & Stéphane, we will definitely return again.","9"
"Marie-Andrée a été une hôte super accueillante et disponible! La facilité de communication a d'ailleurs été très appréciée. L'appartement, quant à lui, était impeccable, joli et répondait à toutes nos attentes. Il se situe dans un charmant quartier près de nombreux commerces et cafés. Nous regrettons seulement avoir manqué de temps pour profiter des environs et du BBQ qui était à notre disposition! Mes amis et moi sommes reconnaissants pour votre accueil. Au plaisir! :)","9"
"This apartment was truly charming and perfect for our recent 3 night stay in Montreal.  My teen daughter, her two friends and I all loved it.  It was spotlessly clean, decorated in a very welcoming, comfortable way, and had everything we needed for our stay.  The kitchen is so pleasant with large windows and high ceilings, perfect to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning.  The back patio was equally inviting and we enjoyed eating breakfast and dinner there.  The pictures accurately show the apartment but can't quite do it full justice.  The neighborhood also won us over - it is a beautiful  residential street - lots of trees, easy parking (but pay attention to certain sections requiring a residential sticker), and very safe.  Rue Laurier is a 2 minute walk and full of cafes, restaurants, a grocery store, and cute shops.  The metro is about 10 minutes away by foot but a nice walk along Laurier and past the park.  We took advantage of the Bixi bikes at the corner of the block (2 minutes away) and loved exploring the city by bike - made very easy with the bike lanes and attention to cyclists all throughout the city.  Marie-Andree and Stephane could not have been nicer in welcoming us to Montreal and to the apartment.  They were quick to respond to emails before our arrival and waiting to meet us when we arrived - even an hour late after a long delay at the US/Canadian border.  We had to get right back out the door for an event and they were very helpful with metro directions.  It is very nice having them living right downstairs - very convenient if there were any questions.  The next day I texted asking if it was a good time to ask for advice on some sightseeing.  They were out to lunch but sent Marie-Andree's brother over to answer my questions and provide great recommendations.  There was fresh fruit, milk, butter and condiments in the refrigerator, and delicious coffee - very thoughtful and particularly helpful as we didn't have to go to the store right away and were able to enjoy our first morning with the food we brought and what they left for us.  All in all, we loved staying here, highly recommend it and hope to come back to Montreal and stay here again.  Our only complaint was that we couldn't stay another day or two!  Thank you Marie-Andree and Stephane!","9"
"We booked the place at the last minute without any problems and the apartment ready by the time it got there. It was very clean and exactly as it looks in the pictures. It was great.","9"

"We got to stay in this beautiful apartment over the weekend and had absolutely nothing to complain about! The place was just as described, and Marie and Stéphane were great hosts. Whenever we get a chance to come back to Montreal, this will be our go-to place for accommodation! Merci beaucoup!","9"
"2 adults and 1 child visited Montreal in summer for 2 days. We enoyed the city and the nice appartment. It was near by downtown (15 min. to walk to the next subway station and with the subway 10 min.) The Rue manquette was very charming and close by we could use the restaurants, supermarket...all what we needed. We met only Stephane,  he was a very good host and he was very friendly. Marie et Stephane answered every questions per sms...thank you very much. They helped us everytime. The appartment was cozy and adequate for the price. May be the balkony were a little bit to small for us.
We recommended Marie et Stephane as good host. Thanks for all. 
","9"
"A wonderful couple who made us feel welcome.  Great communication via email prior to visit (we were coming from US and would not have the ability to make phone calls or access email once we crossed the border).  Beautiful space with deck access.  Fully equipped kitchen, though there were so many great restaurants 2 blocks away that we never cooked!","9"
"Marie and Stephane were such wonderful hosts. They were very accommodating, warm, communicative and responsive. We traveled with two teens who  thought too that the apartment was perfect - comfortable, very clean and ideally located. Short  walk to several great restaurants, boutiques and about ten mins to the metro. Pleasant walk to hip shopping strips and cafes. We loved exploring Montreal and will definitely be back. Thanks to our hosts who played a part in making this visit quite memorable....","9"
"The neighbourhood is very quaint and pleasant, its on a nice private street and the apartment itself is very tidy and clean. I did not meet the host but they were quick to answer any questions via the messages application on the airbnb app. 
The only complaint we really had was that the pull out couch was not very easy to unfold into a bed. Also, the lock for the door is hard to close and lock secure before leaving. 
Other than that, the place is nice and good for four people (once you unfold the bed of course). ","9"
"Bon séjour à Montréal!
L'appartement est confortable et fonctionnel.
Tout ce dont on pouvait avoir besoin y était!
Quartier typique et très agréable!
Marie André et Stéphane été présent dès que nous avions besoin!
Seul petit bémol : il manque un ventilateur ( très chaud au mois de juillet)
","9"
"The apartment was every bit as beautiful as advertised. The location was fantastic, the neighbourhood was gorgeous, and the people were lovely. We were greeted promptly and with open arms and had a wonderful time. Thanks for having us!","9"
"Can't say enough wonderful things about this little gem.  Great location, very clean and comfortable, and a nice bed :)  We have a little one and it was perfect for the three of us.  Marie and Stephane were gracious and available if we needed anything.  Five star!","9"
"Stéphane was there to greet us when we arrived, and gave us a brief tour of the apartment. He was super friendly, and gave us restaurant recommendations when we asked. The place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. It is very clean and bright. The bathroom is tiny but modern with everything you need. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms cozy.
I would definitely stay there again whenever I get back to Montreal.","9"
"The apartment is very clean and well furnished and completely met our needs. The location is convenient, and the neighbourhood is very pleasant, quiet and safe, with many conveniences.

 We would not hesitate to return.","9"
"Superbe appartement dans un quartier très agréable. Marie-Andrée et Stéphane ont été très accommodants et accueillants. Les chambres étaient un peu chaudes mais j'ai visité Montréal pendant une vague de chaleur inhabituelle, ce n'est donc pas imputable aux hôtes ... qui plus est Marie-Andrée et Stéphane ont prévu d'ajouter un ventilateur à l'avenir.
En résumé, je recommande !","9"
"Nous avons été accueillis chaleureusement par Marie-Andrée. L'appartement est très joli et fonctionnel avec une literie de bonne qualité. Le quartier est très sympa, calme, avec un parc à proximité.","9"

Very friendly, easygoing hosts. 
Would definitely stay here again. ","9"
"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans cet appartement conforme à la description et aux photos, dans un quartier calme et en même temps proche de toutes les commodités (restaurants, métro, etc...)
Marie-Andrée et Stéphane ont été des hôtes très discrets et en même temps très disponibles lorsque nous en avons eu besoin.

"Marie-Andrée et Stéphanie ont été très sympathique!  Ils nous ont bien accueilli, et leur appartement est vraiment super, l'étiquetage aux photos! 
Je recommande vivement! ","9"
"Appartement très agréable et typiquement Montréalais.Bien situé sur le Plateau ,5mn du bus et 10mn du métro Laurier dans une rue calme  avec de nombreux commerces et restos à proximité .
Correspond tout à fait au descriptif du site avec une salle de bain petite (surtout le lavabo ) , mais très fonctionnelle .Beau balcon ensoleillé l l'apm.
Une adresse à retenir ; nous risquons d'y revenir bientôt !","9"
"Stéphane et Marie-Andrée nous ont chaleureusement accueillis pour notre voyage de dernière minute à Montréal. Ils étaient super réactifs et on ne manquait rien. L'appartement était très bien situé et propre... encore mieux que sur les photos.

La seule chose c'est que nous aurions préféré rester plus longtemps !","9"
"We stayed here just before the holidays and had a great experience. Everything was as described and although we didn't get much of a chance to chat with Stephane, he was very friendly and inviting. The location is great. Lots of restaurants and bakeries near by as well as a grocery store. The place was very clean and although the bathroom is small, it was totally functional and the shower had great pressure! Overall would stay here again and would definitely recommend to others.","9"
"The apartment and the neighborhood was wonderful; everything we needed inside and a good selection of restaurants and shops nearby including a grocery shop.","9"
"Our stay at the apartment of Marie-Andrée and Stéphane was perfect. The place was clean and simple but with just enough to make it convenient and give it character. The street is quiet and the neighbourhood charming. It is a great location if you want to be close to the Plateau, Mile-End and Parc Lafontaine but slightly off the main streets. There are several great restaurants and shops within an easy walk and convenient to the metro. I would definitely stay again.","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 92 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Thank you! Everything was great. we loved the space - very comfortable and charming. Thank you also for the two fans to keep us cool.","9"
"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Marie-André et Stéphane. Très bel appartement. Tout est à proximité du logement  (supermarché, métro, restaurant, parc) ce qui est fort appréciable! Le quartier est super! nous l'avons beaucoup apprécié! 
Nous recommandons sans hésitation cet appartement. 
","9"
"Super quartier, appart typique, accueil chaleureux... Que demander de mieux pour notre arrivée au Canada! L'appartement est super, tout à disposition, le barbecue est particulièrement appréciable, beaucoup de charme et un accueil très chouette! On recommande!!","9"
"L'appartement est très bien situé à 10 min de la station laurier et à proximité de tous les commerces. La rue est calme. Le logement pour 4 personnes est suffisamment grand et  pratique et a beaucoup de charme. Niveau rapport qualité prix c'est le top je recommande vivement ce logement, merci aux propriétaires. ","9"
"Marie-Andrée and Stéphane emailed us to let us know our apartment was no longer available for the days booked but they offered us another for the same price to compensate for the inconvenience. Although we did not stay in the apartment pictured, I will still review our experience. Our arrival time ended up being a bit later than originally planned however it didn't end up being an issue and Stéphane was very flexible with meet times. We met Stéphane at the apartment at arrival and he gave us a tour and the keys. The apartment was absolutely gorgeous and it was in a great location. Free parking on the street. The only negative was it was very warm inside and because of the big windows, super sunny days and lack of air conditioning it made it harder to cool down the apartment, however they did have multiple fans throughout the apartment. They were readily available to answer any questions and were easy to contact. Would definitely recommended staying in one of Marie-Andrée and Stéphane 's apartments! Would stay there again.","9"
"Our hosts were fantastic, the place was spacious, clean and we'll kept. Definitely hoping to stay there again!","9"
"The hosts were easy to communicate with and were happy to provide suggestions. The only complaint we had was some essential amenities were not available, like toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent, and soap. Our stay would have been great if those were provided. ","9"
"Great well equiped apartment. It looks exactly as it is in the pictures. Grreat location. The apartment is perfect for a couple. Everything reachable in a walking distance. Lovely neighborhood.","9"
"Beautiful spot. Lots of character in a nice area. Quaint and comfortable. All the amenities available; (shampoo, conditioner, toiletries, towels, etc.) a definite 10/10!","9"
"Communication pre-arrival was great. We let Marie-Andree and Stephane know we would be arriving later than we originally thought; they would be out, so left a key inside.  Easy.  We found the neighborhood beautiful, and location good.  Parking was easy.  Stephane recommended a great Sushi restaurant (Tri Express) on the corner.  The apartment itself was, for the most part, comfortable. The bedroom, the bed. Plenty of closet space, hangers, surface space to put stuff. Cute kitchen. Cute shared deck with grill (we didn't use it, however). Fans were a welcome thing as it was warm and humid during much of our stay.  What wasn't expected was the  uncomfortable sofa bed: you could feel the bars of the frame whether sitting or sleeping, and the noise late at night from the very heavy-footed upstairs neighbors.  If you are a light sleeper you may also find this disruptive.  Also, the apartment was was very clean, except for the floors which seemed not to have been washed in a while which we noticed from walking barefoot.  I don't like ending on a negative note, so I'll close by saying the hosts were friendly, and responsive. ","9"
"This is a fantastic apartment in a great area. It's a quick 15-minute walk to the metro, and there are lots of great restaurants and stores nearby. The apartment is in an older building with lots of historical details, including gorgeous hardwood floors. The bathroom, while small, is well appointed, and the kitchen is excellent. We really enjoyed the outside deck area for breakfast.  The host family lives right downstairs was a joy to deal with. Truly one of our best rental experiences. Very highly recommended!","9"
"Logement propre et spacieux pour 2, un peu sombre. Literie confortable. Un peu bruyant car beaucoup de travaux dans le quartier en ce moment. Mobilier un peu vieillissant, vaisselle disparate et bbq brisé, dommage... mais bien dans l'ensemble et confortable.","9"
"Great experience! Good location, a bit of a walk from the metro but close to bike share and bus. Near cute restuarants, a beautiful park, walking distance to bars. Apartment was clean and VERY well equipped. Only issue was the futon in the living room is pretty uncomfortable (especially for two adults), but would still very much recommend. Easy street parking. We never met the hosts but communication was easy. :)","9"
"Apparemment très bien situé au calme. Hôte très sympathique. Attention au stationnement en bas du logement (se renseigner auprès de l'hôte au préalable).","9"
"L'appartement est très joli, spacieux et propre, dans un quartier très agréable, proche des commerces, restaurants et du parc Laurier. Stéphane est un hôte très accueillant. Nous avons passé un séjour parfait !","9"
"Really great space! Awesome kitchen and balcony with BBQ. Great location, close to the metro and cute neighbour with restaurants and grocery store. Perfect stay and the hosts were very accommodating! Thank-you!","9"
"Appartement agréable, comme sur l'annonce. Un peu petit pour 4 mais pour les vacances on s'adapte. Propriétaire très sympa et arrangeant.  Merci Stephane.","9"
"A great flat in a nice, walkable neighbourhood with good restaurants and every convenience, including a bike share at the end of the street. Our hosts were responsive and available to show us the flat's features. We had a brief but comfortable stay and we would not hesitate to rent the flat again.","9"
"Le logement de Marie et Stéphane est très confortable, propre et bien équipé. Il est idéalement situé, dans un quartier très calme, mais près de commerces et de l'animation de la rue Mont Royal. Il est très facile de se déplacer à pied pour découvrir Montréal car les bus et métro sont à proximité (la station Laurier est à 10 mn à pied). Stéphane m'a accueillie à mon arrivée et m'a présenté le logement ainsi que les équipements. Marie et Stéphane habitent au rez-de-chaussée, et sont donc facilement joignables si besoin. J'ai passé un excellent séjour et recommande ce logement.","9"
"Great location and neighbourhood! Response rate is fast and efficient.","9"
"Excellent bed, very quiet and exceptionally located.","9"
"À notre arrivée, Stéphane était absent, mais avait convenu d'un endroit pour que nous récupérions la clé. Il est venu nous rejoindre par la suite et s'est assuré que nous manquions de rien. Il a été très accueillant et la communication a été facile à toutes les étapes de la réservation. 

L'emplacement est très bucolique, avec de belles rues pleines d'arbres et de jolies ruelles. Il y a plusieurs commerces et une épicerie à proximité et il est très agréable de se promener dans le quartier en famille. Tout près du parc Laurier où des installations sont présentes pour les jeunes enfants. 

Il manque un peu d'espace dans la cuisine pour y manger à 4, mais l'endroit est très chaleureux et accueillant. Nous avons deux enfants de moins de 4 ans et tout était bien adapté: nous n'avions pas à rendre l'endroit ""kid-proof"". Il y a aussi de jeunes enfants dans le voisinage, ce qui leur a tenu compagnie. Les autres locataires du bloc sont très calmes et silencieux, aucun problème de ce côté. Nous avons été en mesure de nous stationner à même la rue et avons fait nos déplacements en métro. 

En bref, ce fut une très belle expérience et je recommande chaudement le logement de Marie-Andrée et Stéphane!","9"
"Thank you for the great stay at your place. We loved the apartment and the location was fantastic. The hosts were easy to communicate with and prompt to respond to requests.

"This was our first long-term stay and it couldn't have been a better experience. The apartment, the neighborhood, and the hospitality of our hosts were all far above and beyond. We would not hesitate to suggest this apartment to anyone else. A++++. ","9"
"I stayed in this place for 2 months (!) and it was the perfect home away from home. The best location in Montreal, great neighborhood with the trendiest cafe's and restaurants. Good transportation and close to many cultural places. The apartment is quiet and green, well designed and full of light. It was a wonderful experience I would recommend to anyone.","9"
"This is a beautiful space in an excellent neighbourhood. The hosts were extremely quick to respond and very accommodating to requests. Within a few hours they let me check in early due to a change in travel plans. The hosts gave excellent tips and are located beside a major street with quaint coffee shops, restaurants, and boutiques. There was no A/C so it got very hot (despite the use of fans) but there are blinds that can be closed to help keep the space cooler. Thanks so much for having us! ","9"
"Marie and Stéphane are great hosts . They made us feel like we were in our own home . The location of the place is great . It is close to parks like la Fontaine and sir Wilfred where my 2 year old son loved to play. The Laurier metro station is 15 minutes walking distance . Many Bus stops are 2-5 minutes walking distance . We loved our stay here . The place is one of the best place to visit Montreal . Thanks for every thing","9"
"Excellent pour ceux qui veulent s'immerger dans l'ambiance du Plateau à Montréal!","9"
"Great place with an even greater host! Carlos was very thorough in making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The apartment is in a wonderful location. It's the 2nd house up from the water on a quiet street. Bike paths following the water are a wonderful place to run, bike and walk. The apartment has a newly renovated kitchen & bathroom. The kitchen has great quality pots & pans, a drip coffee maker and a Krups pump espresso machine for us caffeine addicts. The wall AC unit was great and will be very useful in the summer months. The non-renovated floors are a bit creaky, giving you an authentic Montreal feel.  All in all a wonderful place with a wonderful host.","10"
"Carlos is an excellent host and he did everything to make you feel comfortable.","10"
"i loved the apartment everything was clean and in its place. The neighborhood is great, very nice neighbors and you feel safe. Carlos was a great host and there to answer your questions when you needed him to find you way around. thank you so much Carlos...","10"
"Our accommodation on Clemenceau was exactly as described and as pictured in the photographs. The apartment was very, very clean, and incredibly quiet. The pictures do not do the kitchen and bathroom justice; they were both beautifully renovated. The kitchen was well equipped. We we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  The location was excellent for anyone who enjoys cycling or walking; only steps from the  riverfront trail and bird sanctuary. There is a public swimming pool within walking distance that is very cool.   Although the apartment is not located in the heart of Montreal, there is a bus stop a few minutes away with a short ride to the Metro (subway) to take you downtown. Getting to the heart of Montreal is easy by car. There was ample street parking.  Our host, Carlos was downstairs and was very amenable.  We would recommend this accommodation. ","10"
"The house is exactly as advertised, in my opinion this is a unique house. The house combines,  historic charm - Wood floors and antique cupboards etc,  and upgraded kitchen and bathroom, which are absolutely wonderful. 

The Location of the house is also great, it is right next to st Lawrence river, which is also perk. 

 Ample parking is available on the street. 

Had a great stay, would recommend to friends and family. 


","10"
"Thank you so much to Carlos for making our experience to Montreal so great. My Kids love his place and it is just across the street for a Beautiful park. we rent bikes and enjoyed the sun.

The apartment is bright, has an eclectic mix of antique-style furniture and a very comfy beds. it is roomy and well-stocked. Kitchen & Bathroom is recently upgraded and real brand new.

Carlos was quick to respond to all my messages & very helpful. Really we didn't need much during the stay as just about everything was ready and available.

It was a pleasure to stay in his place and I would certainly come back. Would definitely recommend!

"Carlos's apartment is one of my best airbnb experience ever.  There are two spacious bedrooms with comfy beds and one queen- sofa bed, which was better than described.  It's very very clean and well maintenance.The kitchen and bathroom is very nice and clean. The plus  is surrounding area is very nice during the summer time. Carlos was very responsive and helpful.

"This is a beautiful and spacious apartment with brand new kitchen and bathroom. If you have a car it is the perfect location as it is close to a beautiful  river, to a mall, to a supermarket and to the subway station. It is a very quiet and family oriented area. You leave your car at the subway station and in 15 min you are downtown, Montreal. We loved the convenience.","10"
"My husband and I stayed here for about a week while kayaking in the lachine rapids.  It was an amazing stay.  The apartment was spacious and clean.  The location was beyond perfect.  After a day of surfing we could simply take out and walk across the street to the house.  This is probably one of the best air bnb listings for Montreal.  Carlos was responsive, accommodating and super nice.","10"
"This is the perfect place to stay in Montreal.  Lovely, well-appointed apartment, very clean & comfortable in a quiet neighborhood by the river.  Carlos is the perfect host - he made sure everything was OK when we arrived and let us know he was readily available if we needed anything.  Flexible check in/out made this a completely stress-free experience for our family.","10"
"This House is very nice on a good location. 15 mins driving to downtown. It is very clean. Carlos is very kind and quick to my question. He had prepared everything for living. I had a pleasant time in this house. I hope to reserve again for my next trip in Montreal and also recommend it to my friends","10"
"Carlos was a caring and welcoming host. He was available in person, by phone or e-mail in case we needed anything.  The apartment was a gem. It was a wonderful blend of the old and the new. The kitchen and bathroom were modern; both were very well-equipped. The in-heat flooring was great. We loved the view of the river and park from the front balcony and living room window.  The apartment is away from the hustle and bustle of downtown  Montreal and is in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. We were impressed by how clean the apartment  was. It was spotlessly clean; everything, everywhere. My family  loved the apartment and we would  recommend  it and Carlos  highly.","10"

The neighborhood is clean, beautiful and accessible for walking, running and biking. We wish we could have had a longer stay!","10"
"We had a terrific 2-night stay in Carlos' apartment.  There's a terrific park across the street that follows the river, and it's near Metro stations to help transport you around the City without driving.  With all the construction going on, it was great to take buses and the Metro (on a day pass).  Carlos' place is well-equipped with all that you'll need, and communication with him was excellent.  A great ""home away from home""!","10"
"Carlos é stato davvero un super host! 
Ho passato due settimane nel suo fantastico appartamento insieme ad una mia amica e non potrebbe essere andata meglio di così!
Carlos é stato davvero disponibile per ogni tipo di problema e soprattutto molto gentile con noi.
Ci ha consigliato dove acquistare buona parte delle cose per la casa è come muoverci per la cittá, cosa molto semplice dal suo appartamento.
La casa é in un quartiere residenziale molto tranquillo, ma in 30 minuti con autobus e metro si arriva in centro dove si trova di tutto.
Consiglio a tutti!","10"
"Carlos est un hôte attentif et réactif. Il nous a contacté avant le séjour pour nous donner toutes les indications facilitant notre arrivée.
Son appartement est situé dans une zone résidentielle très agréable, à 100 m d'une magnifique promenade sur les rives du Saint Laurent.
L'appartement est joli, bien agencé et bien décoré, la cuisine est magnifique et super bien équipée. L' A/C dans la cuisine est suffisamment puissant pour rafraichir tout le logement.
Nous n'avons pas rencontré Carlos mais il s'est tenu à notre disposition à tout moment pendant notre séjour un peu trop court.
Une belle découverte, merci Carlos.

The host also provided 2 more portable A/Cs. Although they were noisy but helped a lot .","10"
"Carlos is an extremely friendly and helpful host, he gave us lots of informations and he helped us in a bag delay problem. The flat is very clean and full of every furniture you need.

Apt itself is spacious, two bedrooms and like two dining rooms (or one but just huge).
Kitchen is fully equiped and even more... heated floore is awesome!
Apt's located in peacefull, calm area. Very close to water and parks. 2 minutes to the bus stop. But better consider this apt with a car if you want to go to downtown every day. 
We enjoyed our staying there. Thank you Carlos!","10"
"Carlos is a wonderful host and he communicates really well. His condo is clean and had fully stocked kitchen and located in wonderful residential area with easy access to public park and river.

"A clean cosy apartment and Carlos is an ideal host - responsive, cordial and helpful.  He helped us by providing Metro cards for our use which was most appreciated - the apartment is a few bus stops from a Metro station so the cards enabled us to use public transport and the underground. The apartment is   warm, comfortable and 200 yards from the river.","10"
"The place is great and exactly as described. Nice green space basically across the street and close to most amenities. Taking public transit downtown was a breeze. Carlos was extremely quick responding to inquiries. Would not hesitate to stay here again. Thanks Carlos!","10"
"We spent 2 nights at Carlos' nice apartment, and took full advantage of all the unusual highlights that the neighborhood offers: jogging along the Lachine rapids, cycling to Montreal downtown using the Bixi bikes, dancing at the public dance floor at the St Lorence river. Carlos is very welcoming and made our stay comfortable. The apartment is exactly as described, very clean and convenient. For a special Montreal experience by bike this is the ideal place to stay.","10"

"Excellent séjour à Montréal en grande partie grâce à l’appartement de Carlos. Plusieurs points à souligner : 1) bien situé, juste au bord de la rivière Saint Lawrence avec plein d’activités dans la verdure, en complément d’un paysage à la fois reposant et pittoresque;  2) déco très agréable et équipement de la cuisine très complet et il y a tout ce qu’il faut dans la SDB comme à la maision; 3) prise USB pour la recharge, très appréciée par les visiteurs français (surtout par ceux sans adaptateur de prise de courant); 4) clim disponible dans chaque pièce, incontournable pendant la canicule ; 5) facilité de transport en commun, bus 58 et ensuite métro à proximité ; 6) il est également simple de se garer dans la rue où se situe l’appartement et last but not least la réactivité et la disponibilité de l’hôte. On le recommande définitivement !","10"

"We had a great time staying at Carlos’s place - the property is just as advertised & shown in the photos. 
It is very close to the riverside where you can walk or cycle. The included bikes are great & we used them to cycle in to the old town one day - it took around 45 mins but it was a very leisurely cycle. There is also public transport very near by & I would definitely recommend leaving the car at the house.

C'était notre première expérience avec Airbnb alors on ne savait pas trop à quoi s'attendre. Nous avons aimé les petits détails rajoutés comme le journal édition Grand Prix sur la table à notre arrivée (la raison de notre visite). Très belle endroit que je recommande à tous! :)","10"
"L'endroit est parfait. Si vous cherchez la vie trépidante de Montréal, il faudra sauter dans le taxi, prendre un bixi (juste à côté) où prendre le métro...à 5 minutes de marche.

C'est propre et près des services. Parfait.","10"

"Philippe's place is amazing. It is clean, comfortable, quiet, well-appointed....I could just go on. I think this is the first location I've stayed at which has everything covered. It's in a quiet area of the city, about a 5 minute walk from the Joliette metro station. Philippe was hospitable and helpful. This will be my first choice if I need a place to stay in Montreal again.","10"
"Always a pleasure to stay at Philippe's.","10"
"We really enjoyed our stay at Philippe's apartment - La maison aux raisins.  It was our first Airbnb experience so we were not sure what to expect.  Philippe was great to deal with.  He always responded quickly and even though French is his first language we had no problems communicating in English.
This apartment is about a 10 minute walk from two metro stations (Pie IX and Joliette) and if you have luggage you can take a bus to/from the metro station (the metro is down the hill from this house), the bus stop is right around the corner from the house.  When we arrived Philippe greeted us with the keys and gave us a tour of the apartment.  He thoughtfully had a small snack on the table for us and showed us lots of things he set aside  to help us out on our trip such as maps of the city and a booklet with information to help us find grocery stores, malls, etc.  
The apartment was cosy with lots of  things to make us feel welcome.  The kitchen was well equipped, although we mostly ate out enjoying the great food in Montreal.  There is lots of room in the fridge and appliances to make meals or reheat leftovers.  The bathroom was very clean and modern.  There is a nice sized storage area to keep empty suitcases and bags.  Everywhere we looked in the apartment we found things set out to make our stay a good one - there was a candy jar, coffee, tea, jams, bread in the freezer, a first aid kit, sewing kit and a laundry room.  There was even local art on the walls and lots of decorations around the place to make us feel at home.
I have nothing to compare this experience to other than hotel stays but both my wife and I were very impressed with both Philippe and Marie and the apartment.  If we are ever back in Montreal I will be sure to check the availability of La maison aux raisins.","10"
"Excellent séjour, comme à chaque fois!","10"
"Super appartement ! en demi sous sol donc éclairé mais quand même frais, très propre et bien équipé. dès notre arrivée nous avons très bien été reçu par Philippe qui avait laisser des muffins pour nous dans la cuisine. Le quartier est très calme, en face d'un agréable petit parc. Les hôtes sont extrêmement gentils et ont pleins de petites attentions très appréciées ! ","10"
"This listing did not disappoint.  It was well appointed, clean, and Philippe goes above and beyond to make your stay very comfortable.  Would recommend this Airbnb without hesitation!","10"
"Philip was a wonderful host. He provided many thoughtful touches like a binder with all the info you need about the place as well as visiting Montreal. Like many of the other reviews, he provided a nice snack as a welcome. The venue is clean and stylish with all the amenities you could ever need to live on comfort. It's close to main transportation, and will get you to downtown within half an hour. I would definitely stay here again for future trips to Montreal ","10"
"Très joli appartement, agréable et propre. Peu lumineux car au sous-sol mais ça ne nous a posé aucun souci !","10"
"My husband and I spent a long weekend in Montreal for my birthday. We found Philippe's place to be a wonderful value for the money and it was a very comfortable apartment. It's a basement level unit with Philippe living right upstairs so the host is always conveniently nearby. We found that he responded to messages quickly.  We met him during check-in when he showed the apartment to us and pointed out where we can find items we may need.  He gave us the keys, showed us how to lock the doors and walked us through how to park. He was very pleasant. There were many thoughtful items left for us: a couple muffins for breakfast, water, juice and beer in the fridge, plenty of tea in the cupboard. The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans, a variety of dishes, etc. The mattress was firm and while I like a softer mattress (my husband prefers one that is firm!) I found that I woke up well rested and comfortable.

We found the location of the apartment to be absolutely wonderful.  It was a short walk (about 5 mins) to the Biodome, Botanical Gardens and Pie IX metro station. The apartment is located on a wonderfully quiet residential street and we felt very safe leaving our car parked on the street. Near the apartment is a grocery store as well as 3 local parks that were beautiful to walk through. We couldn't have been happier with the location of this space. ","10"
"A wonderful place with everything needed to stay a couple of days or longer. I‘ll be back soon","10"
"Bien situé avec tout l'équipement nécessaire et plus.  Merci.","10"
"This was our first Airbnb and it was wonderful! The apartment was beautiful, apparently new, and well-equipped, on a quiet street. Philippe went far beyond what we could have expected in helping us. When we were having trouble finding our way from the airport, he came and picked us up at the Metro. He was available every time we needed any help planning what we would do in Montreal. 

The most fascinating place we visited turned out to be the botanical garden, unlike any we’ve seen anywhere else, and the big chain of greenhouses with plants from around the world and information about them. They are a short walk from Philippe’s house, as is the Metro. There's a bus to a different Metro station that stops even closer to his house but we didn't use it.

Altogether, Montreal was a great vacation for us. The only downside was flight delays in both directions, to and from Boston. We could have gotten there much faster and easier by car, which is how we will go if we have a chance for a second trip.","10"
"This was our third trip to Montreal since our son and daughter-in-law got married, and Philippe'S home will be our go to from now on. Everything about the place made us feel like we had found a rare gem.  From the high end finishes in the kitchen and bathroom, to the linens and towels, and the yummy muffins and other thoughtful touches.  Philippe had a quick response to any question or need we had and truly made us feel welcome in his home.","10"
"A hidden gem in the AirBnB landscape! I’ll be back soon","10"
"We really enjoyed Leyla's apartment! It's spacious and lies right in the heart of Montreal, has a nice view and the pool and fitness room are great. The apartment was clean and everything went smooth and uncomplicated! Thank you!","8"

"Jasmine and her roommate were extremely courteous and helpful.  They are friendly and super chill. Their place is clean and tidy. Comfortable and sunny. The location of their apartment is on a very charming and quiet street. The neighborhood they reside at is also amazing and is close to so many things. It's a walker's paradise. And if you like cats, there's a cat cafe is right across the street.","10"
"Jasmine and An-Julie made us feel very welcome and they were very hospitable. Their home was even nicer than the photos. Everything was as they described. The best part about our stay was the amazing location. I know doing air b&b was only a short term plan given their upcoming move, but if they ever do air b&b again in the future, I would  recommend them as hosts.","10"

"Lovely large airy apartment in a very good part of Montreal. Good transport connections. Everything nearby on Monkland, including a good coffee shop. Barbecue and back deck directly off kitchen so very pleasant. Initially not as clean as we are used to with air B and B, but Kristin sorted this as soon as we raised it sending the cleaning company, and was in touch throughout to check that things were Ok. There is a problem with the second bedroom window, which lacks an insect screen, a necessity particularly in summer. The 2 double bedrooms are fine, but the sofa/bed is not comfortable. Subject to these points being fixed, we recommend this.","8"
"Emilie & her roommate Olivia were amazing hosts who made me feel comfortable from the frist minute I arrived. The Apartment is located in a very Nice area with lots of Cafés and Shops. A Metro stop and a grocery store Are close by. They both gave me really good tips on where to go to & i knew I could ask them about everything I needed to Know for my stay! I totally recommend their Place with the beautiful backyard Terrasse!!","9"
"Très bel accueil, chaleureux et plein de vie. Super appartement avec une incroyable terrasse en pleine ville. Très bien situé (à 2 minutes de la station Mont Royal) avec une rue pleine de vie, de restos et de magasins. Emilie et Olivia sont deux jeunes étudiantes qui aiment parler et qui sont toujours partantes pour passer du bon temps. Que du plaisir! 
","9"
"Absolutely satisfied with my stay!! Look no further. This is the place to stay in Montreal!!! Emilie and Olivia are the friendliest, most welcoming hostesses you will find! I stayed with them for 11 days and it was the best decision I could have made. They are so kind, resourceful and well informed about every place in the city. Their pride and love for Montreal is expressed elegantly in every corner of their home. They truly make every accommodation possible and enjoyable  with impeccable taste and exceptional attention to detail. The room and bed are extremely comfortable and the closet space generous. Their spacious apartment is conveniently located near any available mode of transportation in the city within a city block's distance. It's prime  location in ""le plateau"" places you at the heart of one of the most exciting neighborhoods in the entire city with  restaurants, cafes and entertainment all around where you can enjoy delicious food, beer and great live music. The back terrace is a true refuge for when you want to kick back, enjoy the good weather and relax after a long day going about town. If you wish to travel hassle-free, meet cool people and truly enjoy  Montreal, stay here.","9"

L appartement a du charme, est bien équipé, et dispose d un cour extérieure. La rue est tres calme tout en étant à proximité d un quartier sympa et animé (restos, boutiques....) excellente adresse pour un séjour à Montréal.","10"
"Nous avons passé un superbe séjour Montréalais, en grande partie grâce à la situation idéale de l'appartement (une petite maison en réalité car nous avions un jardinet). Nous pouvions tout faire à pied et surtout profiter de l'animation sans égale du Plateau. Accueil extrêmement chaleureux de Martine, appartement très bien équipé, nous ne manquions de rien et nous sentions chez nous. Notre plus belle expérience Air BnB à ce jour. Nous recommandons sans aucune hésitation. Merci beaucoup. ","10"
"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour (6 jours fin aout début septembre 2015), dans le charmant appartement de Richard. Idéalement situé dans le quartier résidentiel de Montroyal et dans une rue très calme, mais également jouxtant le centre ville et le quartier latin, cet appartement a tous les avantages que l'on peut espérer : spacieux, arrangé avec beaucoup de gout et de personnalité, tous les équipements possibles pour la cuisine et le confort, avec des chambres très calmes, un petit jardin ensoleillé où l'on peut prendre son petit déjeuner et repas en se sentant vraiment en vacances. Nos hotes ont été prévenants et discrets, si nous revenons à Montréal, nous espérons pouvoir à nouveau habiter dans ce merveilleux appartement.","10"
"Communication with the host was excellent.

"Thank you to Richard and his wife for hosting us in Montreal, it was a lovely week. The house was clean and well equipped with a rustic hardwood-ambiance, located on a quiet street. Richard took the time to ensure our car was parked correctly on the highly regulated Montreal streets and his wife was incredibly sweet and lent me a travel backpack for our biking excursions. The beds were wonderful, as was the bathroom and water pressure. The house is very well situated by a lovely square and close to the Metro and several shops, restaurants and cafes. Anyone would do well to spend their vacation here. ","10"
"Richard is an amazing host who made us feel welcomed in his beautiful suite. He gave us a detailed tour and valuable directions & info about the neighbourhood. Both bedrooms were confortable and the condo had everything you could think of to make you feel at home.
Great people and place.","10"
"Tant avant d'arriver, par les échanges de mails, qu'au moment de notre arrivée sur place, Richard et son épouse ont été attentifs à nos interrogations.

Il est très propre et entretenu, et parfaitement équipé.
Nous nous sommes sentis chez nous.","10"
"Richard nous a bien accueilli mes collègues et moi lors de notre arrivée. Le superbe logement est situé dans une petite rue tranquille d'un quartier très central de Montréal. L'endroit est idéal pour les voyageurs qui veulent découvrir la vie montréalaise à pied et sans tracas. Des hôtes attentionnés à visiter!","10"
"Richard was a fantastic host! To start off, he was very accommodating with check in and allowed us to access the home beforehand. He also told us a bit about the neighborhood history and gave us lots of tips and recommendations in Montreal. When we arrived at the home, it was beautiful and clean just like in the pictures. The home was equipped with everything we needed to feel right at home. The neighborhood is also very centrally located, close to a lot of restaurants, shops, and a grocery store. We slept four very comfortably in the home, I definitely recommend Richard's home if you are visiting Montreal! ","10"
"The apartment was in a nice central location on a quiet street.  Everything you could need for a few days stay was available.  We appreciated that the place was clean, tastefully furnished, and well maintained.

The parking available is on the street.  Montreal experienced moderate snowfall, which made parking a little adventurous due to changes in the parking rules to accommodate street clearing.  Was not really a problem for us, but for those unfamiliar with the cryptic parking regulations of most cities, this could be a little daunting.     ","10"
"This place is a jewel! Fantastic location: near restaurants, transport links, bars, shops, and the lovely parc La Fontaine. It is spotless, well-equipped, and quiet. I stayed there as I needed to be near L'UQAM and la grande bibliotheque for work, and I have friends in the neighbourhood. It was really perfect for me, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.","10"
"This is a wonderful place to stay. It is clean and safe, plus centrally located on Le Plateau. I was within walking distance (20 min.) to McGill U and 10 mins to Le Metro. The apt is spacious and warm. St. Denis is a 1/2 block to the North with plenty of Restaurants. I loved this place and can't wait to stay again!","10"
"My friends and I had an amazing stay here! It is in the perfect location, just a minute walk from the nearest metro station, a wonderful bakery and a 24 hour grocery store. The apartment was furnished with everything we needed and was incredibly charming. The Plateau neighborhood was very friendly and has countless restaurants and bars to offer. Parking was also free and very convenient on the street directly in front of the apartment. Richard was also kind enough to help us remove our car from the snow when it got stuck as we were leaving from our stay. Overall, I could not have asked for more hospitality, or a better place to stay in Montréal! ","10"
"Richard's apartment is located in a wonderful neighborhood in Montreal, and within walking distance from at least two amazing bakeries and numerous restaurants and cafes. The apartment itself is beautiful and super comfortable. It has everything you could need for a great stay, including a fully outfitted kitchen. Richard and his wife are so kind and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here, and intend to do so as long as it is available the next time I am in Montreal. ","10"
"Les dialogues sur internet, son savoir sur Montréal et ces environs, ainsi que la documentation que nous avons trouvés sur place.
Logement bien situé et facilité de trouver les transports en commun.

"Richard and his wife were wonderful hosts during our stay in Montreal. They were always helpful in recommending places of interest and giving directions. I was travelling with my 11 month old daughter during our stay and Richard went above and beyond to ensure we felt right at home, even provided a portable crib and high chair. The apartment itself is equipped with anything you could possibly need and just minutes from metro, bakeries and grocery stores. Situated in the plateau on a quiet street. I would definitely recommend staying here. ","10"
"Richard responded promptly to our questions and provided easy access.  The listing was as pictured only nicer. The kitchen was equipped with everything imaginable.  For anyone with mobility issues this is the perfect place.  Everything you can ask for:  comfy beds, individual room controls for heat, updated kitchen and bath with ample hot water, and charming décor.  Spotlessly clean.
The neighborhood  seemed perfectly safe.  Parking is city parking so be sure to read the signs.","10"
"Richard est un hôte de qualité! 
Echanges faciles avant et pendant notre séjour, partage de bons plans dans les environs, accueil très sympathique!

Le logement est parfaitement situé, très bien équipé, propre, fonctionnel...Rien à redire!

En résumé, une location à recommander pour visiter idéalement Montréal. ","10"
"We had a  lovely week long stay in the first floor apartment.  It was beautifully and thoughtfully furnished with a small garden in back and very convenient to the Metro, shopping and restaurants.  Richard greeted us our first night and gave us useful information about local shops and restaurants.  We would gladly stay here again.","10"
"Service and amenities were fantastic. The place itself is incredible and of course the location is great!","10"
"We spent a week in Richard and Martine's place in Montréal and found it everything we could have hoped for.  Situated close to transportation or for walking to and about Le Plateau and surrounding areas, it is a the type of lodging Montréal is famous for.  If you know the city then you already know Le Carré Saint-Louis and its ideal location.  And if you are new to Montreál, you will not find a greater introduction to really living like a local while still having all the tourist areas so close at hand.  I have been to this city countless times for my work and for personal pursuits and would choose this apartment far above any other place I have stayed.  Thanks Richard and Martine for providing such a lovely home away from home. ","10"
"Perfect apartment, perfect location, perfect hosts! We stayed in Richard's stylish and cozy apartment for a week in early July, and have nothing but praise. The location in Plateau Mont-Royal is great. In a quiet street with two-story buildings, close to a nice park in a vibrant and great neighbourhood. Downtown is only a 30 minute walk away. With Plateau and Parc Mont-Royal within walking distance in the other direction. And a metro stop close by if you need to go further - or if you don't want to walk. Richard was very helpful with advice and tips, and made us feel very welcome. We travelled as a family of four, with two boys in their teens. The apartment worked out very good for us. On an evening with unexpected rain, we had no problem retreating to the apartment to relax there. Plateau was without doubt the right district to stay on our first visit to Montréal. Relaxed, informal and easygoing. Full of charm and character. Picturesque buildings, good restaurants, and an area where we felt totally safe. If this is what you're looking for, we're pretty sure you will be just as satisfied as we were with this apartment.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Un grand merci à Martine et Richard pour cette location en plein cœur de Montréal. Nous venons de passer 15 jours dans cet appartement qui fut notre ""camp de base"" pour découvrir une partie de cette merveilleuse province qu'est le Québec.

L'appartement offre tous les équipements d'une habitation très confortable et la literie est excellente. On s'y sent vraiment bien !

"Richard goes out of his way to welcome you to his apartment. He makes himself available so you are not isolated in a new city. He gives you helpful hints about what Montreal has to offer. He is interested in hearing about your concerns or needs. I really liked the location near the Square Saint-Louis; it is very central and there are so many places within walking distance. I appreciated the dishwasher and the tastefully decorated space. The beds were comfortable and I used the back outdoor sitting area for a good read.","10"

"Richard was very welcoming and accommodating. The apartment has every amenity. The location couldn't be better -- just off one of the most charming squares in the city and dead central. Even our Montreal friends were impressed by the place.","10"
"
The house is excellent and comfortable. It is very close to the metro station and has several restaurants close by.

In a matter of space, the house bears two couples comfortably. We did not miss any household utensils and the heating system was able to handle the low temperature.

Richard, is a nice and helpful person. We helped in everything that was needed, in addition to demonstrating an excellent knowledge about the city and the history of Province.

If I return to Montreal, I will definitely try to stay there again","10"
"Logement très bien situé et exactement avec tout ce que nous avions besoin. De plus Richard est très courtoie et très attentif au gens qui loue chez lui. Il nous a très bien acceuillit et à répondu a toutes nos questions.

Je recommande cet appartement à tous. Nous avons séjournée à 3 reprises et à chaque fois c'est le même constat, parfait pour nous. Lorsque nous en aurons l'occasion, nous reviendrons chez Patrac avec grand plaisir.

"The place is incredible as well as the hosts. The house was well furnished and contains everything you need. The house is also well located, near downtown but far from the noise! Awesome trip!

"Richard was an amazing host! He was very helpful and accommodating. The apartment is a great space. It was very comfortable. It was clean, awesome layout and close to everywhere you want to be! The street is quiet but it is exactly where you want to be from downtown & the plateau. I highly recommend staying here and hope to return this summer. ","10"
"beau logement, très bien situé.
très bon accueil de Martine & Richard.","10"
"Fantastic flat in a great convenient location. Richard welcomed us gladly with loads of local history and suggestions. Montreal and Montrealera were super friendly and festive .","10"
"We really enjoyed our 9 nights stay here. Very quiet, perfect for 2 couples.  Clean with plenty of room and had everything you need for a pleasant stay.  We took part in the Go Bike Montreal Festival and the apartment was close to starting points.  Limited street parking but we managed to park close by most days - be wary of the confusing parking signs.  Host was very helpful.  We definitely recommend this place!!","10"
"Martine & Richard after great hosts that will help you navigate the neighborhood. Fantastic city Anne we'll return soon","10"
"This is a great place for two couples to stay and still have privacy as the bedrooms are separated. They're also quite spacious. There is only one shared closet, but we managed just fine. Richard filled us in on the history of the area and the house when he greeted us right after our arrival. The kitchen had everything we needed (except a teapot!). The bathroom is a good size. There was lots of space everywhere in the house so we weren't tripping over each other. It was great to have a private outdoor space. Everything is on the ground floor, so there were no flights of stairs to climb. We very much enjoyed our experience in our first stay in an AirBnB. We would highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a great place to stay in a historic area of Montreal.","10"
"Richard and his wife's place was great! Three of us were attending a scientific conference downtown and wanted to have a true Montreal experience so we wanted to stay in the Plateau region. Their place is located in a beautiful neighbourhood and on a quiet street. Popular Saint Denis St is just around the corner and a convenient Metro stop (Sherbrooke) is nearby. Communicating with Richard was spot on and the apartment itself surpassed expectations. I would highly recommend their place to anyone. Merci!","10"
"This apartment is a real gem. It's in a fantastic, walkable neighbourhood and close to all the amenities you could want, including transit. The space was exceptionally clean and very comfortable. The beds were really comfy too. Richard was a great host. Even though he was out of town at the time, we had no issues accessing the apartment etc. This was hands down one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. ","10"
"Location parfaite, très propre, dans une rue plein de charme et près de tout.
Très bonne communication avec Richard. Très bon accueil. Richard est très disponible et très réactif au moindre problème (petit soucis de wifi réglé très rapidement).

Concernant le parking, il est en effet possible de se garer dans la rue, gratuitement. Mais il faut savoir que les places sont très rares et qu'il faut changer la voiture de côté 2 fois par semaines car la ville nettoie les trottoirs. 
","10"
"Logement bien situé comme indiqué dans la description de Richard. Malgré sa proximité du centre ville, il est situé dans un quartier très calme. Martine et Richard sont de très bon conseil pour bien visiter Montréal.","10"
"Richard est juste généralissime !! Jamais vu un host aussi parfait !! C'était un plaisir immense de discuter avec lui et de vivre dans son logement !

L'emplacement est au top du top, juste à coté de la rue Saint Denis (la partie piétonne) et du metro SHERBROOKE ! SUPER calme et y'a même un chat et un hamster qui sont venus nous rendre visite. :)

Je recommande à 1000 % !","10"
"The apartment was clean and incredibly conveniently located. There are many restaurants and cocktail bars nearby.  The metro and several bus lines are less than a 10 minute walk away. Richard has also compiled an extensive list of things to do, eat, and see. Great place. I would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Emplacement en or 
Appartement très agréable","10"
"The apartment was spacious and very comfortable. The location was so central and the neighbourhood is beautiful. The host Richard was very accommodating, it was the best AirBnb stay that we have ever had. I highly recommend it!","10"
"Une adresse à recommander à plusieurs titres. 
D'abord car l'appartement est idéalement placé, à seulement une centaine de mètres du métro Sherbrooke, à deux pas de rues typiques de Montréal comme Saint Denis, Saint Laurent ou la partie piétonne de Prince Arthur, le tout juste à côté des splendides demeures XIXe du square Saint Louis. 
Ensuite parce que l'appartement est irréprochable : tout confort, propre et superbement décoré. A noter: l'absence de télé, déplorée par les enfants, applaudie par les parents.
Enfin, les propriétaires sont à l'image de la réputation l'hospitalité des Québécois : chaleureux, gentils et accueillants. À leur contact, vous profiterez de mille et un conseils et anecdotes sur Montréal et le Québec.","10"
"Bien des choses positives à dire sur ce séjour : on se sent chez soi dans cette agréable maison située au coeur d'un quartier animé et très central, mais dans une rue calme et tranquille. L'appartement est au rez-de-chaussée, ce qui nous a semblé bien pratique (et par contre le rend assez sombre, son seul inconvénient). Espace, confort, de quoi cuisiner vraiment. Tous commerces à proximité, ainsi que le métro. Les propriétaires se sont montrés très accommodants et nous ont conseillés à plusieurs reprises (activités, lieux). Lieu idéal pour 2 couples.","10"
"This is a great apartment located on a quiet side street with a nice park steps away, a vibrant shopping area in the other direction and only a couple minutes walk from bus stops and a Metro station which will get you just about anywhere you want to go. The hosts live next door and will be there to assist if needed but otherwise let you enjoy your privacy. Particularly desirable for our 9 day visit was the fully equiped kitchen which allowed the option to eat out or not.","10"
"Great place, very well equipped with everything you'd want. Fantastic location, very easy to get anywhere. Came with some great recommendations of places to visit as well","10"
"Lovely apartment in a terrific neighborhood, close to bus and metro. Amazing host. Good kitchen space if you want to cook.","10"
"Fantastic home and location. Everything we needed was walking distance and the neighbourhood was perfect. Richard and his wife was a fantastic host and very helpful. Richard introduced himself the next day we checked in and provided us with lots of information about where to access things and how to get there. Thank you Richard it was the best air Bnb experience we had","10"
"We (my husband, my daughter, 16 years, and I) came from Germany to visit Montreal for sightseeing. 
The apartment is fantastic, the decor is very individual and beautiful, it fits perfectly to the house. It is very well equipped with everything you want. 
Richard has made the extra effort and picked out for us individual tips for sightseeing. He is very helpful and  friendly. The communication was absolutely perfect. Thank you so much!
The entire neighborhood is the most beautiful area of Montreal, so sightseeing starts directly at the front door of the apartment. I liked the area and the apartment and everything very much and would definitely book the apartment again whenever I come back to Montreal.

"Excellent logement à Montréal avec une entrée facile grâce à un casier a code pour récupérer les clefs.  Richard et sa famille sont tres accueillants. La propreté du logement était excellente et l'emplacement idéal sans voiture. Nous reviendrons avec grand plaisir !","10"
"Richard's place was exactly what I was looking for. On returning in the evenings after being out and about, walking in always felt like ""home"". A lot of care is put into this dwelling to make guests' stay comfortable, pleasant and easy. 
The location is perfect - I walked to Old Montreal every day, about 20-25 minutes - depends on what you wish to do along the way. Parking was also very easy and Richard's explanations/instructions were precise and correct.
I would definitely stay here again for the value, aesthetics and location.","10"
"We very much enjoyed our stay at Richard's apartment. It was the perfect space for our family (two bedrooms, kitchen, and laundry in particular). We loved our purchases from Mamie Clafoutis - thank you for the recommendation - and we were similarly thrilled with the walkability of the neighborhood and proximity to public transit.

"Richard's listing is a lovely apartment on a quiet street that is still close enough to the action that everything is walkable. Though there is a metro station that's less than a five minute walk if you don't feel like walking. Richard and his wife Martine were very helpful when we checked in, and gave us a tour of the listing and offered lots of great advice for seeing the best parts of Montreal. They were also available whenever we needed them. I highly recommend this listing for anyone coming to Montreal. You'd be hard-pressed to do better.","10"

The neighborhood is awesome with a lot of restaurants and shops in the area should you not want to stray too far. You'll make a great choice staying here!","10"
"This is a lovely rental- incredibly central and yet very quiet ( with some footsteps and early morning activity), use of the back garden for morning coffee, a great selection of pots and pans and a homey feel. An amazing bakery is located close by and we were very comfortable with our family of 4. The comfy chair in the living room could use replacement soon. We would stay here again! ","10"
"Richard's apartment is clean, eclectic, and easy to get to. It is in an ideal location in the awesome Plateau neighborhood but is within walking distance of Old Montreal, Downtown, and other neighborhoods. Everything we needed was at the apartment along with a sweet backyard patio to enjoy a break from the day. Richard is a really nice guy and he even took the time to give us a bunch of great recommendations about what to check out in Montreal, many of which we did end up exploring. We would highly recommend staying at Richard's place and hope to return someday!","10"

"Great time in Montreal and the place was ideal for Old Port and beyond. We enjoyed easy walks to the restaurants in the Old Port neighborhood and everything in the place was fine, clean and what we expected. I would and probably will use this listing again.  Worked out great.  Our host even left us a nice bottle of champagne to welcome us.  Meeting Jonathan to get key went smoothly and with no hitch.  The underground parking was key for us, as we did not want to deal with parking or driving in the city.  A good find!","10"
"We had a very enjoyable stay at Jonathan's condo, conveniently located minutes from the historic Vieux Montreal and walking distance to Rue St Paul, local bistros and galleries, Scandinave spa, the Basilique, and many other sights. Parking was a great amenity, we could leave the car at the condo and not worry about looking for street parking. The condo is well equipped and very comfy, we will certainly visit again:)","10"

Le condo est beau et propre, tout est là.. Vaisselle, serviettes, kit à fondue.. Jonathan a même pensé à nous laisser des essentiels dans la salle de bain (pâte à dent, gel de douche, shampooing, etc.) Vraiment, il nous a accueilli encore mieux que dans un hôtel. Nous avons adoré notre séjour! 

Si on retourne à Montréal, c'est certain que ce sera là. ","10"

It's close to Old Montreal and there are beautiful views. The apartment was as described and an enjoyable space - everything you need is on site. ","10"
"Jonathan was amazing!
My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights and had an amazing time!
When we first got there he met us at the front of the residence and showed us how everything was going to work (what keys to use and where the apartment was as well as how parking would work). Parking was an amazing benefit of this place. The parking is underground in the same building and very secure (did not worry about the car what so ever). The location of the place is right by the port and a very close walk to all the nice attractions (depending on the attraction it was 5-20mins walk). Jonathan welcomed us with a bottle of champagne and a loaf of fresh French bread (which we ended up using to make one of our dinners, we made sandwiches). The condo is exactly like the pictures show (the wifi was easy to connect to, there is cable on the tv or we connected our tablet with a HDMI cable). The condo was very clean and well furnished. Also was provided with traveling amenities in the washroom and also the kitchen (coffee, milk, bread, spices, and kitchen is fully equipped with utensils and cups). Would 100% recommend this place! ","10"
"Great location in Old Montreal!  Jonathan was awesome, creature comforts were all there.  We loved this place and would for sure rent here again.  The place was stocked with a few essential travel items in case you forgot.  And a welcome treat of fresh bread!  Can't beat that.  Highly recommend staying here.","10"
"Jonathan's place was exactly as pictured. He was so helpful with parking our car, getting us settled, and showing us how to get around the apartment. There was champagne and champagne flutes waiting for us upon arrival as well as a loaf of French bread. It was amazingly clean, but he offered to send over a cleaning service midway through our stay. Truly would recommend staying here, if you're visiting Montreal. The experience was better than I could have imagined. Thanks so much, Jonathan!","10"
"Logement bien situé, propre, spacieux et très bien équipé.","10"
"My husband and I would recommend Jonathan's condo. It is a great location and the indoor parking was wonderful. We did not use our car during our visit,we were able to walk or get to the metro easily. There is a grocery store a 10 min walk away and many great restaurants close by. Jonathan is a great host he was there to meet us and show us around. There was milk and eggs in fridge and a loaf of bread. He even dropped off coffee for the coffee maker. This is a great spot for a couple. We would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Nice spot in the old Port. Champagne and bread was a nice touch. Jonathan also thinks of all the amenities you may have forgotten. Quick efficient key change over + explanation. All round great host.","10"

"Spent four nights at Jonathan's place in Old Montreal. The place was just as expected and the included parking was great. Jonathan even had a few essentials available that we had forgot - shampoo, conditioner etc. The location was great, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, including the Bell Centre (half hour) and old Montreal. If we come back to Montreal again we would definitely want to stay here again. Thanks to Jonathan for making our first Airbnb experience a positive one! ","10"
"We had a great stay beginning to end. Jonathan was easy to get in touch with and always responded promptly to any queries.

The apartment itself was very clean and many necessities were provided.","10"

"Our first time to Montreal. The location was great, walkable to old town and the metro in a quiet area near the waterfront. Apartment was large for a one bedroom and well appointed. Jonathon was a fantastic host who left us a bottle of bubbly and fresh bread to welcome us to Montreal. He was very flexible with the check-in and brought over a hairdryer when we realized we didn't have one. Would not hesitate to stay here again on our next visit to this lovely city. ","10"
"We love to arrive to a host is there and friendly. He was! We love places that are spotless and well equipped. It was! We love rain shower heads and nice sheets. It had it! We love coffee makers and supplies coffee. There was! We love in-apartment washer & dryer. You guessed it! We love spacious and modern places. It is that! And perhaps in a city like Montréal with limited parking, we LLLLL (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) EEEE free secure parking on premises. Again, had it!

Did I mention that there is a Bixi bike station seconds from the front door? Well there is. You can download the app and sign up for an account in minutes on your smartphone. We got two 3 day passes for $14 CAD! ","10"
"This lovely apartment is close to everything in old Montreal, and very accessible to the metro and bus lines.  We enjoyed the comfy bed, hot shower, underground parking, large TV, and the nice treat that greeted our arrival. Jonathan always communicated promptly, and met us upon arrival.  We enjoyed our visit thoroughly.  ","10"
"Great place to stay in Montreal. Joe was very accommodating and helpful. Location was great! Would stay here again!","10"

"Perfect location! The place is clean and Joe is a great host. Highly recommended  for a stay in Old Montreal.","10"
"We really enjoyed the condo!  It was really clean and comfortable and a great view to the water!  We loved the bread and champagne that Jonathan left for us. Unfortunately the wifi and television weren't working the whole 3 days we were there but Jonathan tried really hard to get it sorted out. I think he was actually going to change Internet provider as it had been an ongoing issue on and off.  We highly recommend this condo for anyone wanting to stay in Montreal's Old Port!!","10"
"Le condo était vraiment super, propre et bien situé. Il est à 5 min à pied à de la place Jacques Cartier à pied et proche d'une station de location de vélo. Nous avons passé un agréable séjour.
Le lit était très confortable et tout le nécessaire était présent.
Nous avons trouvé l'accueil de notre hôte impeccable et chaleureux.   ","10"
"Great location, directly on the river.  Short walking distance to all of the sites...great location for the fireworks, as well.  The condo itself was nice -
 leather sectional sofa, good sized kitchen, bedroom, bathroom.  Would recommend to anybody visiting.","10"

"Great condo! Conveniently located in the Old Port; on the ground floor, which is super convenient; safe; clean, and I felt as though I was at home.  Would definitely stay here again. ","10"
"Joe was very quick to respond, very accomadating. The shower was warm and water pressure was good, unlike many of the hotels we stayed at. The parking space was a plus, perfect with the small car we had. Location is convenient being just down the street from bonsecours market. Thank you Joe!","10"
"Great location, parking which is essential if your driving.","10"
"Great apartment which looks exactly like the photos!
Location couldn't be better, an easy walk to the old town and port area and about 10-15 min walk (uphill!) to berri metro to access the Olympic stadium, space for life attractions and botanic garden.
Communication with joe was always quick and he was also quick and helpful to reply when we sent a query while we were there.
The car parking in a secure park directly under the building, and you get a key fob so you can come and go as you please.
joe asks you to contact him a hour before you arrive so he can meet you outside which we struggled with a little, we allowed half an hour extra but got stuck in a traffic jam from 6km outside the city!!...we made it only 2 mins late!
We were a bit disappointed after reading other reviews that there was no champagne or bread on our arrival....maybe he's stopped providing it (although there were over 20 empty bottles under the sink!","10"
"This was our first time using AB+B and it went great. The apt was great, excellent location, clean, it had everything you need and more. Joe was very nice and friendly.","10"
"Location TOP .... appartement  TOP et très complet... hôte TOP à recommander","10"
"Jonathan was a pleasure to deal with. He is very courteous and was very generous with his time responding to my linguistically challenged parking signage questions. He made himself available whenever needed, either in person or via phone. 

Jonathan's place was FANTASTIC, clean, comfortable and it is very conveniently located close to Old Montreal, which is where I wanted to stay. A few blocks up St. Hubert and you will have access to an IGA and SAQ to stock up on essentials. If you get to the IGA then the Berry UQAM metro station is right there.

GREAT PLACE! I will definitely recommend and repeat myself :-).","10"
"Appartement très bien situé, rien à dire ! Un sejour, même d'une nuit, vraiment parfait ! Merci","10"
"The location is fabulous, very clean and exactly like the pics 
Joe was very friendly and gave us some great restaurants suggestions.
I was a little disappointed not to find my fav champagne waiting for me like  others did but it was a perfect secure place  and clean to hang your hat 
Would stay again","10"
"Really nice condo, not far away from the old Montreal and the old Harbour.
We stayed here for 3 days and used the bixi bikes. Next bixi station is very close!
The Check-in and Check-out were uncomplicated! 
Joe was very flexible with our check-in and he was really caring and often asked if everything was alright! We recommend staying in his apartment!","10"
"Legitimate! The host was very good in keeping contact even after we arrived to make sure everything was going good. The unit looks exactly like the pictures. Unit is very close to all outdoor entertainment.","10"
"Jonathan a été au petits soins avec nous, disponible il a pris des  nouvelles de nous tous les jours. L'appartement est très bien situé, proche de la vieille ville, mais très au calme. Parfait pour quelques jours à Montréal. Je recommande vivement","10"
"The apartment was an amazing deal. It was sleek, stylish, comfortable, and was a short walk to the old part of the city where there were wonderful shops, historic sights, and restaurants. Joe greeted us with a bottle of champagne and loaf of bread, and showed us how easy it was to park and access the building.  He was attentive and courteous, and we would definitely stay here again.","10"
"This apartment is in a very good location close to Old Montreal.  It is a large, one bedroom with lots of space to spread out, very quiet, offers free parking (huge in Montreal), a washer, dryer (although there was a mattress taking up most of the laundry room), dedicated internet, so the wi-fi is reliable and a very economical price.  There was only hand soap and three little hotel bottles with lotion, shampoo and conditioner in the bath, so bring tissues, bar soap or shower gel.  Coffee was provided, but bring your own tea, creamer for coffee, etc. A great place to stay in Montreal.","10"
"Great location . Easy vehicle parking. Nice clean well appointed condo.","10"
"Recomendo muito essa opção de hospedagem. Apartamento bem localizado, bem decorado, limpo e com todas as comodidades. Joe, o anfitrião, é muito gentil e solícito. Nossa estadia foi muito boa.","10"

"The places is much larger than it looks, in a great location in Old Montreal. It’s a quick walk to many sites. Close to good restaurants.

The place is exactly as described and location was the perfect jumping off point to different neighborhoods in Montreal. Would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Joe's place is a spacious, modern apartment in Old Montreal. It is a great location for taking in the sights of Old Montreal and the riverside parks nearby. If you are a runner, this place is great for a run.  The apartment is fitted out with everything you will need. There is covered parking which we didn't need but this is a major plus for travellers who arrive by car. Jonathan was prompt with communication and showed us the apartment at check-in. A great place to stay.","10"
"Le logement est exactement conforme à la description. Il ne manque rien pour un séjour court où long (pour nous ce fut 7 jours). Très propre, spacieux et confortable. L’accueil de Joe est excellent, il a passé le temps nécessaire pour nous présenter les environs. Il est à l'écoute si l'on a le moindre problème et c'est très facile de communiquer avec lui par courriel.  Le ""vieux Montréal"" est à quelques minutes de marche et on y trouve une multitude de restaurants tout à fait corrects et à tous les prix. En revanche, pour les commerces de nourriture,  il faut marcher un peu, mais mis à part ça, nous recommandons sans hésiter.","10"
"Lovely place, nice location.  Check in and out were smooth and pleasant!","10"
"Joe has a great space in Old Town Montreal which is really beautiful. The space is large, modern and has all the necessary amenities. The shower was not the cleanest it could be but we still really liked Joe's place.","10"

"Great space in Old Montreal! Easy check in/out and excellent value.","10"
"Joe waited several hours for us as we were delayed in coming from the airport
His apartment is larger than we expected and although the internet was not working he made every effort to get the provider to do something about it for us. It is a great location on the edge of the old town and the river. Wonderful to watch the Christmas fireworks in old town just outside the apartment","10"
"Great location, and welcome from our host. The private parking is a plus, especially this time of the year !","10"

"Ideal location for Igloofest! We were extremely comfortable - I haven't slept that well in ages! Joe was a wonderful host, the place clean and modern, and it was fantastic to be in a location that allowed us to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Would definitely love to stay again.","10"
"Fantastic place close to all the great areas in the city. Very walkable. It is a beautiful modern place. He did a great job of making sure we had everything we needed and worked with our crazy schedule. We really appreciate it!","10"
"Host was awesome! Place was great too, could use a little love in some areas (bathroom toilet paper holder and shower doors) and it was freezing cold until we had to turn up the heat. Would of been nice to walk into alrdy heated cozy place. But other than that it was an awesome stay, very nice place, secure building, great location, etc. !!! I would definitely recommend to others.","10"
"- Apartment: Very clean and very cozy apartment. Great location for Igloofest.

"Clean, great location, speedy response- would stay again! Oh- and parking!!","10"

"Great space and location. Joe was very nice and helpful. We had a wonderful stay!","10"
"We loved our stay at Joe’s Airbnb. It was spacious and bright, the bed was comfy and the apartment was really clean. It was in a great location on the river. We really enjoyed walking around the area and exploring the city. Joe was a great host and we would not hesitate to stay at his Airbnb again in the future when we return to Montreal!","10"
"Ce fût ce séjour court et très agréable.  Joe a une très bonne écoute de nos besoins. 

Je le recommande fortement ce logement.","10"
"Joe’s place was amazing, it’s very clean and nice plus the garage It very helpful. The bathroom was very clean and they have a nice shower and bath.  We had a very good experience stayed there. Definitely go back to stay here again.","10"
"Very convenient location, very safe and clean. Easy check in and out. We enjoyed how close we were to the old port where there was lots to do, and also close to the metro to get around the city. The condo was large and very cozy! We enjoyed having a safe place to keep our car during our stay and a comfortable place to come home to after a busy day! Would definitely stay here again next time we visit Montréal!","10"
"Ease of check in and out, prompt responses,  thoughtful check-ins by Joe made this trip stress free.  The home is very nice and location is fabulous! Great place to stay in Montreal.  ","10"
"Joe's place is great. He's doing some remodeling so expect things to be even better. The location is an upscale neighborhood in northern Old Montreal, a stone's throw from the water. If you get a chance, book Jo's place! ","10"
"Joe's place has excellent access to Old Montreal or you can walk a bit longer (or take a short taxi) to Place d'Arts. There's a great kitchen set up but we didn't have to use it with all the wonderful access to cafes and restaurants. It is how it looks with a very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom.","10"
"It’s a really wonderful place for short stay & Joe is a  nice host. Great view to the waterfront especially.","10"
"Joe’s place is clean, easy to access, and well maintained. It includes easy-to-access parking. Joe is incredibly accommodating. Thanks Joe!","10"
"Great location, just a short walk to old Montréal! Included parking which was a huge plus! The apartment was spacious and had everything we needed. Joe was very responsive and easy to get in contact with. ","10"
"Great location at the edge of the old town, right by the water! The apartment was clean and large with a comfy bed. Joe met us at the apartment to give us keys and show us around. He let us check in early which was amazing as we had caught a rather early flight. He’s finishing up a renovation of the bathroom, but overall it was great and Joe made sure to check in with us during our stay to see if we needed anything. ","10"
"Joe's condo is very conveniently located in Old Montreal, steps away from a Bixi station and many attractions near the waterfront. Very comfortable bed and stylish interior. The parking spot was a huge plus, and Joe was friendly and prompt with his communication when we had problems. Very nice place.","10"
"You cannot ask for a better location. The neighborhood is vibrant and we walked almost everywhere. We only took public trans for Parc Jean-Drapeau. The apartment is very nice and Helena instructions were clear. I would try to stay again here if I come back to Montreal. The only con was that we could not turn the A/C ON and it got hot at night.
If you are driving, we park at the Stationnement Place Du Parc (3625 Av du Parc) for $20 every 24 hours. it is 7 min walk from the appartment","10"
"Amanda was a super gracious host. Her apartment was clean, spacious and had a lot of light. It is located in the great neighbourhood of the plateau , close to bars, shops and restaurants. Amanda was very accommodating, helpful and I would definitely recommend her space if you plan on visiting Montreal.","8"
"Wonderful location, very big and spacious apartment that looks as pictured in the photographs. Close to parks, restaurants, bars, and on a quiet street so the spot was perfect. Amanda left breakfast, which was very thoughtful. Leone, Amanda's friend who let us into the apartment, was extremely kind. 
We had an unannounced visit from a construction worker on Sunday morning who came into the apartment, and we were not able to get in touch with the host to see whether we should let him in, which was not ideal. So communication with guests should be improved. Bathroom cleanliness could've been better. ","8"
"We had an awesome stay at maxime's, one of our best airbnb experiences!!! Beautiful apartment, Nice and clean, very good location, central, great park in front of the door and many cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood and last but not least a great host!

"Maxime was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.","10"
"We had at great stay at Maximes. First of all the location is perfect in the heart of the Plataue, right by the beautiful and buzzing Laurier park with lots of great cafes, restaurants and shops nearby. The atmosphere of the area is very relaxed and boho. The apartment is pretty in itself and it's kept neat and clean. Maxime is a very helpful, respectful and friendly host, who offered us alot of great advice and guidance on Montreal. He is very knowledgeable and his love of the city shines through. I would love to come back anytime and highly recommend both apartment and host. ","10"
"Great location and Maxime was super friendly. Beautiful house, fast wi-fi and great area... highly recommended!","10"

"Our stay at Karl's place could not have been any better. Great host, Great place.
Karl wrote back to us immediately and made booking his place super simple and quick.
He greeted us when we arrived and was an ideal host - with a smile despite us being 3 hrs delayed. He gave us all the info and touched base to make sure everything was ok.
His place looked exactly like it did in the pictures - is spacious, clean, has great light and loads of character. Everything you need.
We loved Montreal and staying at Karl's place made it all the better. Great location close to metro station and supermarket.
Would definitely recommend.
Thanks Karl","9"
"Karl was an excellent host for our first stay with Airbnb. He met us at the apartment to give us our key. The place was very clean and welcoming, and he even left out some snacks for us. He gave us his number if we had any questions and was very prompt to answer and very helpful! The location was perfect, just a couple minutes away from the metro and right by bus stops. We really enjoyed our stay in his beautiful apartment and recommend it to anyone!","9"
"My girlfriend and I moved to Montreal from Toronto and needed a place to stay while we searched for an apartment. Karl's apartment was our top choice, and for good reason!

Karl was personally very accommodating. We had to push our arrival date back a day, and Karl was flexible in this matter.

Upon arrival we were blown away with how beautiful the apartment was. The kitchen was fully stocked (Karl left us some food and a couple beers) and had a great gas stove.

My girlfriend and I would definitely recommend staying at Karl's place when you visit Montreal.","9"
"Karl is a friendly and considerate host, ensuring open communication, answering all our questions and even leaving a few beer for us. The apartment is fairly basic, but more than suffices as an excellent base to explore the city, being very close to both a metro station and a selection of shops & cafes (I highly recommend Cacao 70, specializing in all things chocolate!)  I'd definitely recommend Karl's place!","9"
"Karl was an excellent host, he was very accommodating, and communication was almost  instantaneous. The apartment was also wonderful, it had a very rustic and cozy vibe, and once we opened a bottle of wine we had a hard time leaving the place. Excellent location and apartment, would return in a heartbeat.","9"
"Karl was a great host. Our stay was short and very last minute but he was very accommodating. The place was clean and a good size for 2 people. Good location. Street parking was available.","9"
"Karl was a wonderful host and extremely accommodating due to the last minute nature of our trip. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Karl's and would do so again!","9"
"Karl was an excellent host and his place was wonderful. He was quick to respond to texts and emails; he made picking up and dropping off the keys a cinch; and he made himself available to help out if we had any problems. It was blisteringly cold in Montreal, but Karl's apartment was warm and cozy with an excellent vinyl collection and an N64 (MarioKart included!).

The only downsides were that free parking can be hard to find and the wifi was a little weak. I lucked out and, after circling the block a few times, was able to find parking just in front of the apartment, and I didn't really need the internet much anyway.","9"
"Great experience! Karl is an extraordinary host who takes care of every little detail to make sure his guests have all they need! Very helpful, friendly, informative. Great location : clean, bright, warm. Definitely recommend it! Thanks again! ","9"
"Karl is a fantastic host who always replies promptly and is nearby to answer any questions. His place is centrally located and an easy walk to restaurants and two metro stations. Despite the snow and cold outside, the space stayed warm and cozy. I would highly recommend Karl to anyone looking to stay in Montreal.","9"
"Karl was a most gracious host … he was flexible and understanding. His apartment was charming and well prepped for our arrival …Karl was also very helpful with questions and enquiries … apartment is in great and convenient location …Thanks Karl!","9"
"Karl's apartment is well located near the Atwater Station of the Metro - easy for getting into the city centre. I know the area itself has lots too offer too, but my stay was too short and I was too busy to explore it properly. The apartment itself is very spacious, charming, and has all the amenities you may require. Karl is really friendly, very accommodating and prompt to reply to all questions. Overall, a good value for your stay in Montreal!","9"
"A fantastic experience!  

Karl was so nice, and accommodating, and very quick answering any questions we had.  We got in a little later than expected, and he helped us find a parking spot where we could stay for the entire weekend.  Being so close to the metro made getting around really easy, we parked the car and didn't look back.  There were bikes, locks and helmets to use, which were a plus, but we didn't end up using them.

The place is great.  We loved the record player, and the kitchen was perfect, small and stocked.  The greenery around the apartment was a nice touch too.

This was our first time using airbnb and Karl certainly raised the bar high.

Merci encors!","9"
"J'ai adoré mon séjour chez Karl! Une amie nous a accueillis à notre arrivée, et tout était super! Le quartier est formidable, près d'un métro, d'épiceries, de cafés, environ 30 minutes de marche du Quartier des spectacles! 

L'appartement était suffisamment spacieux pour deux personnes!

"Great location and nice apartment, perfect for a long weekend in Montreal. Communication with Karl was easy and speedy, he was accomadating to our arrival and departure times.","9"
"My partner and I stayed in Karl's place for an extended period (6 weeks) when we first moved to Montréal and we found it to be a really good option. The neighbourhood is well-located, close to downtown but also the Lachine Canal and Atwater Market. It also has two metro stations (Atwater and Georges-Vanier, on the orange and green lines respectively) within walking distance and a bixi stand within a 2 minute walk of the apartment. The apartment itself is full of character and charm and is well-equipped with almost anything you could require during your stay in Montreal (a great record collection, to start with!). We found it to be very comfortable. The experience of dealing with Karl has been really great - he is very helpful and flexible (he let us extend our stay a few extra days) and always responsive to my messages / emails. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Karl's place to anyone looking for a place to stay during a visit to Montréal. ","9"
"The reservation was canceled 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Karl was an excellent host. He provided some good recommendations for neighborhood shops and restaurants. The location is quite good--I was in Montreal for a conference at a downtown hotel, and it was a 15-minute walk away, or a very short metro ride. It's also a short walk to the bus to and from the airport, which made arrival and departure very convenient. Flexible arrival and departure times were helpful, and the apartment is spacious and quite comfortable. Thanks for a good stay!","9"
"This was my first airbnb experience for myself. It was very good. Although due to some timing issues we didn't get to meet our host in person, the apartment was great and the experience was awesome. I would recommend Karls place to anyone in need of a place to stay in Montreal.  the location is quite close to downtown without it being loud or noisy.  The facilities are well stocked and parking was much easier than I thought.   Karl was very communicative and gave lots of information for our stay and the surrounding area for entertainment.","9"
"Karl was a wonderful host. His apartment was clean and cozy, and provided a printout of fun hotspots and bars and any information we needed. I would definitely stay again and recommend his place to anyone visiting Montreal.","9"
"Karl was a very thoughtful host and provided us with all the information we needed which was really helpful as we were nervous about driving to Montreal. The apartment was very convenient to access from the highway. Karl was even so kind to arrange private parking for us as his street was under heavy construction. Even though he was out of the city he was quick to reply and arranged a smooth check in/out for us. The location was a great hub to explore the city by bus/subway. Friendly neighbours, fast and reliable wifi.. Thanks Karl!","9"
"Karl nous a super bien accueilli, son appartement était tel que décrit sur le site. Il était vraiment bien placé et avait beaucoup de charme. Nous avons passés un super moment a Montreal et en grande partie a cet appartement et cet hôte merveilleux. Milles merci Karl!
We definitely recommend Karl and his beautiful fat. We spent a great great time ;)","9"
"Although I did not actually meet Karl in person, he was very accommodating and gave me plenty of information about the apartment. His friend Sarah was there to oversee things and was lovely and helpful. The apartment itself was in the perfect location for me, and although it's right downtown the tiny street was fairly quiet. The building is very old and has a lot of character but could also use a bit of tlc, such as a paint touch up. A few things also seemed a bit jimmy-riged together. All and all it met my needs just fine. ","9"
"My husband and I had a terrific honeymoon in Montreal, no small thanks to Karl! His place was cozy, spacious and within walking distance to several bars, shops and restaurants that we frequented. Karl even provided a list of recommendations, which came in handy since we are from the US. Karl was accommodating, and easy to work with. When we make it back to
Montreal, we would love to stay here again. Merci!!!","9"
"La reservation de l'appartement s'est fait la veille, et j'ai eu une réponse positive tres rapidement de Karl, ce qui est appréciable. Ce qui l'est davantage c'est son charmant appartement. Ensoleillé, lumineux et calme. j'y ai passé une tres agréable soirée, et journée le lendemain. C'etait une halte d'une nuit vraiment chouette, avant de partir pour Paris. J'ai pu rester dans la maison tout le lendemain avant mon vol du soir. Je recommande l'appartement de Karl vivement!

"Karl is a great host; he is very responsive and left helpful maps to indicate areas where you can park. The apartment is right off Saint Catherine and is just minutes away from the metro. Reliable host, convenient location, and fantastic price!","9"
"Karl was a terrific host and accommodated our late arrival on the first night super graciously. The apartment itself was exactly what we needed: very close to my work and the metro, as well as cool neighborhoods to eat and go out. The place has a lot of charm, with unique, original architectural details and a very cute vintage kitchen. Overall the apartment had a very European feel and felt quite cozy (and quiet) despite the busy downtown location. Karl set out plenty of clean towels for us, as well as coffee. Both Robin and I enjoyed our stay.  Thanks Karl!  -Danica","9"
"We had a great stay at Karl's apartment. The place has so much character and is in a nice part of town. The metro is easily accessible, and there are lots of nice places to check out nearby. Karl is a great host as well with good communication before and during the trip. Highly recommend staying here when visiting Montreal!","9"
"The apartment was exactly how Karl described it; spacious, very bright and well located. We would love to stay here again as it is such a cozy home.
The metro is very close by so you have access to most of the city whilst being tucked away in a quiet spot. Saint Catherine Ouest is minutes away and is a great place to wander along.
Karl was great at keeping in touch and very flexible even though he seemed quite busy. He'd thought of everything from coffee to towels to make our stay a very comfortable one.","9"
"Karl was a great host and his home was a great base for all of our adventures in Montreal. Centrally located to St. Catherine Street and Old Montreal, it was perfect for seeing most of the city on foot while also being close to the metro station. We were happy to find many great restaurants and even a comedy club close by. :)

Karl provided a map to various eateries which was a big help when we first ventured out to find food. The parking guide that we were given was the biggest help in avoiding tickets in a city that is partially permit, free, and metered parking. Karl was very communicative during our stay and even checked in with us half way through the weekend. 

I would recommend anyone to stay in his home. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious for two people with lots of Victorian charm. ","9"
"  The apartment was wonderful, very clean and comfortable! Perfect location; a quiet side street within a few blocks of the more main areas. Karl was really helpful with finding parking nearby and coordinating getting the key. We didn't know our arrival time until the morning of but he was easy to get a hold of and figure out last minute details. 

Great place and host, highly recommend it!","9"
"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely lovely stay here.  Karl did a great job at making us feel at home.  He had great recommendations of things to do in the area.  He was also very prompt with communication.  The apartment was great, we had everything we needed and it felt very cozy.  Neighborhood was great too, just steps away from restaurants, shopping, and the metro.  We had a great stay in Montreal and we would totally recommend this place to a friend!","9"
"Had a great time. Apartment was cozy for a quick winter get away. Scoring parking right outside was a plus. Karl was super awesome and flexible. Excellent location. Really enjoyed the space, would stay again.","9"
"We had a great and stress free stay at Karl's place. He wasn't able to be there when we checked in, but he sent me a very detailed message about getting the keys, where to go, and how to get in. Once inside, there we're detailed printouts about the apt, parking and restaurants\bars in the area. The parking instructions greatly helped, as we don't know French and had no idea where we could and couldn't park. His place was simple and clean and provided just what we needed for a one night stay in Montreal. The heat was at a very comfortable level when we arrived and remained so throughout the night. The place is old, so be aware. That isn't a negative aspect necessarily, but don't expect hotel quality or the particulars of new or newly renovated bldg. AGAIN, there was nothing wrong with the place and we appreciated the charm of an old bldg. I would recommend staying here to anyone. We were able to walk to most of the areas dense with bars and restaurants within 15 minutes. In fact with a few minutes you can get to St. Catherine which literally has everything located on it.","9"
"Karl's place is in a great location, well equipped and comfortable. My husband spent well over two months in the apartment and it became our home away from home in Montreal. We got used to the few quirks in the place which can be attributed to the age of the building. Overall a nice place and a great host, thank you so much!","9"
"We stayed at Karl's place for just over a week and enjoyed every minute of it. The apartment is really bright and very cosy. It has a few quirks like creaky floors, but that just adds to the charm. The apartment was very clean and its well situated. Karl was a great host. He provided us with extra keys and checked up on us to make sure everything was ok. He was also really easy to contact and quick to reply. ","9"
"Karl was a great host! We didn't get the chance to actually meet him but he provided lots of information about his place and Montreal before we even arrived. Key pick-up/drop-off was easy, the apartment was very clean (and charming!) and his parking diagrams were very much appreciated (especially since we were there on Victoria Day Long weekend). You couldn't ask for a better location either - the metro was a few minutes walk away and there were plenty of places to eat/shop nearby. If you're looking for a charming apartment that's right in the middle of all the action, his place is perfect.","9"
"Beautiful apartment in a fabulous location! Everything was as pictured, though some parts of the apartment seemed a little aged, such as the bed frame which was held up on blocks. Nonetheless, we had a wonderful four day stay. We used the kitchen only to keep ingredients for light breakfast (no stovetop use), but the fridge definitely came in handy. The living room receives a lot of light and eating breakfast at the table by the window (which actually has a quaint view overlooking a small playground) was a very nice amenity. Overall, an adequately clean, safe, comfortable apartment. The privacy was highly valued, as was the three-block proximity to the metro. A great value that I would highly recommend to other travelers!","9"
"We’ve had a wonderful time at Karl’s place. The host was kind enough to leave detailed instructions of nearby places to visit, so getting around is quite easy and, most importantly, there is a subway station at walking distance so you can get quickly wherever you want. The place is as described: spacious and with a very useful fully equipped kitchen (not only the basic hardware for show, but all kinds of spices and things a person really uses for cooking). There is an espresso machine and a turntable. Both were very useful, as I could enjoy some java while listening to calypso record I had just bought (many nice places for used vinyl in Montreal!). There are some quirks one might need to get used to: since it is an old house, the wooden floors are noisy, there is a steep stairway to get to the condo, and the doors or windows might get difficult to open or close; actually one of the external windows fell onto my friend finger as he was trying to deal with a jammed latch. It bleeded badly and hurt a lot, but thankfully there was a first aid kit well equipped to deal with the situation. I do not blame the host, since it was an accident, but it is certainly related to specific oddities to what is overall a charming place to stay.","9"
"Safe area, easy access from the 720, easy access to grocery stores and the metro, and walking distance to great restaurants and pubs. All in all, I wouldn't say this matched the description exactly...when we arrived, there was no AC and no wi-fi. However, when we called Karl to ask about the missing AC and wi-fi, he was accommodating -- he came to install a window-mounted AC unit on Day 2, and he did try to get us wi-fi, but unsuccessfully. The bedroom window gives onto a sort of alleyway where surrounding apartments have their balconies. On our first night, the neighbours had a party on their balcony that kept us up until about 2 am. It was impossible to block out the noise. The floors are very creaky, which makes it difficult to be quiet (i.e. if you're getting up at night, expect to wake up everyone else in the place). ","9"
"Karl was a great host. His place really felt like home. He was very communicative and accommodating with checkin and checkout times.","9"
"Overall this was an ok experience, and the host was away but really attentive. But - the apartment's condition didn't meet our expectations based on the pictures & price point (we would say it was ""fairly pricy"" - not super cheap, but not super expensive based on other listings we looked at). Would definitely stay again at a cheaper price, or if it was more polished. More details: There were multiple nights when the neighbours were loud until very late - 2am, 3am. Though the kitchen has plates, some spices, some dishes (enough to cook ok), it was not easy to cook in because there was no light & no small spoons and some other small items were missing. The bathroom was clean, but pretty rickety. There was only men's soap & no shampoo (though we were told there would be toiletries). The AC was only available in the bedroom, so it got pretty hot in the kitchen sometimes. The good: great location, clean, really attentive host, pretty spacious, and had great amenities (washer, dryer, etc). Overall I think this listing would be worth the 'fairly pricy' price if things were more polished around the house - it has a great location, great vibe, a great host, and is pretty spacious.","9"
"we didn't get a chance to meet karl but check in was painless.
apartment is in super great location, easily walkable and real neat walk... some good restaurants along the way.
the apartment itself is old, furniture is tired, some of it is charming :)  we had no issues, once that air conditioner in the room started doing its magic it saved our lives.","9"
"Karl was a very accommodating host -- before our arrival, he provided detailed information about the location and parking instructions. He was friendly and responsive to our questions.

The location of the apartment is convenient, just 5 min walk away from the closest metro station and from shops and restaurants. 

We didn't spend too much time in the apartment itself but it is functional with all the essentials you would need!","9"
"We had a fantastic time in Montreal while staying at the apartment. The entire experience was seamless from the time we booked the space to the time we checked out. Karl made us feel very welcome and at ease as he made himself available if we ever had any questions or concerns.
 
The apartment was just as described with a little added personality, which made us feel like we were staying over at a friends place. The location of the apartment was perfect for us since it was so close to the metro. The two bikes which Karl made available for us to use was icing on the cake as we got to explore the city from a different perspective. Overall we were both very happy with our experience and would definitely recommend this listing to any of our family or friends. Thanks Karl!","9"
"Place was easy to find and was very large even for two people.  All the amenities were provided.  Place was in good condition.  Lots of apartment buildings nearby so at times you can her noise form the neighbours.","9"
"We had a wonderful stay at Karl's place. Although we never actually met in person, he was always very quick to answer our questions. We were there in September, and the window boxes were full of geraniums. This made it an absolutely lovely place to have our morning coffees. That living room gets so much sunlight! We were also particularly drawn to this place because of the available bikes, but everything we wanted to see and do was so close that we ended up walking everywhere instead. The only downside was that the bed is ever so slightly uneven so that both people end up sinking into the middle. This would be fine for a couple but maybe annoying for friends sharing a bed. Upshot: the big couch is divinely comfortable. All in all, it's bright, unique, and well located. We would definitely recommend it. ","9"
"Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable at Karl's place. There were 3 of us (adults) staying there but this place could easily hold 4 people. The apartment was exactly as listed and was very tidy and clean. The location is very convenient as it's just steps away from the metro where you can catch the bus or train to take you anywhere. Karl was always available by text/phone whenever we had questions for him. We would definitely rent this place again next time we visit Montreal!","9"
"This apartment was exactly as it looks in the photos. We loved it as soon as we walked in. The big windows let in lots of sun and the whole thing was very spacious. We felt immediately welcome, because of Karl and because there were even a few things left in the fridge that we were free to take. Highly recommended and we'll be back!","9"
"Overall, our experience staying at Karl's place was great! He was very friendly and communicative during our stay. From checking in to navigating around the area, Karl was helpful through everything. The place itself was charming, spacious, private and thankfully in close proximity to some cool restaurants, markets and a metro station. Karl helped make our vacation run smoothly and he was an incredibly generous host. Thanks, Karl!","9"
"Karl was very easy to communicate with about check in and with any questions we had. The apartment was large, clean and in a great location. ","9"
"Karl is a very kind and thoughtful host, his place was very clean and everything was in order.  The apartment was well equipped with everything that we needed and it was very convenient because of its close proximity to all the popular places in Montreal. Karl stayed in constant touch with us till the time we were there and he was very prompt in replying to our queries. I highly recommend his place!","9"
"Karl was extremely responsive throughout the booking and the stay. His apartment is great - the lighting is incredible and the old feel is very cozy. It's exactly as shown in the photos and maybe even a little larger. We were able to use his kitchen and supplies to cook, which was really nice. Karl made us feel super welcome and the apartment was the perfect getaway for the weekend - definitely recommend!","9"
"Karl was responsive and had some great suggestions for food. The apartment was as advertised and is close to a street full of great restaurants. Overall a positive experience in a great city.","9"
"Karl was super accommodating -- even going out of his way to tune up the bikes for us!

Great apartment in a convenient location. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Karl!","9"
"Karl was very responsive and made it easy for us to get access to the apartment. The unit was just as pictured and very clean. It included everything people coming to Montréal for the weekend might need. The location is excellent and we were able to park right in front of the house. A great experience.","9"
"Karl's place is wonderful. Located quite central, next to Atwater Metro you can reach all the interesting sites even within walking distance. The apartment is cozy and very quite. Karl is very welcoming and ready to answer any question. The handover was quick and relaxed. Thanks Karl!!!! :)","9"
"Karl was there to welcome us even though we only booked it day of and showed up early. His apartment was just as whimsical and homey as the pictures suggested and the neighbourhood was a perfect home base from which to adventure. He lent us a couple bikes as a bonus which made exploring the canal, Atwater market and old port a breeze. The kitchen was great for our brekky overlooking the playground outside where the neighbourhood kids play - great little residential pocket in the heart of downtown. The gas stove, cappuccino machine and tea assortment were a great touch. I would highly recommend Karl as a host to anyone looking for a peaceful space in a great location, him and his home are a pleasure. ","9"
"We stayed at Karls apartment for a 3 day weekend. He was out of town at the time, but was very trusting and inviting towards us in his home. The apartment is perfectly located, a short walk to St-Catherines St. where you can find all kinds of restaurants and bars, grocerie stores, and close to the metro (subway). We really enjoyed our stay.  Karls apartment was very comfortable, clean, and had everything that we could of needed. There was always street parking during our stay, and there is even a cute little park right across the street from the apartment. Karl was kind enough to send us a message over the weekend to make sure that everything was going well. We would definitively recommend staying at his home for your stay in Montreal.","9"
"The place was great, a nice little neighborhood, close to everything, spacious, the host was very quick to respond to questions and everything went very smoothly","9"
"Karl was a great host. He answered all my questions in a timely manner via text message and phone. His place is in a great location. Its walking distance to At Catherine's. One main factor was the free parking near Karl's apartment.  I would recommend staying at his place.","9"
"We had a great time in Montreal, and having a host like Karl made it all easier and more home like. Beautiful apartment and super comfortable. Great location also, which made it easier to get in to town and mont royal. Definitely recommend this apartment and host.","9"
"Great apartment thanks so much Karl!","9"
"The apartment is very old and has a lot of character. Very bright location with lots of shops/restaurants nearby. It's also extremely close to the metro! Karl checked up on us and we really enjoyed our stay in this cozy apartment.","9"
"Our trip to Montreal and our stay at Karl's was great!
He was very communicative and helped us even before we arrived. He provided guidance about parking, tips about the city and was very helpful in all regards. We are actually sad we didn't get to meet him in person.
The apartment itself is very cute, clean and great location. Super close to metro stations, etc...floors are a little bit squeaky, but hey, that's part of the charm of staying at an old victorian building. ","9"
"This was my first time booking an Airbnb, and Karl was a great host!  He provided detailed instructions for check in and parking, making the process smooth.  The apartment was cute, clean, and great for our needs.  Location is walking distance to restaurants and close to the metro for easy access to all of the landmarks and sights of Montreal!","9"
"Our stay at Karl’s was fantastic. We felt welcomed in his home, and not just because in the cute park across the street was a Fa Lun Da Fa marching band performance that put a little spring in our step. The front door key was a bit sticky to open at first, but after the first couple times we’d mastered it and it became a point of pride for us. His home was nice and cozy, with nice architectural details like stained glass windows and a lovely fireplace. We specifically loved using the espresso machine every morning as a special vacation treat. Karl was also nice enough to loan us his bikes, which made getting around cheap and way more fun than being stuck underground on a nice day. We feel like we saw so much because we were able to get around this way! If two wheels aren’t for you, the city is very walkable and his home is just a short walk from the train station. Overall, Karl was friendly and communicative, even recommending bike routes for us to take. We would be happy to stay at his home again! ","9"
"We had a great stay at Karl's apartment. The location was great: a couple of blocks from the metro, within walking distance of a good number of shops and restaurants (including the best ramen I've ever had), and free parking that wasn't too difficult to come by in a quiet neighborhood. 

Karl was generous with his amenities, welcoming us to use anything we found in the kitchen and making check-in and check-out super easy. The apartment wasn't anything fancy, but it was cozy and just what we needed. 

As a host, Karl is clearly concerned with his guests' experience. He gave me a bunch of recommendations for things to do in the area and checked in several times via text/email even though he wasn't in the area at the time of our stay.","9"
"This listing was perfect for a quick 3 day weekend trip. Karl set us up with instructions for check in and we had no problems getting in and set up early in the day.  Parking was great we got lucky and found a great spot around the corner where we were able to leave the car from Friday when we arrived till Sunday when we left.  A big selling point for us was that bikes were included we had a great time riding around the city and not having to worry about where we would park the our car.  Overall we had a great stay and enjoyed experiencing a new area of Montreal","9"
"Karl was very gracious and always available to answer any questions we had during our stay. The home was very clean and comfortable, the location was absolutely perfect for exploring the city and we felt very safe.  Not one complaint.","9"
"This was a delightful apartment.  The location was great. We could walk to Old Montreal and the Latin Quarter in about 40 minutes, and approximately the same to Mont Royal (I can't quite remember the exact timings).  Very close to restaurants on Ste Catherine and also Crescent St.  
Karl was very helpful.  We didn't meet him but he sent instructions as to how to get in the apartment and also very helpful and detailed parking instructions/tips.
The air conditioning was great especially on such a hot weekend. We didn't really use the kitchen at all except to store a few things in the fridge, so I can't comment on the kitchen really, but overall this was a good choice to stay at in Montreal.  Thanks for letting us stay there Karl! ☺","9"
"Nice place to stay. Easy to get around and close to lots of shops and restaurants. Karl answered all our questions and was extremely easy to get in touch with.","9"
"While Karl's place was clean and centrally located, it definitely had a deep bachelor vibe; personal touches like the plants and some of the artwork shown in photos of the apartment were absent, leaving the place feeling a little Spartan. Also not accurately depicted was the somewhat ripped and shabby furniture in the living room. Ok, so maybe not the best place for a thirty something married couple, but for those seeking an affordable spot in Montreal, this was hard to beat. What to expect: The pros: A great location, walkable to tons of restaurants downtown, and a fifteen minute walk to Atwater Market and a couple of metro stations. Also close by was a little park, which screens movies on some summer evenings. A well equipped kitchen - being in Montreal will make you want to binge on good food. With the markets so close, you may want to prepare your own meal (we just gorged on bread and cheese, mainly, but a fridge and toaster made this easy). A charming old building - lots of nice architectural touches like plaster molding, big windows and high ceilings gave the apartment an airy feel. It was clean (mostly) - the floors felt freshly cleaned, the linens were crisp and there were a couple of freshly washed towels. While there was still some trash and recycling from the previous guest, none of it was stinky, so not too bad. The cons: Parking - while Karl have ample direction in what the parking was like in the area, it was still a bit of a pain; when no street parking was available, we had to park at a meter overnight and be up and back at the car by 7am to either move it or pay. As this is a densely populated area, parking gripes come with the territory, but if you don't have to drive, you will have one less thing to think about. Transients - while I don't mind telling a guy ""I'm not interested"" when he's trying to sell me wine or stolen nail polish out of his backpack, some people might. Again, it's downtown, and this isn't the Ritz. Communication: As not everyone traveling to Canada internationally has the ability to text freely, it might be good to get instructions on how to get into the apartment in advance. While I told Karl of our travel plans, and when we expected to get there, he told me that there would be a lockbox with a key, but not the location of the lockbox or the combination, so we had to stand on the porch with our bags for a little while while we texted Karl for the rest of the necessary information we needed to gain access. He responded within a few moments, but having the info in advance would have been cooler. Bottom line - if you are looking for affordable access to Montreal and don't mind hanging out on dorm-quality furniture, this place is tops. 22-year-old...","9"
"Karl was a very helpful host and staying in his apartment was a blast. if there was ever anything we needed he would offer to help and was very good at communicating with us the entire stay. We couldn't have picked a better location with the metro station and shops all at our doorstep. his apartment has so much character and we would stay there again. cheers Karl!","9"
"Karl's place was absolutely perfect! The location can't be beat - so close to the Metro and tons of amazing restaurants - and such a perfect size for exactly what I needed. Karl was incredibly helpful and quick to respond to any questions I asked, and I had such an amazing time. I would 100% recommend this place. Merci!!","9"
"Karl was very welcoming and communicative throughout my stay. The apartment is a cozy one-bedroom, and everything is old but charming. Relics like the little gas stove and the freestanding tub/shower combo were interesting but not inconvenient.

My favorite part was the bicycles (Karl has like 5 of different sizes and styles) that made it really easy to get around more comfortably than Montreal's Bixi system. It was also nice to be greeted by the landlord's huge fluffy samoyed and the neighbor's Persian cat.","9"
"We didn't meet Karl, but his check in system worked good for us. Like other said, this is an old apartment and the lock is a little sticky (Tip: turn left to open the door and right to lock it). My wife and I like the feel to live in the antique atmosphere.  This is a perfect location to explore Montreal and there are plenty good restaurants within 5 minutes walk. The parking spots are very popular, but we can always find a spot (Tip: read the sign carefully). ","9"
"We had an amazing time. Karl was easy to contact any day. The location was great! Super close to all the shopping you can imagine. Old town was easy to get to and we were able to use Karl's bikes but also took a long walk on another day. We also realized right before we left just how close we were to Mount Royal and hiked there from Karl's place.","9"
"great appartment in a nice area. parking space hunting is really time consuming though...","9"
"Had a great stay in Karl's place. Depends on what you are looking for but it's well located and close to the more commercial side of Montreal, shopping, bars and nightlife. Also a highlight is having the bike(s) at your disposal. Parc Royal lookout is only ride away and definitely recommended at sunset or in the morning. Karl was super helpful and communicative.

The area has some characters and the apartment does have a certain student vibe but for the price and location as a solo traveler or a couple I would definitely recommend. 

","9"
"Karl was excellent host, although I did not meet him in person he was available 24h and very helpful, and also provided help with parking and other issues. His apartment is very close to metro station and that is great advantage. ","9"
"Karl made excellent arragements for our arrival and even though he did not have the chance to meet us in person he communicated well throughout the stay, checking in with us to make sure that everything was alright. The bikes were a nice touch as well, this is a perfect hub for exploring Montreal.","9"
"Karl's place is a comfortable apartment that is conveniently located close to anything you may want to do during your time in Montreal! Just a short walk from night life, the movie theater, an arcade, the grocery store, plenty of restaurants, lots of shopping, and many more. He was a great host and the apartment was exactly as described in the listing. Would stay here again!","9"
"The location was perfect for us, Karl was really helpful, got us bikes, everything was smooth. This is a short description because our 4-day staying in Montreal was very busy and we couldn't enjoy the apartment's facilities. Hopefully next time.","9"
"Great place and Karl was a good communicator.","9"
"The apartment was in a great location, just outside of the core downtown so things were very walkable. The apartment was spacious and the host was good with communication. Would recommend staying here and we would stay here again. ","9"
"Karls apartment was just as the pictures and we really enjoyed our stay there! There were some misunderstandings upon arrival but Karl was very quick to resolve them and all in all we had a really good impression of Karl. I would absolutely recommend his apartment if you want a cozy and spacious place, and the location is great. Really close to the Saint Cathrine street in downtown (and to one of the best breakfast spots!), walkable distance to Mount Royal and to Old Montreal. When we missed our train from Montreal, Karl was super nice and let us stay in the apartment after check out! Thanks!","9"
"Karl's place is just as pictured. Nice, lots of light, and close to public transit and shops.

Free street parking is a plus as we drove in from quebec city.  

Karl is welcoming and generous in his offerings. Would recommend the stay. ","9"
"My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip to Montreal and Karl's place was in a really good location for us (a block or so away from the metro). Also very close to shops and food! Parking was a bit confusing to figure out (definitely ask beforehand for a map or something if you don't get service in Cananda). The place was nice and charming, and Karl helped us book a reservation for a restaurant when we didn't have phone service. He communicates very quickly! ","9"
"Karl's place is perfect in terms of location. It is definitely old,but has a character.Karl seems to be a nice person.We did not see him in person,but he was reachable and answered back promptly. The only negative thing was cleanliness. The place definitely needs some cleaning.","9"
"We had a great time at Karl's place! It is in a fantastic location and was very comfortable. Karl was very easy to get a hold of and was great about giving us early check-in/check-out times. I would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Good place to stay. Close to many interest points downtown","9"
"This apartment is in a great location and easy to walk to restaurants and the art museum. We would recommend Karl as a great host who was very responsive me helpful!","9"
"Описание жилья очень подробное и четкое, именно то, что вы увидите. Прекрасное расположение: недалеко от метро, но до центра вполне можно дойти пешком, рядом есть велостанция. Продуктовые магазины и кафе недалеко от дома. Само жилье чистое, теплое, красивое, в приятном районе. 
Мы не разу не видели хозяина лично, но Карл очень быстро помогал нам с решением всех вопросов. В списке рекомендуемых к посещению мест нашли интересные для себя, поход в Comedy Nest был отличным! :)
Спасибо прекрасному хозяину! Это отличное место, чтобы остановиться в Монреале.","9"
"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour. L'appartement est très agréable, bien équipé et idéalement situé.","9"
"Karl's place is close to shops and restaurants. It was convenient to walk out and find ourselves in the middle of action. We stayed during Montreal's 375th birthday and parades happened just a block away from Kyle's place. 
We had a great time. Thanks Kyle for hosting!","9"
"Karl was very helpful! He sent us awesome info so we could figure out parking. The location is great! Lots of great things really close by. The place was very charming!","9"
"Just stayed at Karl's for 3 nights and had a great time! Karl was very helpful and easy to reach. His place has a lot of charming details and feels very cosy. The location was perfect! I would definitely stay at his place again","9"
"We were very happy with our stay. The apartment had all the amenities we could need, it was near great restaurants, and was very easy. It was near a subway, but it's a bit far from most of the key spots if you're visiting for a few days. Parking on the street was great if you can find a spot in a free zone and keep it there, but it was difficult to figure out where to put it during the one-hour street sweeping. The wifi worked well, the area was quiet enough to sleep well, and the air conditioning was nice. The only real downside for us was that the apartment is really not for tall people. The bed is very short with a footboard that made it so my husband had to sleep on the pull out couch (not comfy!). His head also stuck out of the shower. Other than that, it was a great apartment for our needs and we recommend it. ","9"
"Logement bien placé, proche centre et commodités (métro, supermarché, centre ville), flexibilité des horaires de la part de Karl.","9"
"Karl's apartment was in a great location and great size! Though parking on the street might seem challenging because of required resident stickers, we were able to easily find parking using Karl's detailed map. The location was right near a metro stop, and a couple blocks from St. Catherine street! There was a grocery store not too far either. The walk to the old city was maybe 25-30 minutes, we enjoyed being able to go many places from this location! We weren't able to use the bikes because it was raining but it was nice to know they were able to be used! Karl was accommodating with forms of communication, given that we did not have data to use and could only use Wifi infrequently! Thanks for a wonderful stay Karl!","9"
"Жилье Карла чем-то напомнило нам питерский старый фонд. Квартира эта с характером и особенной атмосферой. В ней ей все необходимое, она просторная и очень солнечная. Магазины, рестораны и остановки общественного транспорта находятся в шаговой доступности. 
Из минусов: здание старое, в нем нет лифта и чтобы подняться на второй этаж, вам придется преодолеть два достаточно крутых и узких лестничных пролета. В соседнем здании в данный момент ведутся строительные работы, которые иногда начинаются в 7 утра. В спальне имеется кондиционер, тоже далеко не бесшумный, но со своей работой справляется.","9"
"Really charming little apartment in a very good location. Karl was very helpful in sorting out everything from the door-locking techniques to the wifi. 
Walking distance to plenty of good restaurants and into downtown. Not too far if you fancy a walk up the mountain too. ","9"
"Karl was a great host and was quick to respond to any queries we had. The property itself was very charming and has everything we needed for a comfortable stay.","9"
"Karl is extremely communicative and accommodating. The apartment has charming Victorian details and is centrally located (especially near good restaurants and a market).","9"
"Great location! Only a 5 minute walk to the metro station and many restaurants and grocery stores. The apartment was cozy and has everything you would need for a weekend getaway.","9"
"Would highly recommend Karl's place. Karl himself was very helpful at answering questions considering this was our first time using airbnb. Location is excellent. It's a very short walk to Rue Ste Catherine which has a bunch of very good restaurants (I would highly recommend SamCha to anyone who likes Asian food -- it blew me away.) Also a short walk to the metro. Would definitely stay here again if we make another trip to Montreal.","9"
"This place was very cute and had everything we needed. We were able to borrow bikes which was great. The espresso machine is also awesome. Close to the subway and a commercial stretch.","9"
"My wife and I spent a weekend at Karl's place. The location is great. We were able to easily find parking in front of the apartment several times over the weekend.

We never actually met Karl, but that was not a problem at all. Karl was great communicating with is and were able to easily get into the apartment without him there.

The apartment is represented accurately and we would definitely recommend staying there.","9"
"My girlfriend and I wanted to go to Montreal for a week trip. Found Karl's place and it checked all the boxes. 
 
Location: It's centrally-located near the metro(s) which are the best way to get around the city.  Also within walking distance of Mount Royal which was very welcome as that was on our destination list. There's also a mall nearby so if you need a pharmacy or anything it's easily-found. Timmy HoHo's is nearby as well if you want your caffeine fix. 
 
Cleanliness: Very clean and well-kept. Had no issues with the condition of the apartment. 
 
Style: high-ceilings and very similar to a pre-war place in NYC if you're familiar with it. Very much liked it and the price for what we got. 
 
Note on parking: We drove up and threw my car in a nearby lot for $52 (CAD) for 4 days ($13/day). Was easier than dealing with moving my car and the street cleaning.  The parking in the area does require placards for certain times and free parking isn't necessarily in the immediate area. Karl said he could provide info on the parking, but I didn't ask about it and just decided to leave my car in a lot. 
 
Overall, I liked the place and was very happy with the trip. Karl's a great host and kept in contact throughout the trip.","9"
"Very close to St. Catherine's street. Parking is tough, it's limited. We got lucky twice and not so lucky one other time where we had to pay. Karl is great at communicating and answered our messages very fast.","9"
"Karl's place is really charming and looks just like on the pictures. There was a problem in the apartment once and Karl came the same day to fix it. Communication was really easy and relaxed. It's close to the metro and just a few minutes walking distance from St. Catherine's street.","9"
"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful two weeks staying at Karl's while in Montreal! The apartment is very large, spacious, and classic Montreal style with cool wooden floors and a big claw foot tub. The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we need! Check in and out was very easy as Karl provided clear instructions and we had great communication with him whenever we needed anything. 
The apartment is in an ideal location- you can walk absolutely everywhere, from Atwater market (10 mins) to the metro (<5 mins), to great grocery stores steps away, a couple of Tim Hortons for epic Canadian coffee, and all major downtown areas like St. Catherines, Quartier de Spectacles, le Village, St Denis, St Laurent, Little Burgundy, St Henri, etc., Really it's ideal! It's also a very quiet area so we were never disturbed, and had lots of privacy. 
We actually booked this apartment because we had booked another property months ago, and the host suddenly cancelled - we were really stressed when it happened but are now so happy it did because we were able to stay in this apartment instead, and it's much more our style. I loved it, and would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Montreal.","9"
"Quel appartement plein de charme! des boiseries anciennes partout, des vitraux, une déco rétro... et quand même un lit bien confortable! L'appartement est exactement comme montré sur les photos, et j'y ai passé un excellent séjour... 
What a charming flat!! Old wood everywhere, colored glass windows, vintage decoration... and still a really comfortable bed! The flat is exactly as shown on the pictures, and I've had an excellent stay. I didn't meet Karl in person, but he was very responsive during my stay, and left precise instructions for check-in and check-out. An added bonus was that I could use his bike to get around... Overall, I'll happily come back next year!","9"
"Clean, easy check in, good communication. We got lucky with a parking spot right out side the apartment. Apartment is located 2 blocks from St Catherine's street and only a few minute walk from downtown. Also close to a metro station although we walked almost everywhere to experience the city. Would absolutely stay again.","9"
"Great location and a great host! Thank you for a wonderful stay Karl!","9"
"Karl's place is THE Montreal experience. Having lived in Montreal the first 25 years of my live it was just like being home. The location is right downtown and walk-able to everywhere I wanted to be. The apartment itself was clean, uncluttered and cozy. I loved the fireplace and stained glass windows. My friend and I both agreed we'd move back to Montreal if we could get an apartment like Karl's!","9"
"Notre séjour chez Karl s’est très bien passé. L’appartement est agréable, en particulier quand il y a du soleil car il est très bien exposé. La déco d’epoque et le plancher donnent beaucoup de cachet au lieu. Il y a un côté un peu « bancal » dû à l’anciennete de l’appartement mais c’est ce qui fait son charme ! En plein centre-ville c’est un excellent rapport qualité-prix ! On est près de tout et notamment de la rue Ste Catherine pratique pour trouver des restos. La communication avec Karl a toujours été très simple et rapide. Nous ne l’avons pas rencontré mais il y avait un Check in par boîtier qui nous a permis d’arriver quand on pouvait.","9"
"This was by far the best place I have stayed at in Montreal and I’ve been a few times. You can’t beat the location. The beautiful old style apartment is a short walk from St Catherine and Crescent. Concordia is in walking distance as well. Karl was very helpful with giving tips on which gyms were nearby etc. The bikes were a big plus for us too. I hope to stay here again next time I’m in Montreal! Thanks again Karl","9"
"A lovely apartment in a great location. Really perfect for my 10-day work visit to Montreal. Having access to a washer/dryer made it easy for me to travel light. And I appreciated the small touches like providing an HDMI cable for the TV, which allowed me to watch my favorite trashy TV shows on my Netflix account.","9"
"Great location. Close to the metro. We never got to meet Karl since he was at work when we got in but his communication was great and we had no problem finding the place. Highly recommend.","9"
"Karl's place is great! It's a cozy apartment on a quiet side street, yet so close to everything. Karl is a great host and made our stay very easy, including plenty of information with timely responses. He let us use his bikes which was amazing! Almost anywhere you want to go in a 25 minute ride or less. Thanks Karl!","9"
"Great space! Went during a heat wave and the air conditioning in the bedroom was a life-saver, especially in an old victorian home (which retains heat a lot). Pretty central to downtown and Karl was very quick to respond to any of our questions.
Multiple Bixi locations in the surrounding area and right near two Metro stations.","9"
"Great place.  Great location.  Perfect base to explore Montreal from.  
","9"
"Appartement confortable et très bien situé pour métro, bus et commerces. Lit très confortable. Par contre le canapé-lit est peu confortable. Dommage...Merci pour réponse rapide pour une location de dernière minute. Natalie","9"
"Best part of the place is its location, which is close to the metro, bus stops, and within walking distance to St. Catherine. Parking is relatively simple, you can park on the street (read signs carefully though) and some parking garages not too far away.  

Overall, I thought that the airbnb was worth its value. The place might be a little tight for four people, which Karl mentioned, but we made it work. I'd suggest bringing your own shower essentials though.","9"
"The photos of the apartment are accurate.  The location is just on the outskirts of what is officially ""downtown"" (aka Centre-Ville), a block from Atwater Avenue, a big neighborhood border of sorts.  It suited me because I could walk to classes I was taking downtown, and because, courtesy of the bicycle that came with the apartment, could easily access the trails around the Lachine Canal, take advantage of the great farmers market plus known as the Atwater market, and explore neighborhoods west (like Westmount, etc.).  When you first arrive you might think, oh, the entry stairs look a little shabby, etc.. but otherwise the apartment is great inside, and the neighborhood is good, if perhaps a little off-beat.   A block or two in either direction are gorgeous looking row houses, etc, that would probably cost twice as much, if they were available, so I consider this an EXCELLENT value overall.   AC worked (important for the summer), laundry facilities in the bathroom (excellent for my two week stay, etc.).  ","9"
"The location was convenient for the event I was attending, given the many bike lanes in the area, and the apartment was comfortable and had most amenities including good wifi. It was great that it had A/C in the bedroom and a fan in the front room. We liked the green bike that was  included and used it to get around.  The apartment block had lots of colorful characters, though the children's playground directly opposite kept things sweeter. All in all, a good trip & experience. ","9"
"My stay at Karl's apartment was just fantastic! Karl is an amazing host and the checking-in process could not have been better.  The location of Karl's beautiful apartment is perfect for a stay in Montreal: close to the metro, beautiful parks, down-town.  And the apartment itself is homely and gorgeous: what a great way to visit a city when feeling immediately at home, and that is exactly how I felt in Karl's great apartment.  Will cross fingers that - whenever I am back in Montreal - Karl's apartment will be available! Don't want to stay anywhere else. Thank you, Karl, for being such a great host. Sofia","9"
"I was excited to stay at this place after reading some positive reviews, but to be completely honest myself, and guest were disappointed.

My biggest complaint was this apartment was in desperate need of a deep clean. It was clear this has not happened for a long time,  if ever. At one point, I looked beneath the couch where I was sleeping, and there was at least 2 inches of caked filth, dirt and dust. Then I began to notice is all over the house. The shower was dirty and shower curtain was stained, like it had not been changed for some time. Both of the doors are hard to lock, the front door and door to the apartment (not Karl's fault, but just a warning). When you walk into the hallway of the building your hit with a stench of natural gas (Karl said that the owner of the building is decommissioning some of the old gas pipes, so there might be a residual odor). I understand that this is an old apartment, but even more reason to try to clean it better and remove some of the junk. The house is really cluttered with all kinds of stuff.

To top it off the neighbors had a big party on Saturday night until 4 or 5 in the morning. Kept me up most of the night playing techno and yelling outside. Obviously this is not Karl's fault, but I get the feeling this happens somewhat often as the building and neighbors had a frat vibe. It was amusing that the ""house rules"" say not to have parties, well maybe thats because you can just join the one next door.

On a positve note Karl was a nice and responsive, but I don't feel that makes up for the condition of the house and lack of cleanliness.","9"
"Karl’s apartment was perfect for our week stay in Montreal. We didn’t get to meet Karl as he was away but his communication and check in/our process was impressive. He was very diligent. And, the bikes were an extra plus. 
It’s close to everything you need and the size of the apartment was very decent for Montreal. We were very happy!","9"
"Karl's place is great - easily accessible from the airport, close to shops and restaurants, and very homey!","9"
"Nice apartment to spend a few days in Montreal. Although we did not get to know Karl, the check in was really comfortable even though we arrived late to the apartment. It is well located, close to a metro stop and many restaurants as well as in a quiet zone.","9"
"Honneteté et respect sont essentielles dans une location, Karl néanmoins me semble sympatique mais je ne recommande pas son appartement sans une bonne réhabilitation .","9"
"Karl's place was so perfect for us! It's a great set up, easy location, incredibly comfortable and cozy. We will definitely stay again if we return to Montreal and I recommend it to anyone! Merci Karl!","9"
"We loved this quaint, authentic "" Montrealesque"" apartment..In a quiet location but close to everything..Had a wonderful time.","9"
"Karl’s apartment was a warm and welcoming haven from some chilly days in Montreal! The space itself is cozy but roomy. It has some beautiful trim and other historic details, including a gorgeous stained glass window in the bedroom and a lovely mantle in the living room. It is centrally located within walking distance of scores of excellent restaurants and bars on vibrant Saint Catherine’s Street and also within walking distance of a lovely neighborhood strip of shops to the south, near the canal. It’s a longish walk or a quick drive from the old port, and only 15 minutes from the airport. Karl gave clear directions, was available and responsive, and overall an excellent host.","9"
"If you're looking for Victorian charm in Montreal for a great price, Karl's apartment is the place for you. We especially enjoyed the beautiful fireplace, cozy kitchen, stained glass and big claw foot tub - tres charmant! The apartment is also near to lots of amenities and great places to eat. Checking in and out were a breeze and we were especially grateful for all the info Karl provided on nearby parking. We will definitely try to stay here next time we are in the city!","9"
"Charming Victorian apartment in an awesome location with an awesome host.","9"
"lovely little place with a great bath tub, nice warm lighting, and a comfy bed","9"
"The apartment is absolutely beautiful. Everything you could hope for in an AirBNB stay at more. The location is ideal, and Karine and her family are extremely accommodating and generous. Moreover, the apartment is pristine! I'd recommend it to anyone. ","10"
"The place is very nice. The location is perfect - the house was next to a park within a very quiet community, but also just one block away from a main street with lots of restaurants. The rooms are very clean and organized. We did not meet Micheline since we arrived late but still got the keys and every information we need.","10"
"We spent a lovely week at Micheline's beautiful apartment in one of Montreal's most engaging neighborhoods. The apartment was bright and spacious, and equipped with everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and we slept soundly. I would have thought there would be more street noise right in town but it really was not noticeable.

The location was perfect - since the weather was fine we lingered often in the Square St Louis. The cafe on the square not only is convenient - it has the best coffee we've had in a long time and delicious sandwiches. Many many other restaurants were just a short walk. We also used the Bixi bike rental stand on the square to borrow bikes for an outing to nearby Parc la Fontaine, which is also within walking distance if you prefer not to bike.

Micheline was easily reached by phone and text. I would definitely stay here again.","10"
"It was a great experience staying at Micheline's place. The apartment was at a convenient location (3-5 mins walk to metro station); and with a lot of amazing restaurants around; Micheline replied message very fast, and they were very flexible and friendly.","10"
"Marcos was polite and very professional when we first arrived.  The condo was amazing and kept spotless.  We were in a great part of town and very close to the metro for areas that we a little further away.  Staying here was great.  An ideal area to get where you needed to go!","9"
"Marcos and Mari's apartment was a great location! The parking was clutch.  The apartment was modern, clean and comfortable. Walking around Old Montreal was easy and convenient. We will definitely be back! ","9"
"Marcos & Mari were great hosts. Marcos replied by text within an hour whenever I had a question or concern.

The location was perfect. Two blocks from Rue Berri & St Catherine by the Berri-UQAM train station. Just far enough to not hear the crowds for Fierte, but close enough to walk out to the festivities.

The apt was immaculately clean! My friend said it was so clean, she was scared to walk in it haha. Also, I enjoyed the simple and modern furnishings. It would be as if I had furnished it myself, so I really felt at home :)

I really enjoyed having the privacy of the apt and being stress free in a safe building. The air conditioner worked perfectly against the scorching heat outside! The smart TV is great for bringing your own media to play. I had music and concerts in MP3, MP4, MKV, and AVI formats which all worked to my surprise! 

Also, the bed in the bedroom is a lot bigger than the photo looks! I think the photo ""squished"" the bed haha. It's at least a queen size I think.","9"
"Good place and excellent location. Would recommend.","9"
"Marcos & Mari's place is wonderful- clean, comfortable, and in a great location! Walking distance to a lot of great stuff. Getting in and out was a breeze with clear instructions from our hosts, and they were very responsive when we had questions! We absolutely loved our first visit to this amazing city!","9"
"Marcos and Mari's condo was super close to all the best restaurants on Saint Denis and just a few minutes walk to the core of Old Montreal! Check in and check out instructions were clear, excellent and flawless. The flat was modern, clean, and gorgeous! Thanks again for the stay! :)","9"
"Marco and Mari were very friendly and helpful. The check in and out were simple and everything went smoothly. This is a great condo in a great neighborhood, I honestly found it to be nicer in real life than in the photos.","9"
"Very clean place. Check-in was straight forward and simple. Convenient location with PARKING!","9"
"Marcos was an amazing host and very accomodating. The apartment was spotless and tasteful. The location was outstanding with tons of stuff to do within walking distance or a short cab ride. Would definitely stay here again!","9"
"Marcos was extremely helpful and flexible as we arrived and was quick to respond to emails if we had questions. We enjoyed the location as it was close to main Subway station and lots of restaurants on Saint Dennis. The apartment was clean as described. The garage felt secure and was very clean as well.","9"
"Great Experience! Marco's place was awesome! He wasn't able to meet us for check-in but he left detailed instructions even a baby could follow and he always responded to text messages within minutes!

The place is exactly as shown in the pictures. Really clean and cute. It's also in a great spot: Quiet but close to everything.

Would not hesitate to recommend Marco's place to anyone.","9"
"The apartment was perfect, great location in old port.  Marcos was a great host and very responsive, will stay there again!","9"
"We were visiting Montreal for a 3 day music festival that was happening in locations in Old Montreal and Place des Arts. This was a perfect location to either walk from or get the Metro 2 blocks away. The condo was exactly as described on the site and it was a pleasure to stay here: well equipped, very clean, and a quiet building. And given Montreal's confusing street parking rules, it was nice to have the indoor parking and not worry about tickets!   We would return.  ","9"
"Marcos and Mari's apartment was the perfect spot for our long weekend in the city -- clean, centrally located and conveniently close to a variety of transit. The pick-up instructions for the keys was extremely clear and well communicated. 

One small note: the residents do live here full time... from the photos we were not expecting to find a full fridge, computers, full closets. etc. Not a huge deal, but it took a bit of navigating to ensure we weren't unintentionally invading their privacy.

All in all, highly recommended!","9"
"The apartment was very clean and had plenty of amenities such as clean towels, sheets, and cookware. We enjoyed the easy walk to the downtown and Old Port area. Marcos and Mari were very responsive to questions and were helpful along the way! Parking inside was extremely helpful, considering the heavy snowstorm Montreal was experiencing. Thank you for a great stay! ","9"
"Our stay at Marcos and Mari was truly a seamless and smooth experience! Conveniently located a 5mins walk to Old Montreal and 10min walk to downtown, every place was very accessible. A very clean and comfortable stay and indoor parking is a major plus. We would love to revisit and stay at Marcos and Mari again! Thank you.","9"
"A perfect 10/10 for Marcos and Mari.
Very easy to deal with. No issues what so ever. Very clean.
Do not hesitate to rent the apartment. The parking included is a huge plus.","9"
"Nous avons adoré notre séjour chez Marco & Mari. L'appartement était propre et fonctionnel et surtout bien localisé.","9"
"It was a very comfortable stay.. Everything was clean n neat, easily accessible. And they were just a phone call away for any assistance needed. 
My wife really loved the way the apartment was done and was kept so well organised. It looked n felt very pretty. It was our first AirBnB experience and it was v pleasent. ","9"
"We enjoyed our stay here and would come back/recommend to others!
Marcos was easy to get a hold of prior to arrival and  for check in, and was patient in addressing my questions and helping me check in.
The apartment was clean, comfortable and well-furnished. Marcos and Mari were excellent hosts: they made sure to post the wi-fi password throughout the apartment; they laid out fresh towels, shampoo and soaps; they made up a tray of coffee and goodies; and they even left us a letter to welcome us and to wish us well on our trip. 
The neighbour is very well-situated (close to Chinatown, two Metro stops, Old Montreal, Rue St. Catherine and the highway). The closest grocery store is about a 10-15 minute walk away. The underground parking was very convenient. If you're planning to travel to Montreal over the summer (2016), be aware that there's tons of construction which will affect how you get to the underground parking and around the city (not a deal-breaker but make sure to plan ahead!). ","9"
"Great place","9"
"Marcos and Mari's condo is in a great building at a convenient location to the Quartier des Spectacles and Old Montreal. Although we didn't get to meet in person, our check in was easy and the space was clean and well appointed. ","9"
"Marcos & Mari's place is great. It is located in a quiet neighborhood, and its close to the Berri UQAM subway station, IGA supermarket, and the Old Port of Montreal. The place is clean and the amenities are complete. We did not get to personally meet Marcos and Mari, we were only communicating via Airbnb's messaging yet they were still very helpful and accommodating in our questions. My husband and I highly recommend the place. We will definitely pick this place if we ever go back to Montreal.","9"
"Marcos and Mari were great, they were very attentive and made sure we had a great experience. The apartment is in a great location and looks just in good in person as it does online. Highly recommend! ","9"
"Marcos and Mari were responsive, helpful and generous. They were very prompt in responding to our questions. Before the day we arrived, they sent us another note with logistical details and directions to the parking, and left an awesome hand-written note in the apartment. 
The apartment itself was modern, well designed and clean. It had everything that we needed for our short stay, including the in-door parking. The location is great - we could walk to a majority of the places we wanted to check out. Highly recommend.","9"
"Marcos and Mari's condo is the perfect home-away-from-home! They are amazing hosts, responsive and available as needed, but completely unintrusive. The condo is modern and spotless, and with the parking and proximity to the metro, it can't be beat. We hope to visit again soon!","9"
"Wonderful hosts!! Apartment was in beautiful shape. They were very accessible and left great directions for getting settled. The whole trip was improved by the ease and warmth which we felt in sharing their place. We could not have imagined a better stay!","9"
"A great place to stay in Montreal ! You are close to all the hot spots by walking but still in a very secure emplacement. The condo was super clean and there is air conditioning. It is pretty small but perfect when you are 2 or less. The host are adorable (even if I didn't meet them) and always there to answer your questions.","9"
"Pleasant initial email, OJ, chocolate, crackers and water was available, and their apartment had interesting books and wall decorations.","9"
"My stay at Marcos and Mari's apartment was very comfortable and pleasant.  The apartment is modern and very centrally located.  The entire experience was enjoyable and the check-in/check-out was seamless and flawless.  They left a nice note and some chocolates to welcome me which was a nice touch.  It felt like a home away from home and I thank them for allowing me to stay!","9"
"Host communicated quickly and was responsive with questions.  The initial access to the apt was difficult, as the call buttons to be buzzed into the building were either not working correctly, or due to the late hour, the host did not hear their call.   The unit was clean, quiet and as described.  We enjoyed our stay.  Thank you!","9"
"Marcos and Mari were great hosts from the time we booked to the time we checked out -- i.e., they answered all our questions and made sure we were all set to ""check in"" and ""check out"". Also, without prompting, they provided us with information about getting to their place from the airport (take the 747 bus). Their place was clean and cool (temperature). The building is in a great location (close to two metro stations and within walking distance to the old town). Very positive experience. ","9"
"Felt incredibly welcome and loved the apartment and location - would not hesitate to stay here again with great hosts!","9"
"Claude's condo was great - and a perfect location for me - right next to the convention center and other hotels. Also Claude was helpful every step of the way.","10"
"Excellent space. Great location. No complaints, only praise. I am already planning to book here again when I return to town. ","10"
"This was my first experience with AirBnB.  Everything that was described by Claude - luxurious condo in Old Montreal - was exactly that.  Claude was very welcoming, and he was very responsive in answering all of my questions about the location, condo, parking, restaurants etc.  The condo itself is very nice and well kept.  The condo comes with a full and modern kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room.  In addition, there is very nice natural light throughout the whole apartment especially in the morning.  Lastly, the location is block from the metro, and a 5 minute walk to the heart of Old Montreal.  Overall, it was a very positive experience, and I would highly recommend staying here if you can.","10"
"Claude was a great host. Everything was as depicted in the photos. The apartment has great views of the city, and is in an ideal location for exploring Old Montreal and Downtown. ","10"
"Arrival was seamless. Claude made it very easy for us to get into the unit.  We appreciated him following up with us to make sure we got in okay.  The place was very clean and it was well stocked with coffee, extra towels & pillows.  Bed was comfortable, AC was great and he had an electric fireplace which came in handy too.  He was responsive throughout the process and  we never waited more than a minute to get an answer on an inquiry.  Location was outstanding!  Heart of Old Montreal, steps away from Notre Dame, Rue St Paul & the water.  A great breakfast spot called Tutti Frutti is very close by as well.  Will definitely be going back and will be recommending to others.","10"
"The apartment is in a great modern building very close to old Montreal/ Notre Dame etc. There is a subway/ metro station right across the road, so lots of shops, restaurants and supermarket close by. 

It is tastefully decorated, exactly like the pictures, and everything you could possibly need is catered for. Having the utility room with the washer and dryer in the apartment itself was very useful for us as we were on a long trip travelling with a baby.

Overall communication as well as check-in/ check-out were seamless. Very happy with the stay and would happily come back here ","10"
"Thank you Claude.
This is my second airbnb on my first holiday in a long time.
It was so clean,modern and right in old montreal.
I love architecture,art,culinary arts and appreciated my stay as close to things I love.
Claude was quick in returning any questions during my stay.
Thank you Claude for making my stay fabulous!","10"
"Claude was an excellent host and extremely responsive during our stay. The apartment is located in prime real estate, just a few blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral, Old Montreal, The Old Port, and right across the street from the Place D' Armes Metro Station. From Place D' Armes, you can go anywhere in the entire city. Perfect apartment for a couple. Go there!","10"
"Great location; in downtown, right by the subway, and basically everything you need. The place was in a secure building attached to the Embassy Suites. Good size for 1 person and fine for a couple. Didn't meet Claude at all but he gave detailed instructions on how to get in okay. Parking garage attached for $25 a day which worked out well. Overall, a good place for 1 or 2 people! ","10"
"As a Broadway performer who's constantly on the road in and out of hotels, I've stayed in my share of crummy hotels. So when I can I strive to find spaces that have a comfortable feeling like you were in your own  ""home"". Claude's condo felt like home and was absolutely fantastic. From the kitchen to the bathroom and bedroom, my partner and I have nothing bad to say about this place or the location. The location was absolutely fantastic and quiet. 
The condo was very clean and exactly as pictured. Washer and dryer in the apartment made laundry super convenient. Parking is located within the building as well for a fee. We had a great view from the corner apartment. Beautiful expansive windows. Neighbors were very quiet. Building itself was well kept and is a 5 min walk from the metro station, lots of great restaurants and bars and Notre-Dame Basilica. 

Be aware that most of OLD DOWNTOWN does close early. But it's defiantly not as busy and touristy as DOWNTOWN, which was a huge plus for my partner and I. 

We definitely look forward to staying here again. ","10"
"Great location, on the edge of views Montreal, with Metro station right across the street. Bright, modern, clean apartment, with pretty much everything you will need.  Minor point, would have been nice to have a little kettle to boil water for tea etc.  Would definitely stay here again. ","10"
"We would recommend staying here!","10"
"Communication facile par texto. Instructions claires.

Logement impeccable près de tout ! Rien à dire !","10"
"Claude was a great host and was very attentive to my needs. The place was exactly as advertised, right in Old Montreal. I would definitely stay here again the next time I am back in town! Thanks again Claude!!","10"
"Completely stress free travel! I cant sing enough praise for this rental. Everything was great: easy indoor parking, close proximity to attractions and walkable to nightlife; beautiful and spacious condo with a great modern vibe; great host- thanks, Claude!","10"
"We had to amend our travel plans at the last minute to avoid driving in a winter storm, but Claude was very understanding and accommodating. The condo is beautiful and in a wonderful location. The place was pristine and comfortable, especially the lovely little electric fireplace! The building was easy to access and super quiet. Parking instructions were a little unclear but Claude is extremely communicative and responded to our inquiries almost immediately.  

The condo is within walking distance to numerous little shops and cafes, and right around the corner from the Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal. There is a metro stop within comfortable walking distance but we did not utilize that much. Overall I would definitely recommend staying here, and would consider visiting again the future.","10"
"Claude was a super host I extended my stay several times and he was able to accommodate without any issues. Loved the location close to metro station along with other necessities. Most definitely coming back again.","10"
"My husband and I stayed there for a one night romantic escape from the kids. The place was cozy and comfortable. The couch is to die for and the bed was so comfortable. The place is even nicer than the pictures and the view of the city at night is breathtaking.

Claude was a great host. The weather forecast changed to freezing rain on the night of our Arrival and Claude was very accommodating with changing the reservation to the following night. He met us upon arrival with the parking pass and door key. He also messaged us when we arrived and the following morning to make sure everything was alright. 

We would definitely recommend staying at this condo!","10"
"This spot is really as beautiful as it looks, and Claude is a thorough and gracious host.","10"
"I stayed in this apartment with my boyfriend for the New Years holiday . We had a great time, everything was perfect ! It was very clean and convenient ( location wise as well as having access to a kitchen and a gym in the building ). Claude was also very responsive when we contacted him with questions . Highly recommended!","10"
"We just stayed for two nights at Claude's lovely condo. It couldn't have been more convenient for our visit to the Montreal auto show. It is indeed a high end condo with lovely furnishings. Claude is a pleasure to deal with. He made both the arrival and departure super easy and stress free. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. In fact I hope to be back.","10"
"Our stay at Claude's was everything we were hoping for. The apartment is exactly as described and as seen in the pictures. Claude was very easy to communicate with and was flexible with our plans as we were flying from NYC. The location in Old Montreal was fantastic - walking distance to metro, stores, restaurants, and beautiful sightseeing. Definitely recommend! ","10"

"Le logement de Claude est exactement tel quel par rapport à la description. Un emplacement de choix en plein centre-ville, une superbe vue sur les gratte-ciel de la métropole puisque le logement est une unité de coin et un immeuble très tranquille.

Communication facile, flexibilité sur l'arrivée et le départ, que demandez de plus? Je retournerai à l'appartement de Claude sans hésiter lors de mon prochain séjour pour affaires à Montréal!","10"
"Beautiful place and great stay! Would stay again.","10"
"O apartamento é bem localizado, especialmente para aqueles que paticiparão de algum evento no Palais de Congrès. Mas seo  objetivo é curtir a cidade a passeio, o apartamento é também uma ótima opção, por permitir o acesso ao metrô,  a atrações turísticas e eventos no vieux-port. Claude fo muito gentil e estava pronto a ajudar qdo necessário. ","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"I would highly recommend this apartment for a Montreal visit. The apartment itself was pristine and clearly very well maintained. The location was perfect - just a short walk to Old Montreal, Old Port, and multiple metro stations. Claude was also an excellent host and was extremely helpful and responsive to any of our needs. ","10"
"Exactly as advertised. It's a beautiful, spacious, clean, well-kept, and Claude was a great host, answering all our questions promptly. It's a little pricey but it felt like staying at a brand new luxury hotel as opposed to a lived-in apartment, and it was in the same price range as all the decent hotels in the area but with much more space, a view, privacy, and a kitchen. Comfy bed, big bathtub, lovely for a little getaway for my boyfriend and me. Steps from beautiful Old Montreal but away from the crowds. We even got lucky and found street parking around the corner, which was free all night and most of Saturday/Sunday. Wish we could have stayed longer!","10"
"Great place near convention center and old town.","10"
"This is very nice apartment in the heart of Old Montreal.  We stayed here for 3 nights and the accommodations are perfect for 2 people.","10"
"The was my first experience booking with airbnb, Claude's apartment on the 14 floor was absolutely amazing! The place, the location the ease of the before and after for check in and check out and  the bed was so comfy too! I would go back in a heartbeat. I was very timid to book my vacation this way instead of a hotel but I am so pleased I did. The window views, the location was key, you had everything around you. Bring good shoes 3 nights and about 24miles of walking... it was great! Full kitchen if you like to pick up a few groceries or snacks. The only tiny thing I wish I had was a fan, it seem to get warm in the apartment and you couldn't adjust the air to your liking. Other then that no complaints and we can not wait to go back!  You must try this place.","10"
"The apartment is very comfortable and made my 5-night trip to Montreal for work much more homey. The kitchen is well-equipped with basics as well as coffee and the place had everything I needed. It was very clean and the bed and couch very comfy. Despite being downtown, the apartment was quiet. The only thing that was not great was the strong smell from the air fresheners the building has placed in the hallways. If you are scent-sensitive or prone to headaches from smells, I would caution you on this. If not, great because this is a fantastic spot to stay. :)","10"
"L’appartement était conforme aux photos. Location parfaite et cuisine bien équippée. Je recommenderais sans hésiter!","10"

"This is such an amazing place, It was my first time visiting Montreal but I discover that Everything I wanted to do or everywhere I wanted to go were few mins walk away from this building, and with the fact that parking in this city is a pain, I literally just walked everywhere and appreciated the beauty of the City while I didn’t worry about driving. In addition, this apartment is a Lovely place, I really enjoyed my stay and the host was very helpful and available when there was anything I need to know or wanted, in general, my stay here was superb, Claude is a Great Host!","10"
"Claude's place was very clean and exactly as described. The area was great and things were very walkable! Claude was very fast to respond to any questions and was happy to let us store our bags in the room after checkout.","10"
"Claude was very helpful when we had a challenge. The view is great. The location is so close to all that is fun in Montreal. It's very close to the Metro, which makes it easy to check out other parts of Montreal. There a many taxis near by because of the proximity to hotels. We would definitely book again.","10"

Claude was a wonderful host--very responsive and lovely to communicate with. I only wish my trip had been a bit longer so I could have spent more time appreciating the fantastic historic neighbourhood.

We walked to the Old Port, Chinatown , St Catharine’s Street for shopping, downtown Montreal, etc.  We arrived late from Toronto and self check-in was super easy with no issues.  Claude was amazing with his communication and responsiveness to all our questions prior to and while we were there.  We highly recommend this place and we be coming back soon! ","10"
"Good place, comfy bed and sofa , located in old Montreal, perfect for travelling around the area . A little difficult for finding the parking, especially that Montreal is mostly one way streets. Ac maxes out and cant be adjusted higher. a few bugs at night (uncontrollable) ","10"

"Nous avons croisés Andréa et Robin quand nous sommes partis, et ça a bien ""cliqué"". Ils ont l'air très sympas et on s'est tout de suite bien sentis dans leur appartement;
A part le frigo, sdb et chambre dans la cave qu'on a du nettoyer en arrivant, l'appartement est spacieux, avec grand jardin et deux chambres. Cuisine, salle à manger et salon. Cependant le faite que ce ne soit pas tout propre-nickel-rénové a rendu notre séjour plus à l'aise avec les enfants.. 
La situation est pas mal, mais avec des petits c'était excentré et un peu loin des coins denses en activités. J'ai adoré l'épicerie italienne à deux pas de la maison!

"We arrived late at night with two little kids and dead tired. To find a welcoming letter in the mailbox was warm and detail oriented and we appreciated it very much. Andrea did a great job explaining the neighborhood and as well as perks inside the house.","8"
"We had a great time at andrea's place. The appartement is well-located near metro fabre and a supermarket. The neighborood is really peaceful and charming.","8"
"We had a fantastic time at Andrea's place. It is conveniently located near a supermarket and the metro. She also wrote a letter, which was very detail oriented. ","8"
"Amazing host!","8"
"While the host can work on dusting the place (and washbasin block) before a guest arrives the place is good as it is located close to shops  and accessible to public transport.
I would also recommend guests to carry their own kettle or microwave or a vessel if you are travelling with infants and want hot water. 

","8"
"Andrea's place is cozy and funky at the same time. It's an apartment in a standard 2 story older Montreal building and the usual issues with building age showing. We felt at home here, much better than a sterile hotel! The location is perfect, one block from a busy street, that we never heard any noise from. It's a quiet neighbourhood with little traffic on the street out front. A metro station and large grocery store and drug store are a 2 minute walk, so you can get any necessities and get anywhere in Montreal easily. You don't need a car to navigate the city from here. Andrea communicated clearly and accurately described her apartment and neighbourhood. Most enjoyable, thanks!","8"

Encore merci !

"We had a great time at Auréliens place. He's a very nice and caring host. When we were late on our arrival due to traffic jam in Montreal he was flexible with the ""check-in"". 
The room is even more spacious and beautiful than I expected from the pictures. Comfy bed, whole apartment very beautiful and clean, nice neighborhood. Thanks for this great experience. Would definitely stay again with you! :)","10"

It was a great location across from the Olympic stadium.

","10"
"We had a nice vacation in Montreal, Aurélien was a nice host, he suggested us some places where to eat, and if you love pizza you defintely have to go to Pizzeria dei Compari, as he told us. He had the room ready by the time we arrived, and we had everything we need. The house is located near to some of the places we had in our agenda to visit,like the Olympic Park, Biodome and Botanical Gardens. If you come by car there's enough free parking around, and if you plan to move by public transport, there's a subway station 5 mins walking distance.
If we will go again to Montreal, we will probably stay at his house.
","10"
"I was really happy that aurelien was very flexible on my time of arrival. I checked in really late since my bus from Toronto got delayed and he would find a way to check me in. Unfortunately due to conflicting schedules we never met but I had no problems at all. The stay was nice... In a very quiet neighbourhood despite being quite a distance from downtown. There is a lovely local market nearby which was very nice too. Thanks aurelien!","10"
"The room is everything as described in the listing. A very convenience location which is a couple minutes walk from the Viau Metro station and is next to the Olympic Stadium. I got a C$18 metro pass and I could go almost everywhere in Montreal. One tip is if you arrive late, you better get something to eat at the airport before coming, since there is NOTHING open after 9pm... well, later I found there is a diner about 20min walking which open till 3am, but definitely nothing for personal cares like soap or shampoo. I had to took the Metro back to UQAM (7 stations) to get MacDonald, but still couldn't find those cleaning products...

Use (Hidden by Airbnb) Map wisely...

Aurelien is nice but I only met him twice in the 6 days stay... Once when I arrived and the next was the night before leaving, when I was doing laundry... 

The only thing I didn't feel comfortable is there's no lock on my room door... As coming to a new place and I don't know the people inside the apartment, I felt not quite secure... ","10"

Aurélien's place is in a quiet neighbourhood 3 minutes away from Viau metro station, taking you downtown in around 15 minutes. It's also next door to the Olympic stadium.

"Aurelien a été très accueillant et aimable. La chambre est très spacieuse (j'y ai mis plusieurs valises). Son appartement est très calme et a quelques minutes de la station Viau. La chambre et les lieux communs sont également impeccables (la cuisine et la salle de bain). De plus, Aurelien a su rester discret.

Aurelien was very helpful and kind. The room is very spacious since I was able to store several suitcases in it. The apartment itself is in a quiet and low key area of Montreal and is very to Viau station. The bedroom and common areas were spotless. Above all, Aurelien is low key and I have hardly seen him during my stay.

"This was a great airbnb. It was so close to the metro - maybe a minute and a half of a walk - and right on the edge of the Olympic park. My only issue was that I recently had hip surgery, and to get into the airbnb you have to go up two flights of very steep stairs. So for me that wasn't always easy - but it was clean, practical, and quiet. I hardly knew if my host was around which is how I like it. He was very courteous of my privacy. In addition he made check in easy as my flight to Montreal had been delayed, and he was able to accommodate. ","10"

"Appartement conforme au description bon rapport qualité et hôte sympathique et discret.","10"
"Aurelien est un super hôte. La chambre est très grande. Nous sommes restés 7 nuits et tout était parfait. Très proche du parc olympique et de l'arrêt de métro Viau (moins de 5 min à pieds) ! C'est le top pour aller en centre ville également !! Vraiment rien à redire !","10"
"The bedroom and apartment are comfortable and quiet indeed. Close to the metro, buses and city bikes.
Aurélien is great host, although we did not see much each other he is very responsive and with some good recommendations!","10"
"Je vous le recommande absolument! 
Superbe appart, propre, près de tout et du stade olympique en plus !!!","10"
"Great host, always attentive and the place has a very well location. I definitely recomend it...","10"
"Bon rapport qualité prix , la chambre proposée est extrêmement calme ce qui m'a permis de dormir comme un bébé pendant toute la durée de mon séjour.
Le lit est confortable et la chambre est bien aménagé
Bonne location également , le logement se situe tout prés d'une station de métro et permet de se rendre au centre ville très rapidement.
En résumé très satisfaite de la chambre proposée par Aurélien .","10"
"Aurélien was so kind accepting my request at the last minute, he was in communication all the time and the house and bedroom are nice and clean.","10"
"Tres accueillant !","10"
"Very pleasant stay. The perfect location for the Olympic stadiums. Nice price. Spacious room. Warm. 

But the bathroom needs to be cleaned more often. It smells bad a bit.","10"

"Good location and welcoming host","10"
"Aurelien welcomed us very warmly. He waited for us and gave us good recommendations the night we arrived.
The apartment was clean, good for 2 persons who spent a few days in Montreal.","10"
"It was a great experience. The access to the apartment was simple and convenient allowing us to be flexible with our time. The place is very nice, functional with all one might need for a comfortable stay. Free parking on the street. There are restaurants, cafes and shops near by as well as Jean Talon market with fresh produce and great selection of cheeses.
The communication with the host was easy, constructive and positive. I already recommended it to a friend and I would definitely stay there again.","9"
"L’appartement était propre et bien situé (près du marché Jean Talon), on a trouvé un espace de stationnement sur la rue et on était proche des transports en commun. L’appartement était équipé de tout ce qu’on avait de besoin pour passer un beau séjour. La communication avec Geneviève était bonne et efficace. ","9"
"Nice, cozy and centrally located condo. Exactly like the picture. Genevieve was responsive and everything went smoothly.","9"
"This place is a must stay. Place makes you welcome. Beautiful apartment. Bed was real comfortable. Stay in this place if you're into art. I would stay here again without thinking twice. Unfortunately we didn't get to stay here much because my girlfriend and I were out and about.  Host was on point! Highly recommend","9"
"We had a wonderful stay at Geneviève's beautiful condo. The kitchen was fully stocked and the dishwasher was a nice bonus since we cooked a couple meals, and the bathroom was perfect (loved the rainfall shower head!). We hit the snooze button a few times because their bed was super comfortable. And once we woke up we enjoyed an espresso from their machine on the patio deck. One night we connected our computer to their tv via HDMI and enjoyed a movie.  The wifi was also strong allowing us to use it outside on the patio or front porch. We loved the neighbourhood too because it's close to Jean Talon Market and practically every street has a bike path so we biked everywhere (you can rent scooters and ebikes at Dyad to get around faster). There are a bunch of parks nearby, and Little Italy, Rue St. Denis, Mont Royal and Mile X are a short bike ride or walk away. We also found parking on the street right in front of the house without issue. Geneviève was a great host too. She was very responsive. The key exchange was easy since she left the key in a lockbox (much safer than the usual mailbox method). And she wrote down a bunch of amazing restaurant suggestions that we tried... They were amazing! 

Don't hesitate - a fantastic stay awaits you!","9"
"Nous avons passés un super moment chez Geneviève! Le logement est bien placé, proche du métro et des échoppes et est également décoré avec goût. Nous avions tout ce qu'il nous fallait à disposition. Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de la rencontrer mais les indications laissées étaient claires et nous n'avons eu besoin de rien de plus. Bref, je vous le conseille! :)","9"
"Can't say enough about how easy it was to book this place. Easy to find, flatbook was incredibly accommodating and responsive. The place looks just like the pictures. It is clean, with everything you need for a weekend trip. ","9"
"The host was on time and very pleasant. The flat was very clean and as described. The neighbourhood was extremely quiet although very close to great shops, restaurants, parks and downtown.","9"
"The location and apartment were perfect! We loved the cleanliness and coziness of the entire place. Shane contacted us directly the morning upon arrival, he was professional and helpful and provided all information we needed. We do wish that our unit had air conditioning as we felt very hot and muggy through out the night.
Great experience overall!","9"
"Flatbook hospitality team did a great job with frequent emails and follow-ups to make sure we were greeted at the home. We were running late, so they shared the key code for the main door. The home was nicely maintained, fresh linens on the beds and towels and toiletries were provided. There were 3 queen beds and a twin day bed which was more that enough for our party of 6. Living room was small, but that was fine, since we were out most of the day. The place is in a great location, walking distance to the main walking streets and restaurants (st. Laurent blvd, st. Denis, etc.).

The area does remain rather active late into the night, so there's street noise coming in (people talking/shouting, police cars, etc.) to the unit if you leave the windows open at night. There's no central air (we were there in the summer), but fans were provided in every room. It was still fairly hot inside with the windows open. 

Overall the stay was pleasant, location is great. Parking is not provided, you have to go to the closest main street (Sherbook st) to find parking for the day/night.","9"
"Comfortable, modern, clean, well-equipped place to stay for our family of four. Great location, with lots of restaurants, shops, etc. in easy walking distance. All the fixtures and appliances are new and in very good condition. Would absolutely stay here again.

Note that the apartment is on the second floor, accessed by an exterior metal curved staircase.","9"
"Great place for our group of four.  Excellent location, close to restaurants, depanneurs, patisseries and all the good stuff you can find in Montreal.  Apartment is as advertised, attractive, comfortable, clean, well equipped, nice linens and towels. Flatbook people are very helpful.  Would definitely book it again.  ","9"
"Great place. Enough space for all the people. However, the front stairs were a bit on the precarious side (steep and not entirely sturdy). ","9"
"This apartment was perfect for our party of four. There were four small bedrooms, each with a comfy bed (three queen beds and one twin), and the living room area was perfect for a rest after a long day exploring the city. Boulevard Saint-Laurent is just a block over and has a ton of nice cafes, restaurants, and bars, and the Vieux-Port is a 20-30 minute walk from the apartment. The area seemed to get pretty crowded with a teenage party crowd on the Friday and Saturday nights we were there, which made the two front bedrooms a little noisy as their windows face the street.

The Flatbook team was very responsive and organized. They got in touch with me right away to exchange details and to make sure all was arranged before our arrival. The apartment was clean, and the Flatbook guidebook that was provided was a nice resource. Overall, a great stay. Thank you!","9"
"The apartment was as described. Flatbook gave us plenty of supplies like shampoo, extra kleenex, etc. Everything was clean and nice like you would expect at a hotel. We were pleased with our experience and would stay here again.","9"
"Adresse à recommander! quartier hyper sympa, charmant, commerçant, à pied ou à vélo!  appartement très propre, fonctionnel, très calme, convivial. Escalier d'accès extérieur un peu raide.  L'équipe de Flatbook aux petits soins. Très bonne première expérience avec Airbnb!","9"
"We booked a flatbook apartment a month before our trip to Montreal. We chose that specific apartment because it has four separate bedrooms for the four of us and because of the proximity to the McGill university. The problem was that there was not hot water in the shower!!! In the Canadian weather of -2 to 10 degrees it did not make any sense to us. We asked for it to be repaired and although they tried it did not change at all. We were offered to move to different apartment but the apartments that were offered were not as close to the university and had only 3 bedrooms. We do want to mention that in all other aspects the apartment was great and flatbook also helped us get a big taxi to go the the airport. But at last we had a week of cold showers which made a really bad experience to us overall. When we book an apartment that is a basic thing that we expect.
","9"
"This apartment was great. It was just as advertised, very clean, and for the most part well-equipped. Its location was absolutely perfect. It is right in the heart of the plateau and an easy walk to Parc Mont Royale, Ave. St. Denis, Ave. St. Laurent, and even to McGill University. A truly central location.
The heat in the main room did not work when we arrived in the evening but Flatbook was very responsive and it was fixed by mid-day the next day. 
This is a great apartment for a group who needs several bedrooms. The key code entry was also wonderful as we did not need to share a key. People could come and go.","9"
"Great place! Fantastic location. This space was perfect for our family who needed space. The steps are steep (and icy in winter) so be careful.","9"
"The Flatbook team was excellent in accommodating us. The place was very clean and was well equipped with the necessities of a weekend stay. There was issues with the heating at the beginning which was quickly resolved and any request was answered and satisfied by the Flatbook team. Very close to the downtown life and attractions. Amazing and comforting for the 6 of us that stayed here.","9"
"Everything was great with the booking! Nice and tidy place and no surprises.","9"
"Place was well kept and ready on time. Only issues were no cable tv, the water in shower would not get hot, and parking could sometimes be difficult on street. ","9"
"Overall positive experience, however there were some complications post-checkout. Just make sure to inspect the apartment and take photos of anything that may not look right, and be sure to leave the apartment spotless at checkout. ","9"
"I travelled to Montreal and stayed in Flatbook with 5 friends. It was PERFECT! Best location. Super comfortable. When I return to Montreal, I would definitely stay here again! The Flatbook team was very helpful. Thank you!","9"
"Great location and a nice place - perfect for a weekend in Montreal!","9"
"I was in Montreal with my lab group for a biomaterials conference. The flat is cute and in a safe neighborhood near McGill and the convention center. It was fantastic! Everything was new and very clean. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.","9"
"Great location! Very helpful host. The apt was neat and orderly. Only small downside was the living room had no direct sunlight, but was still cozy to hang out in.
Overall a great place to stay for 3-4 people.","9"
"O apartamento é uma graça e bastante confortável! Quando chegamos, estava tudo limpo e arrumado e ainda tinha alguns mimos, como geladinhos no freezer. A localização é muito boa! Acesso fácil e rápido a diversos restaurantes na Rue st. denis. Ficamos entre a old Montreal e a zona comercial. Excelente estada. Recomendo!!!","9"
"Apartment seemed small for the price, but worked out just fine for our close-knit family of six.","9"
"Everything was done right which was expected.","9"
"Check in was very easy with a keypad entry.  The room was as described.  There were a few things that were not perfect: lamps with no good location to plug them in, and a dining chair that looked whole but had obviously been broken before.  None of it was enough to be a real problem.  

We had hot water in the shower, AC, a washing machine that worked (and detergent packets) four cute little bedrooms, and a kitchen.  The kitchen had enough pots and pans to cook a feast, a blender, a toaster, and a coffee maker.  It was so convenient and easy with the kids.  I loved that there wasn't a lot of stuff in it.

It was easy to walk to the train, restaurants, and shops.  We found free street parking.

If we were to go back, I would be happy to go back to this place.","9"
"The apartament had great locación, amazing deco, and was very clean. Amazing experience... I will stay here if O come back.  ","9"
"the location is good. There are many restaurants around house.","9"
"Great space for our family of 5. Clean and very comfortable. Within 3 blocks of subway, but we walked everywhere including Old Montreal, Chinatown, Notre Dame Basilica, and Miles End.","9"
"This was a very nice spot to stay if you are looking to be near downtown. Quiet street but very close to lots of restaurants and activities.","9"
"Lovely apartment in an excellent location close to great restaurants, bars and shopping!","9"
"I had experienced an issue with the AC, and the team was prompt to send someone over to provide us with fans and help resolve our concerns. The apartment is as described and the location was great to busy restaurant filled streets! The sheets were comfy, and overall we enjoyed our stay. Thank you Sonder! The","9"
"The apartment was very nice and in an awesome location. It was clean and comfortable. The only downside was that the air conditioning was broken so the nights were a little hot. There were ample fans though and the neighborhood was safe enough for us to sleep with the windows open. Amazing bars and restaurants were easily walkable and the city bike station was only a block or so away.","9"
"This place is right in the middle of an amazing area. Alot of food and clubs are literally 10 steps around the corner. Easily walkable to everything and the bikes. If your driving parking is right outside perfectly available every day and night. There are a lot of fans. The air-conditioning at that time wasn't working but it's okay. Great 4 rooms for 4 buds. Great area it was worth every penny.","9"
"L'appartement est bien situé et très propre. Il est proche d'un appartement hôtel en terme de présentation. Les chambres sont confortables et la salle de bain contient une grande douche. L'unique point à améliorer reste pour nous la luminosité de la pièce à vivre qui reste sombre même en pleine journée.","9"
"The location of this place was great and generally a close walk to attractions, food, and entertainment. There was just no heads up about the no air conditioning situation from the time of booking (when it indicated there is A/C) to check-in and we noticed how hot it was. The fans provided were okay despite the few days we stayed were especially hot and often times, it was hotter inside than out making the 6 of us quite uncomfortable at night even when we shut off all the lights except the lamp to cool down. Overall it was good place to stay for groups with the amount of bedrooms and is accessible to a lot of places by foot.","9"
"The flat is in a very lively area( but street quiet) and an easy walk for all areas. It had some nice shops and places to eat nearby. We could park in the street. The flat is very hot as mentioned in other reviews and the fans didn't really help. There is little natural light in the flat and not possible for air to circulate.  Only two bedrooms have windows to open.","9"
"I recommend this apartment, good experience","9"
"Great location and easy checkin.  Sonder was very responsive to questions weeks before.","9"
"Place is in a great location, and the check in check out process was very smooth and easy! Worth noting that two of four bedrooms do not have windows.","9"
"As advertised, clean and host went above and beyond.","9"
"Our stay at our Sonder was very pleasant. Check-in was easy and communication with the team was very prompt and informative. Location was perfect!","9"
"The apartment has everything a traveler will need. Location is very good and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The apartment is at a second floor and sometimes there are some noise from the people who live in the third floor but nothing that could really disturb us.","9"
"Le logement est très bien placé et fonctionnel.
Un peu de bruit les soirs du jeudi au samedi à cause de la fête du côté de Prince-Arthur.
Super communication avec Sonder.","9"
"Great location. Location and apt are Bohemian, lots of students, just around the corner from a great pedestrian street. Endless fantastic restaurants within a short walk.","9"
"très bien placé, bonne literie et propre, seuls bemols: manque de luminosité et de chaises pour 6 personnes","9"
"Great location, very good communication.","9"
"Good place with ok value but had trouble communicating with the host since this is run by a company, not a private host. Late checkout, even by an hour, was difficult to arrange and did not end up happening.","9"
"Great place,
Better then expected and good location. 
Not pictured is a decent sized entry.
However I did not like that I had to sign up for another online rental website called ""Sonder"" in order to book this place through Airbnb.","9"
"Les atouts: Appartement propre et pratique pour un court séjour. Déco minimaliste type ikéa mais efficace et bien chauffé. Literie confortable. Quartier central très agréable, calme et proche des commerces et du métro.
Les points faibles : Manque de lumière naturelle (photos du site un peu trompeuses sur la luminosité). Porte d’entrée pas très sécurisée et certainement à revoir.","9"
"Really great neighbourhood. The beds are also really comfy. Slept like a baby!","9"
"Great location, comfortable living area spacious rooms, no AC but they provide enough fans, overall gets the job done ! Would stay again","9"
"It is a nice apartment with a good atmosphere in a great neighbourhood full of lively restaurants and bars. Recommendable!","9"
"L'appartement est très sombre et l'environnement bruyant (rue et immeuble).
Il y a la TV mais sans aucun branchement à une box internet donc celle-ci ne marche pas (juste un câble Hdmi qui pend).
Aucun contact avec l'hôte, il s'agit plutôt d'une société qui gère plusieurs appartements, juste un code délivré pour accéder à l'appartement.","9"
"Great location.  This is not really Bohemian  but it is a very functional for a larger group that each gets a bedroom. It was terrific for six of us.  The refrigerator made a large noise but hopefully they will fix it.  All in all, a wonderful place to stay in a fantastic neighborhood.","9"
"Very good!","9"
"Great spot.","9"
"Our host was very helpful in accommodating our group for the weekend. We were able to cook, clean, and do our laundry with ease. The best part about the property is the location - walking distance from restaurants , grocery stores , and nightlife. Would gladly stay at this property again.","9"
"Nice place in close proximity to St-Laurent Street.","9"
"Tres bel appartement, les images refletent la réalité. On se croirait dans un appart VIP. 
Annie est un hote super, disponible et sait mettre ses invités dans des conditions de séjour optimales. Ns n'avons manqué de rien. De plus l'appartement est situé en plein coeur d'un endroit animé le soir. Je recommande fortement son appartement. Vs ne serez pas déçu.","10"
"Annie has been very responsive and very helpful. Her apartment is very nice and I love the place where it is located. A very creative and changing area, with all what we needed. Organic vegetarian food around the corner, groceries and fresh fruit and vegetable store, few nice cheap restaurant and bars. Early open breakfast dinners. Bookshops and bakery. Bike rental stations very close as well as metro and bus station. Perfect location for us. ","10"
"Annie was great to us! The place was super clean. She was very accommodating and it had everything we could have needed. Annie was very easy to work with regarding check in and out times. The apartment is very close to good food and the metro station. Thank you for making our time in Montreal that much more enjoyable!","10"
"This appartement was really nice and huge, and Simplissimo was great. 
Everything was ready when I arrived. No hassle everything was easy. Also the air-conditioning was turned on, the internet speed was fast everything needed was there. Great location close to St Catherines with all the shops. I would really recommend this place and Simplissimo too.

Cheers","9"
"Simplissimmo was helpful and accommodating throughout my stay, and the apartment was excellent. The space was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. The closest metro stop was only a short walk away, so it was easy to make use of Montreal's wonderful public transit system. Simplissimmo made my stay in Montreal simple, comfortable, and relaxing. I can't recommend this apartment enough.","9"
"The apartment was wonderful, clean, and had everything we needed. The listing description was completely accurate. The location was excellent. It was less than a 5 minute walk to all of the sites/attractions in Old Montreal and was near great restaurants and bars. The instructions for checking in/getting keys were very clear. We are very happy that we stayed here!","9"
"Great place. Exactly as picture is shown. Amazing location!","9"
"Unfortunately, this is my first bad experience on airbnb. I would not go through this ""host"" again as it was not a host who owned the unit but rather a large corporate housing company posing as the owner. They ran multiple units throughout the city it turns out. This is not the welcoming airbnb model and felt as such. When we tried to reach the ""host"" we had no replies via airbnb or the numbers provided until 24 hours after we tried to make contact. We had a snow storm that delayed our arrival and when we tried to communicate this to the host we never even heard back from her, making for a very stressful experience while on the road. The unit itself was very simple and clean but felt more like a cold abandoned studio apartment than a welcoming and warm stay, especially for the price we expected much more. ","9"
"Great location!  Enjoyed the ability to get on the subway or grab a BIXI bike right out the front door.  Has a wonderful French bakery around the corner and easy to walk to numerous restaurants.  Wonderful stay and arranging key pickup/drop-off was incredibly simple.","9"
"Great location and comfortable bed.  The fireplace does not work so a little disappointed.  For a long stay bring your own washing powder as there is only enough provided for 2 loads unless you call them and pay for more.","9"
"location was great, value was great, just wish the check-in was smoother. it's a company that handles multiple airbnb's so your apartment might look a little different than the one in the pictures but same layout. communication was good, there is a phone number you can call and through email we got quick responses. would stay again here again.","9"
"The hosts are awesome and have a great place for couples or 2 ppl. It is a nice art studio, simple and it is near everything. We didn't have to take a cab or uber anywhere. We walked through ""The Village""  which is where this is located and we had tons of cafes, bars, restaurants and shopping options. It is close to everything that a 20min walk would take you to down town Montreal and the old port as well. 

This was a great place to stay at. We kept our car parked in front of it for 3 days and no one complained. I would stay there again for sure.","9"
"Anastasia was a great host, really easy to talk to when arranging the reservation and flexible to meet up with us on our own schedule. The listing was exactly as described, and we love the neighborhood (Plateau). The bed is a futon which I didn't notice originally, but it was comfortable either way. We would definitely like to stay here again. Merci beaucoup! ","9"
"The studio is on a quiet street in a lively neighbourhood, great cafes and restaurants nearby. Anastasia's brother let us in. Everything was as described. Really lovely, cozy place, sparkling clean and spacious. Would definitely stay again!","9"
"We had a very nice experience here and would return. Valentin was warm and welcoming. The place was very clean and well decorated. The neighbourhood is very close to a lot of spots in Montreal! Overall, we're very happy with our stay! Thank you :)","9"

"This is a bright, beautiful studio space, in a great location. Close to restaurants, shops, cafes, and the mountain. Well stocked kitchen if you are eating in. Clean and artistically decorated. The host was welcoming and flexible with a rival and departure. I love this apartment and would stay there again. ","9"
"Anastasia a été très gentille et très accueillante. Son studio est bien décoré et tel que sur les photos. Un excellent pied à terre pour un couple qui souhaite découvrir Montreal. Tout prêt du métro, vous pouvez découvrir les restaurants des alentours ou faire quelques stations pour visiter le reste de la ville. Je vous le recommande.","9"

"Anna is a Great host. The property is fully Equipped and is in A great location.   Just that we felt a bit uncomfortable at night  on the sofa bed.","9"
"Ana was a good host. The apartment is clean.
Bed is too small but there is an air mattress alternative. 
It would be nice if there was some curtains to make the place darker at night. ","9"
"This was a beautiful, bright space in a great location!","9"
"Anastasia was accommodating when it came to our arrival -- we were later than expected, and had experienced cellphone issues when entering Canada, and she was willing to delay her plans for the evening until we arrived soundly. The place was minimal in the best of ways: clean, bright, well-equipped (except for not featuring an actual bed with mattress-- although that should come as no surprise, assuming you actually *read* the listing details), and we found the shower to be more than satisfactory.","9"
"Ana was a wonderful host! Everything was as shown in the pictures/description. The apartment is perfectly located, and allowed us to walk around the city without worrying about travel!","9"
"Parfait petit pied à terre très, très bien situé en plein cœur de Montréal. 

Le studio est spacieux, lumineux et aménagé avec grand goût et le futon équipé en lit très confortable pour une personne, probablement un peu étroit pour un couple par contre. 

L'endroit fut idéal pour un weekend de rencontres et de projets créatifs à avancer... le genre de très chouette endroit où je me verrais très bien habiter plein temps. Points bonis pour l'excellent album de Led Zeppelin sur la bibliothèque :)

Bien que très vivant, le quartier est étonnamment tranquille considérant sa disposition très centrale (à deux pas du coin Mont-Royal/St-Denis). L'endroit est suffisamment insonorisé pour passer une nuit confortable, les grandes vitrines avant auront cependant  tôt fait de servir de réveil-matin une fois le soleil levé. 

Ana est une hôte tout à fait charmante, accueillante et facile à rejoindre et propose un endroit que où je n'hésiterai pas à revenir lors de mes prochains séjours à Montréal!","9"
"I'm glad I stayed at this apartment during my vacation in Montreal. Anastasia was a very gracious host. She gave me plenty of tips about where to go and what to do and she was very good about responding to my questions. The neighborhood is a very unique one- close to bars and restaurants and full of life. Anastasia was also very accommodating with my rather early check-out time.","9"
"Everything was very pleasant, Great Communication and nice appartment in the middle of the plateau. Bed a bit small but place very nice and clean. Would come back again !","9"
"Great great location. apartment is really nice and clean.
5' walk from all services, metro and 10' from the Parc du Mont Royal.
Anastasia was really helpfull and available though a late arrival on friday night.
highly recommend this place !!

"Le studio est comme indiqué clair, lumineux et spacieux. La rue calme et le métro à proximité en font un lieu parfait pour visiter Montréal.

Ana is a very nice and accommodating host and a very sweet person.

The studio is very well located, clean, charming and, if you don't mind sleeping on a futon (I don't, it's actually comfortable enough), it is a very nice place to stay if you want to spend time in Montreal.

"A very cute apartment located on street level in the heart of the Plateau Mont Royal. The place was very clean and is a nice place to stay during a quick trip. The bathroom is great and everything is very close. 

Note that the bed is a futon, so it's better for one person than two! Also the kitchen is not equipped with items for cooking, so it's better if you are planning on eating out (which you should in Montreal). ","9"

"Le logement est parfait pour un séjour découverte de Montréal. J'y étais en voyages d'affaires, la proximité des transport en commun et des restaurants c'était bien, par contre, il fait clair (même la nuit) et comme c'est tout près de la rue c'était un petit peu bruyant.  Ce n'était pas insupportable, mais si vous avez le sommeil léger, c'est mieux d'amener un masque de nuit et des bouchons pour les oreilles. 

Anastasia a été très disponible et flexible, et répondait rapidement à mes questions par textos. Une hôte idéale! C'est un logement très moderne et j'ai beaucoup apprécié mon séjour. ","9"
"Anastasia's place was absolutely perfect for our trip to Montreal.  The location in the Plateau could not have been better--just a block and half from St. Denis and a short walk from Av. Mount-Royal.  The studio is so thoughtfully set up and designed, and Ana's style is super fun and inspiring.  The futon bed was perfectly comfortable.  And on a warm night the breeze from the window above the bed was great.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat! ","9"
"A+ Location. Would definitely stay here in the future","9"
"We loved Anastasia's stylish apartment in the gorgeous Plateau area and would have happily stayed there forever. Anastasia was extremely accommodating and very helpful throughout out stay. Merci beaucoup!","9"
"The apartment was beautiful, and in a great location! Anastasia was very friendly and answered all of my questions promptly. I really enjoyed my stay.

Just a heads up that as other reviewers mentioned, the bed/futon is quite hard, although Anastasia has put a mattress pad down. It's fine for a short stay but you may want to consider bringing memory foam if you're staying longer.","9"
"Studio parfaitement situé, au calme: au cœur du Plateau Mont-Royal, que nous avons adoré et à deux minutes du métro qui amène au Vieux Port.
Le studio est confortable, seul petit bémol: l'absence totale de stores devant les grandes baies vitrées très lumineuses... sympa la journée mais réveil aux aurores garanti!","9"
"Anastasia's place is in a superb location that is close to the Metro as well as plenty of restaurants and cafes. 
She is very responsive and accommodating as a host","9"
"Really cool little studio apartment in a fantastic location for accessing the Plateau and Mile End. Only a block away from the Metro. We found the futon to be very comfortable, but travellers looking for a proper bed might not. Would definitely stay here again.","9"
"This place was cute and is definitely an art studio. It is in a great part of the city! Anastasia said it might get a little loud at night due to the location but we had no problems. Anastasia was very thorough with checkout procedures and helpful with any questions we had about the area. We thought the bed was very comfortable and had everything we needed. There is a nice radio that we used every day and kitchen items for cooking. Would recommend!","9"
"Anastasia's studio was bright and cosy. It is in an awesome location and close to lots of great bars and restaurants. I would stay here again next time I'm in Montreal. Thank you! :)","9"
"It s basically ok.","9"
"Full of character and centrally located; Ana was extremely responsive, which was particularly important as my flight was delayed. Thank you!","9"
"Appartamento delizioso! La zona in cui è ubicato affaccia proprio sul Plateau e, volendo, si può sempre restare in zona a mangiare o bere qualcosa. La referente Anastasia è stata precisissima e disponibilissima. Se hai un auto sei praticamente a 10 minuti da ovunque indicato in una guida Lonely Planet di Montréal. Lo consiglio vivamente a tutti.","9"
"Great stay! The way it is decorated and the level of cleanliness makes it feel like a boutique hotel. It was very easy to communicate and coordinate with her. Will stay again :)","9"
"Great place! Loved it! Will stay again!","9"
"Wonderful little studio in a very convenient area - super close to the metro and lots of stores and restaurants nearby. The cleanliness, natural light, and decor make for a relaxing and inspiring atmosphere. It's street level so you often hear people or cars coming by, and there's light from the street lamps at night, but none of that stopped me from having the best sleep I've had in ages (that bed is really comfy!). Anastasia is a great host - very friendly and communicative, and I'd love to stay here again!","9"
"Very cool open plan apartment in a hip area, comfortable bed and walking distance to restaurants and bars. The subway is a couple of blocks away. Check in was effortless, I would stay here again.","9"
"Awesome apartment at a great location. The apartment is just as you see in the pictures. We felt straight at home! Wish we could have stayed longer.","9"
"I really enjoyed my stay. The loft is beautiful and in a great area. Anastasia was a great host and was very communicative and understanding when I was having issues with my phone. I would definitely stay here again.","9"
"Amazing place to stay in. Extremely clean and the neighbourhood is really metro, can't have picked a better place to stay","9"
"Anastasia's place was stylish and in the perfect neighbourhood for exploring Montreal. We were able to walk everywhere on foot and there were Metro stations right nearby as well. We would definitely recommend this place for any travellers looking to discover the city while living in an authentic local neighbourhood! Thanks again!","9"
"Great place in a great location.","9"
"Great Place to stay in Montreal.","9"
"Beau Logement bien situé, près de tout, bien décoré et lumineux. Stationnement plus ou moins évident. Cuisine équipé de base. Sommes tout ce fut bien parfait pour notre court séjour à Montréal!","9"
"Fantastic location in the heart of le plateau. A clean, bright and comfortable studio with futon bed. Easy access and great communications from a charming host. Slightly noisy evening traffic on Friday and Saturday due to the great location.","9"
"Magnifique petit appartement, bien équipé et très propre. Vraiment bien situé. Communications très faciles avec Anastasia. J’y retournerai sans hésitation!","9"
"The location is great...the apartment is comfortable and clean...I would definitely recommend staying here and would definitely stay here again! Anastasia is a wonderful host and was very quick to respond to messages.","9"
"My stay at Anastasia's place was absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed the spacious studio which is very centrally located - a short walk to mont royal and a block from the very frequent Montreal subway. Anastasia was very responsive and helpful throughout and I'ld definitely recommend friends to stay at her place as well.","9"
"I had a lovely time at Anastasia's ultra-hip, yet comfortable apartment in the Plateau, one of Montreal's best neighbourhoods. The space is beautiful with lots of natural light and is very spacious. So close to the Metro (3-minute walk) it was perfect for my short stay. Big beautiful windows let in lots of light, so do bring a sleep mask if you're used to sleeping in total darkness. One of the best designed places I've stayed thus far - a pleasure to spend time in. Anastasia was very responsive and easily reachable. Want to feel like a real Montrealer? Stay at Anastasia's!","9"
"Anastasia’s place was very fun and hip! It’s in a great location and you can walk to almost anything. My friend and I had a great weekend stay.","9"
"I had a great stay at Anastasia's lovely, bright and open apartment. It's new, uber-clean and tastefully decorated. The front windows are all opaque so may not be the best place for anyone who needs to sleep with blackout blinds (I personally really liked the the light :) ). Would definitely recommend.","9"
"The studio was clean and in a great location for exploring the restaurants and shops in the plateau. We had a great stay. Would definitely stay here again.","9"
"Anastasia’s apartment is not only clean and comfortable, it’s also close to many great shops and restaurants. It’s only a short walk to the metro, too. Anastasia was easily reachable through text and quick to respond. Loved staying here.","9"
"The flat is very tastefully decorated, and is in an excellent location. Anastasia is flexible and communicates very, very clearly, promptly and fully. This made getting in and out very stress free. Thank you and I would highly recommend your place in the future.","9"
"This studio was exactly what I needed for a long weekend in Montreal. The space is clean and stylish while still being warm and hospitable. The large frosted street level windows were lovely light and definitely added a cool factor.  I can see how large street level windows might not be for everyone - but I really liked them. The proximity to the metro was very convenient but not always necessary as there is so much to see and do within close walking distance of the apartment. 

Anastasia was very responsive and a great host.","9"
"Emplacement super pour accéder rapidement au métro et profiter de la vie culturelle du Plateau. J'ai été étonné par l'agencement spacieux et design de cet intérieur coquet. Parfait pour un couple ou un voyageur seul qui aurait besoin d'un pied à terre. Seul bémol, les grandes baies vitrées qui laissent passer la lumière des éclairages de nuit et la lumière du jour. Dans mon cas ça n'a posé aucun problème mais je sais que de nombreux voyageurs auraient eu leur nuit écourtée par ce détail.","9"
"Super appartement situé au coeur d'un quartier vivant. L'accueil et la communication avec Anastasia ont été parfait. Très bon choix !","9"
"Anatasia was fantastic and quick to respond to any questions I had!","9"
"Loved staying in Anastasia’s studio! It was super cozy and perfect for a solo traveler like me. There was a small convenience store right at the corner and tons of shops and restaurants that are a short walking distance away. Communication was easy and i didn’t have any issues with parking on the street for the two days i was there! Would def recommend!","9"
"Anastasia's place looked like the photos: clean, stylish, and homely. It's located right in the middle of one of Montreal's best neighborhoods. Anastasia was very quick to respond to any questions and was extremely helpful. I would definitely book her place again!","9"
"Cool place! Stylish art studio, good size for 1-2 people. Host very easy to reach and accomodating, would stay again!","9"
"Anastasia's place is an incredibly stylish and unique get away located within walking distance of a number of great bars, restaurants, cafes, and stores. The space is open and welcoming with large opaque windows and plenty of natural light. Anastasia is easy to reach and responds in a very timely manner if you have any questions or need recommendations. While freezing in the outside, the place stays nice and warm throughout each room which was a big plus for us, non-Montreal-natives. There are plenty of kitchen supplies and utensils, but they can be hard to find as the home has a very 'lived-in' feel and layout. Also, there is no TV, which wasn't an issue, but thought it should be mentioned (luckily there was a speaker with an aux to play some music). The shower can be a little tricky to get the right temperature and the shower door doesn't close fully (wasn't kidding when I said the space is 'open'). But, all of these minor details aside, this space is unlike any other airbnb or hotel you could find and it is absolutely worth staying in.","9"
"Cute, quiet space close to amenities and the metro.","9"
"Anastasia was very sweet and kind! Her place was very clean and it was at a very convenient location!","9"
"Great location, close to a lot of amenities and very clean! Was a great place to stay for the weekend.","9"
"Le studio d'Anastasia est idéalement situé sur le plateau, à 3 mn à pied de la station de métro Mont-Royal et de tous les commerces. La déco est design et très sympa. Il est très propre, bien équipé, très lumineux (ne pas oublier le masque pour dormir car il n'y a pas de rideaux ni de volets), très agréable, idéal pour 1 ou 2 personnes. Anastasia est une hôte très agréable, très réactive et très arrangeante. Elle trouve toujours une solution. Je ne manquerai pas d'y retourner lors de mon prochain séjour à Montréal et je le recommande vivement.","9"
"Very cute place to stay in Montreal","9"
"Anastasia's studio was an absolute pleasure to stay in. The neighborhood was an excellent central location in Le Plateau, with tons of retail shops, cafes, bars and restaurants to explore. The apartment was immaculate, and the bed much more comfortable than expected!

Anastasia was extremely communicative, providing quick and clearclear instructions for entry and check-out. I will be sure to see if this studio is available if I ever find myself back in Montreal!","9"
"Anastasia's studio was perfect for our stay in Montreal. Only a short walk from the Mont-Royal subway stop, which takes you right downtown, the studio is conveniently located in the Plateau, with short walks to some of the cities best neighbourhoods and streets, like Mile End, Laurier-Est and Boul St Laurent. Anastasia was quick to communicate with us, and we appreciated her flexible check-out times which worked so well with our flights. Just a note to future guests that the bed is a futon with a mattress pad, which we weren't expecting. It was a little small for my boyfriend and I and one side had a bit of a bump where the futon folded down which wasn't particularly comfortable to sleep on. That, and the fact that there were no coverings on the large windows (as indicated in the photos) would make it a little difficult for a sensitive sleeper, so I would recommend bringing a sleeping mask if the light at night bothers you as this is an open concept space and everything (aside from the washroom, which was great) is in one space. That was the one thing that was a little misleading about the studio, but otherwise, it was a great space to chill out in after adventuring around the city all day. Thanks for having us Anastasia!","9"
"great location - easy check-in and out - communication was good.","9"
"Fantastic place in a great location! Easy access to metro and just about everything else in Montreal.","9"
"Beautiful little space - charming decor and really clean. Everything was on your doorstep. It also felt very safe, but for lighter sleepers it might be advisable to bring earplugs and a dark mask.","9"
"Anastasia's place was the most perfect getaway for a quick trip to Montreal. It shines with warmth and intimate details that really make the place feel like yours. She was an extremely communicative host, checkin and checkout were seamless.

Thank you, Anastasia.","9"
"A fantastic little studio in a very convenient location. A lovely relaxing space to chill and work. 
Light sleepers will benefit from ear plugs and a eye mask.","9"
"Le studio d'Anastasia est vraiment très beau et bien situé sur le Plateau, proche de toutes les commodités. Il était vraiment très facile de communiquer avec Anastasia, elle était toujours présente en cas de besoin. Je recommande vraiment cet appartement!","9"
"Everything was perfect! Loved the space.","9"
"Anastasia’s apartment is lovely! It’s very stylish and in an ideal location- close to many restaurants and cafes. The only complaint we had was the bed- the bed is a futon and not a mattress so it was not very comfortable to sleep on.","9"
"The apartment was really stylish, incredibly convenient, and in a really fun area. It would be a great place to stay for one or two people max. I had a wonderful time there and definitely recommend it!","9"
"Anastasia's place was exactly as pictured! I really enjoyed the openess of it, and it's very convenient location. She was a super great host, incredibly easy check in and would definitely want to stay again.","9"
"The apartment is great and in an amazing location. The only ""problem"" was that the bed is a futon so it wasn't as comfortable. However, if you like to sleep in very dark rooms, this might not be the place for as it does not have curtains. That didn't bother me at all. Anastasia was very nice, accommodating, and responsive. I would definitely stay there again.","9"

"A nice, street-level studio apartment that is well-maintained and in a great location to walk to St. Denis, parks, and more! Nice, double-lock entryway right on the street. 

Note: This home is *genuine* Airbnb! Some Airbnb properties are permanent investments--the owner rents their property full time. This is not the case here-- Anastasia's home is clearly a part-time art studio and home, which makes it personal. The home is astonishingly clean and well maintained! But tourists who expect a sterile, empty hotel-room experience should look elsewhere. Also note that window treatments do not allow you to ""black-out"" the space, so if you need total dark to sleep you should look elsewhere. 

Otherwise, come and enjoy a classy, stylish little home! Great, instant communication from the host. Wonderful Indian restaurant and playground one block south. Easy walk to Chocolates de Chloe, Fruiterie  Plateau, Mamie Clafoutis, Park La Fontaine, and other Montreal favorites. Go get hibiscus ice cream at Cremerie Meu Meu! Very close to Mont-Royal metro stop for a quick ride to Old Port, Museums, etc.","9"
"Easy communication with Anastasia to get into the apartment, and the neighborhood is nice.","9"
"Appartement très fonctionnel et surtout tres bien placé dans un super quartier. Ideal pour découvrir la ville","9"
"Nice, simple and clean place, with a great location and access to local sights and public transit. ","9"
"I stayed at Anastasia’s lovely art studio for two nights while visiting friends. The location is BRILLIANT: so close to the metro, and so many great places to eat and drink. The apartment, as expected, is a studio space on the ground floor with frosted glass rather than curtains. Everything is beautifully done but, as other reviewers suggest, an eye mask is definitely recommended! ","9"
"Unique studio in the heart of a cool neighborhood.  Anastasia was a great communicator/host and I truly enjoyed my stay.  Would book again.","9"
"Anastasia’s place was the absolute best choice we could have made for a place to stay in Montreal! It was spotless, decorated beautifully, and had everything we needed and more! The neighborhood was walkable, and close to transit. Check in and out was so easy and Anastasia was great with communication! We truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely choose to stay here next time!","9"
"Anastasia is a very good host. Communication was easy.","9"
"Super endroit, au milieu d'un des plus beaux quartiers de Montréal. Loft équipé de base, mais très beau. Le lit-futon est préférable pour une personne. J'y retournerais si j'étais en vacances, mais pas pour un voyage d'affaires. La rue est à l'occasion assez bruyante avec les touristes qui circulent dans la rue.","9"
"Great flat in a great location (very close to Subway station Mont Royal). Anastasia was nice, precise and very helpful. The only (very small) negative point was that there are no curtains on the big windows, so bring your sleeping mask. Other than that, perfect! Would recommend 100% to anyone visiting Montreal. ","9"
"This is a very “hip” studio in a very trendy part of town. It is spacious and very clean. Like other reviewers, the street noise (voices, cars, late night revellers) are very loud, so it might not be the place for you if you aren’t a sound sleeper.  The big windows also lets in lots of light, so a sleep mask or an early start might be necessary. We also had a difficult time finding parking (came in on a Friday). The street signs were confusing (en francais), but once we found one it was free and good for the whole weekend!!  It’s a very lovely spot, but depending on your needs and lifestyle (eg. you’re an old insomniac like me), it might not be a great fit.","9"
"Nous recommandons ce studio pour son emplacement, et son état neuf. Anastasia est vraiment très disponible et réactive.  Nous avons passé un super séjour dans ce studio.","9"
"Anastasia has a beautiful apartment! Very confortable, clean and perfectly located. Besides, she was very attentive and replied quickly to my questions and requests. I recommend this apartment without any doubt!","9"
"Very stylish place located in a great neighborhood with great restaurants and shops, all within walking distance from Mont Royal, the old centre and Mile End, another lively neighborhood. Anastasia was very responsive and helpful. If one thing I would say the bed isn't the most comfortable bed I slept on. Other than that, it was a great place to stay for a long week-end in Montreal.","9"
"I really enjoyed to stay at Anastasia's place. The place is same as pictures and location is also great to commute. The place was perfect for me while I can take a rest and enjoyed the city of Montreal. The place would not be an ideal place, if you are a light sleeper.","9"
"周边有些吵闹,不利于休息｡","9"
"Great location in Montreal, very intimate but central to the surrounding neighborhoods full of life. Also very stylish interior decor. It will make you relaxed to be in.","9"
"Anastasia's place could not be in a more perfect location- only about 2 blocks to the metro, in the heart of the plateau's best restaurants. Parking in the area is really tough (outside of Sat & Sun where there is limited street parking in front of the apartment). Apartment was clean and bright and spacious for a studio. Thanks for the great stay! Would stay again next time we're in town!","9"
"Anastasia was very gracious in letting me arrive early. I really love this neighborhood and this studio is a great base to explore from.","9"
"This was a great place to stay in Montreal, and loved the location as it was easily accessible to the Metro (which takes you to the airport and downtown), close walking distance to St. Denis/awesome coffee shops and shopping, and a very sweet place. Looks exactly as listed in the pictures. I am a light sleeper, but in general had no issues with sleeping as some previous reviews have suggested (there is a fan to help with background noise). Would definitely recommend!","9"
"Terrific location and a really nice space. Easy check-in/out so you can focus on enjoying Montreal!","9"
"Great apartment, great location, very clean. Easy to find and good value, would recommend","9"
"This is my second time at Anastasia's place and it was exactly as I remembered it! Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a comfortable place to stay near Mont-Royal","9"
"Absolutely perfect location!","9"
"Clean, modern work studio in a great location. Bed is also a folding sofa, but fine. Not really any places to lounge other than on the bed, but space itself is quite comfortable. As others have mentioned, space can’t be made totally dark, but we didn’t find that an issue. Very convenient location, near Metro.","9"
"Staying at Anastasia's place makes it different. Great host and great location, 100% recommended to every person visiting Montreal!","9"
"Anastasia's space worked out very well for my two night stay. The location is central and interior artfully done. I'd definitely stay again. She let me keep my bags at the space after check out which really helped! Definitely recommend.","9"
"Super séjour dans ce très joli appartement du plateau mont-royal. Je recommande.","9"
"This space was very clean and in a good part of the city. There were very minimal amenities - no tea, coffee, dishes in any of the cupboards (all were left in the dishwasher). We also found it got quite cold and the heating takes a while to kick in. The space is beautiful, check in easy, and Anastasia was a good communicator. This place really is a studio and not really designed well to accommodate sleepers. The bed is a somewhat comfortable futon and there is a tonne of light at night through the wall of windows facing a semi-busy street. If the futon was a more comfortable pull out couch and there were curtains over the windows, this would be a great Airbnb. It suited me fine for 2 nights but I was happy to return to a real bed!","9"
"This location is absolutely wonderful! It is next to a number of boutique shops and the food around there is great. Getting around town is very easy because the location is a 3 minute walk from the metro. Anastasia's place is extraordinarily clean and the studio is decorated very well. Super great value!","9"
"Anastasia’s place is very nice and centrally located. A couple of details could be improved, though: we found the bed to be a little too small for two, and not extremely comfortable. Also the heating made a noise that was distracting, especially at night when trying to sleep. Perhaps add some blinds to make it darker for sleeping too? Other than that, great place!","9"
"This is a very cool space in a nice area that’s fun to walk around in and close enough to other interesting parts of Montreal.","9"
"Great place to stay in the Plateau-Mont-Royal! Very clean and stylish!","9"
"The location is perfect. Close to tons of nice restaurants and subway. Easy to go all places. And the space is quite unique. Really like the plants","9"
"Beautiful place and Anastasia really took great care of me.","9"
"Excellente réactivité et disponibilité d'Anastasia. Tout était parfait.","9"
"Great location and clean and stylish space.","9"
"Great communication, beautiful, inspired space with everything you need in downtown Montreal. Close to restaurants and public transit. Can't wait to stay again in the near future and visit Au Pied du Cochon. (If you haven't been there.... go there)","9"
"I had a wonderful stay at Anastasia's stylish little (Website hidden by Airbnb) has endearing personal touches and happy plants! The location is amazing...right near great restaurants and shopping...
Anastasia was always easy to reach, generous and helpful. A true treasure for the price.","9"
"Perfect location, cozy artistic spot. Very clean, cant wait to stay here again!","9"
"William à été très disponible, même s'il n'a pas pu être présent le jour de notre arrivée il nous a laissé tout ce sont nous avions besoin. L'appartement est très fonctionnel et très sympa. Il est très bien situé, à quelques minutes du métro et des commerces. Idéal pour un sejour à Montréal! Merci pour tout William !","10"
"William was a great host throughout the entire experience. He was there to greet us upon arrival and was easy to contact during our stay. He provided us with some info on the public transit, a list of his favorite spots, and some great music too! The apartment is simple, neat, and clean with plenty of amenities. It is located in a quintessential Montreal Neighborhood with manageable parking around the corner. Be sure not to park right in front (Hutchinson), it is resident only and we got a parking ticket within 20 minutes because it's parking-by-permit only. Around the corner there is pay by space parking and some other free spots. We used Uber and our car to get around but the metro is close and seems very manageable. William is great resource for anything you may need to know about the area.","10"

"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"L'appartement était très bien, équiper de tout ce qu'il faut, au moindre problème je pouvais contacter William.

Très heureux d'y avoir été","10"
"For short or long stays, I highly recommend this apartment. You feel as though you live like the locals, and it has everything you would need. The bed is comfortable and there's plenty of space for lounging. 

It's a short walk to the metro, and easy to car share to. Good option. ","10"
"We had a great experience at William's place.  His apartment is steps from a centrally located subway stop (and grocery store - bonus!), yet very quiet and safe.  I am a light sleeper and was surprised at how quiet it (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was great from the moment I tried to book.  There was a glitch on Airbnb's side and William worked with them to correct the problem within a few hours.  I never had to wait long for a response to any of my questions.  I even had a few over the holidays while he was traveling, and he replied quickly!  If you're looking for a well-located, tidy, cozy apartment with a comfy bed, stocked kitchen and plenty of room for two, this is your place.  I plan to visit Montreal again soon (I hope!) and I would not seek a different spot to stay unless I had to!  ","10"
"Very clean and quiet place near the downtown area. Fantastic for 1-2 people looking to explore Montreal!","10"
"William is a great host and his home was perfect for our stay. I would recommend staying here!","10"
"Localização excelente. Ao lado da Notre Dame e da Montreal antiga. Em frente ao Palais de congress. Para dias frios existe acesso rápido para o RESO que leva até o centro Desjardins onde há um mercado. Fomos em um casal com um bebê. Apartamento super equipado. Sentimos falta apenas de um sofá para o fim do dia.","9"
"Uncomplicated way to get the keys at the welcome desk near the Appartement. Alejandro was fast in responding if we had questions. Parking possible in-house for a reasonable price. The Appartement was really clean and bright and had everything from pans to chopping board ... The location is perfect for visiting old Montréal.
Unfortunately the bed was a bit hard and shaky, if someone turns around and you could hear the fridge and air condition during nighttime.
Despite these two things, we really enjoyed our stay in Montréal.
","9"
"Loved the place and it's location. Very close to everything.","9"
"This place made our stay in Montreal beyond perfect. What a perfect location and such a great experience. 
Highly recommend! ","9"
"Great apartment/suite in a perfect location on the edge of Old Montreal, walking distance to both downtown, Notre Dame, and all other sights in Old Montreal. There was a Metro stop literally 2-3 minutes away, which was convenient for getting nearly anywhere else in the city. 

The apartment itself was clean, spacious, and comfortable. It looked and felt like a hotel suite (was even in the Embassy Suites building, I believe). 18th floor with a nice view of Mont Royal (could see the cross out of our window). Gym on site and onsite underground parking available (though at an additional charge of $30/day). Laundry in the apartment was an added benefit. 

Alejandro was responsive leading up to the trip and very friendly. It was a bit harder to reach him during our stay, but he works with a company (Corporate Stays) that was reachable during their business hours, and Corporate Stays was able to assist with any of our questions/concerns.

Though the apartment is a bit pricey, I thought the location was excellent and the space was comfortable. Thanks Alejandro and Corporate Stays!","9"
"Stayed there for a month, perfect location in Old Montreal, close to everything you need especially the metro station. The place had an hotel feel to it and view was great (I was on the 20th floor). I had some issues with the WiFi but they give you a number to call for customers service and issue was quickly fixed.","9"
"Managed by a corporate rental company. Key pick up is at another location 7 min walk away. They request photo ID for keys. Building is primarily short term rentals. 2 minute walk to Notre Dame, Metro. Great location.  Unit was clean. Front door was off its hinges so hard to open close. Kitchen Cabinet hinges also broken. Bathtub turns into a swimming pool after 2 min. No microwave. Wifi didn't work. Layout is like a 600sq/ft condo. Great space. Clean appliances, Good cable package. King sized bed. Lots of pillows, very quiet at night. Location, Location, Location! Would go back and hope the bathtub was unclogged. :)","9"
"Richard habite à côté ... Très pratique pour nous accueillir dans cet endroit tranquille, on se sent vraiment à la campagne en plein cœur de Montreal... 

À conseiller ...","10"
"Excellent experience. The apartment was very clean and even better than the photos. Just 2 blocks off of Saint Catherine in a perfect location. Richard was a great host, very quick to reply to all of my questions and inquiries. Will definitely re-book. Thanks again. ","10"
"Richard est un hôte extraordinaire, sans aucun doute notre meilleure expérience Airbnb. Nous n'avons qu'un seul regret, ne pas avoir pu profiter plus longtemps de sa jolie location et de son accueil incomparable. Sa maison est située dans une petite rue très agréable, elle est spacieuse pour un couple et joliment décorée. Nous recommandons les yeux fermés !","10"
"Une nuit mais une nuit mémorable dans ce petit coin de paradis au milieu de la ville. Justement on l'oubliait celle-là!","10"
"I was really happy with the rental.  The apartment was clean and modern and looked just like the photos. The kitchen is fantastic and there is also a BBQ outside.  This would be a great rental for a couple that enjoy grabbing food from local market and preparing meals.  The apartment is located on a one way laneway that has little to zero traffic. The apartment is a 3-5 minute walk away from the gay village.  There is an amazing brunch place called Le Passe Compose that is mere steps away from the apartment that I would highly recommend guest checking out.","10"
"Richard met us with a warm reception, and a few cold ones in the fridge!  The pictures of the house accurately showed the current state of the inside and backyard of the home-beautiful!  Unfortunately,  the cleanliness of the house was not as good as I had anticipated, considering the fee I paid for cleaning expenses.  I had to wash the inside of the fridge, the kitchen counters and bathroom, and the upstairs floors.  The main level floor was dirty as well, but we just kept our shoes on during our stay.  We were disapointed there was no air conditioning and only 2 windows had screens to let in cool air at night.  The patio doors did not have screen doors either. We recommend installing a ceiling fan above the bed, however there were 2 small fans that came with the unit that we utilized. The neighbourhood itself was sketchy-we watched homeless people change their clothes and a druggie shoot up in the parkette situated across from the house.  In spite of the negatives, the house is completely modern and beautiful inside-you would never know the house was originally built in the 1800s!  Richard used wood from the old house for the new renovations that add wonderful charm to the updated kitchen and living room.  The kitchen was a dream to cook and eat in and it had everything that we needed (except a microwave, but not crucial).  The bathroom was huge and we especially loved the large luxurious spa shower.  The area was surprisingly very quiet so we had no troubles sleeping.  Perhaps the characters in the park were one-offs.   You would be hard pressed to find such a spacious, modern and beautiful home with a covered deck and lovely backyard in the middle of the city.","10"
"Our host was fantastic! Richard was available and very communicative. The place was a great location and spacious. The reclaimed barn wood touches were beautiful. Wonderful place overall.","10"
"Overall a fantastic experience and wonderful place to stay while visiting Montreal.  Our hosts were both friendly and eager to answer any questions we have, and the apartment is gorgeous.  It's completely redone and 100% matches the pictures online. We also loved the location of the apartment, just two blocks from a metro stop on a peaceful and quiet side street right next to a small city park. Overall we loved the stay and would absolutely rebook the next time we are visiting Montreal. ","10"
"We had such a wonderful experience from start to finish. Richard and his family are lovely hosts who genuinely made us feel welcomed. You cannot beat the location. There are 2 metro stations within 5 minutes walking distance. Located in the village, there is a thriving nightlife and restaurant scene 2 blocks away. The home itself is clean, modern, yet cozy all at the same time. We loved the backyard area and the small park just steps from the front door. It's so nice to have outdoor space on vacation! I would, without hesitation, recommend this place. This was our first airbnb experience, and it exceeded our expectations. Richard is so kind and accommodating and the condo itself was the perfect spot. I'm so glad we did this and we would stay here again in a second. ","10"
"Richard was great! We arrived a little early but he was able to take ours bags and recommend a little coffee shop for us to go to while he just finished up cleaning inside! The house is really beautiful, has had a lot of work put into and it shows! Communication was easy and I would definitely recommend staying here! ","10"
"Richard a été un excellent hôte. L'appartement est impeccable, moderne et très bien équipée. L'emplacement est parfait, sur une rue extrêmement tranquille, malgré la proximité du centre-ville. Nous recommandons chaudement l'appartement de Richard et nous y retournerons certainement.","10"
"We booked at the last minute and Richard was very accommodating and responsive to our needs. Richard's place is walking distance to many restaurants, bars, coffee joints, etc... We truly enjoyed our stay and would gladly recommend it for visitors to the area.","10"
"This was the best experience for me. Not only the place is beautiful comfortable and in a great location but also Richard the host was super attentive and communicative before and during my stay. 

I arrived during a heatwave in Montreal and the place had no AC upon my arrival but, within an hour Richard went and got an AC unit! Incredible. Highly recommended you won't find a better place.
","10"
"la maison est superbe, le petit jardin un coin de paradis!
Le lit est très confortable, nous avons passé une très bonne nuit.
Richard à été très accueillant, nous avions 2 bières au frais qui nous attendaient: super attention!
Petit Bémol: le quartier. Nous sommes restés qu'une nuit et peut-être était-ce exceptionnel mais la rue n'était pas très tranquille.
À recommander!","10"
"Richard was very welcoming and responded quickly to any communication that I had. The house was comfortable, clean, and cozy. The location was very convenient; the house is one block from the closest metro station (Beaudry) which is one station from a main transit hub (Berri-UQAM). This allows for easy access to many parts of the city. Also, within two blocks, there is a grocery store that has a mixture of fresh food/produce and was more than enough to keep us well stocked during our stay. Definitely would come back during future visits to Montreal.","10"
"Richard's apartment is a fantastic place to stay when visiting Montréal, we had so much fun! The location is perfect, very close to the Metro, as well as many shops, restaurants and bars. It is set back from the main street so the avenue is quiet. We were able to find free street parking nearby, and then we walked everywhere. 

The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Richard provided everything we could need, the washer & dryer were a nice bonus. It is also nice to have a private backyard for relaxing, especially in the beautiful summer weather. 

Richard was quick to communicate and very flexible. Our arrival time was pushed back and he made it easy to contact him and check into the apartment. 

If you are looking for accommodations in Le Village, Richard's apartment is a great choice! ","10"
"Richard was a gracious host. He has a beautiful place on a beautiful street. Great quiet backyard. Will definitely stay here again when visiting!","10"
"Wow! Superbe appartement! Il est très bien situé et très propre. Richard est très accueillant et disponible. Il y avait 2 bières froide au frigo à notre arrivée, une très belle attention. 

Merci ","10"
"Lovely place that was very well equipped with amenities and in an ideal location. Highly recommend!","10"
"The house was absolutely wonderful. Very cute, had everything I needed, done/designed very nicely, and most importantly it was extremely clean from top to bottom.  Richard was very helpful prior to my arrival and during my stay with providing suggestions and he's quick to respond via email.  The street is very cute and quiet.  I would definitely stay here again. ","10"
"Richard is a wonderful host! He took the time to explain the features of the house and recommended good places to eat, to visit, to see.  The house is just perfect!  I felt like home! So comfy, perfectly clean, the backyard is so nice and I fell in love with that cute little street.  Everything is around by walking distance:  convenient store, grocery, drugstore, subway, restaurants, etc.  I recommend that house to everyone and I will come back again!  ","10"
"Richard est un hôte très disponible et accueillant. Tout est fait pour que l'on se sente bein accueilli, une bière nous attend à notre arrivée. Il n'a pas hésité à nous donner des conseils afin de visiter et découvrir Montréal.
Le logement est très bien situé dans Montréal, pour une première visite de la ville c'est un bon point de départ.
Le logement correspond en tout point aux photos, fonctionnel et bien équipé. 
C'est un bon rapport qualité prix au vu des prestations de l'appartement.

je recommande ce logement aux personnes qui comme moi ne connaissent pas Montréal et souhaite découvrir cette Ville. ","10"
"Could not recommend this stay enough. Everything about the house is exceptional. Brand new kitchen, bathroom, living space, beautiful backyard. Added to the fact that it's located on one of the nicest streets in the heart of a metropolitan city like Montreal. We actually cancelled other plans we had our night here so we could spend time in the space. Marie greeted us warmly, like family, and helped us learn the ins and outs of the house. Can't wait to return again. ","10"
"We had a wonderful time at Richard's house! He is a great host and was very responsive throughout the process. His wife was there to welcome us and show the house and the neighborhood for the best place to park.
The location is great, there are stores nearby but it's set off the main street and very quiet, we especially enjoyed the backyard with the covered deck. The house was very clean and modern, exactly like the photos, the bathroom was very roomy with a luxurious spa shower. Richard and his wife were very welcoming and attentive and made us feel at home, I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend!","10"
"For a second time it was PERFECT!   I will come back soon and I highly recommend this wonderful place!","10"
"Hôtes tout simplement adorables ! Quartier très animé . Appartement parfait bien, super bien équipé, au calme dans une petite rue. Tout est à proximité. Métro à 5 min ! ","10"

"Si vous rechercher un lieu de séjour très confortable calme et bien situé près du centre de Montréal pour un séjour à deux, alors c'est celui-ci qu'il vous faut. En prime un hôte fort sympathique vous accueillera.","10"
"We loved this home in Montreal. Spacious, clean, airy, beautiful. We want to live there!! The detail of Richard's renovation is just amazing. He was there to make sure our arrival was smooth; and we had no problems. 

The address adds to the apartment's charm. We were able to walk everywhere! And close by we discovered all that we needed for our stay.

Thank you Richard, we'll be back!

"The house was fantastic, well situated, modern and very cosy with all the amenities away from home. Richard and his partner were great hosts. I can't wait to come back next time.","10"
"Richard and Melanie were very friendly and welcoming. The apartment was perfect for my stay.","10"
"Cet appartement est impeccable et décoré avec soin et attention. La localisation est charmante dans une rue inusitée et permet un accès très rapide au centre-ville comme tel.

Comme Richard me l'avait indiqué, en fin de soirée, en réintégrant l'appartement j'ai pu facilement trouver une place de stationnement dans les rues environnantes.

Un séjour plus long m'aurait permis de bénéficier pleinement des commodités et attraits de cet appartement. Lorsque je retournerai à Montréal, je rechercherai l'appartement de Richard dont le rapport qualité/prix est excellent. À noter que  le statut de Superhost de Richard a joué dans ma décision de choisir son appartement.

We will love to visit again if the place is available","10"
"Superbe logement, accueil chaleureux, tranquillité remarquable, tout était parfait. À louer à nouveau!","10"
"This was my first AirBNB and Richard and his family set the bar pretty high. We were his first guests for the holidays... he and his family set up a Christmas tree and made ginger bread cookies for us! He also gave us the back story on his Airbnb which I won't spoil. The place is great. Super clean, quiet, great shower and all top of the line appliances. It's also near a lot of nice shops and eateries. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to get away for a weekend, explore Montreal or even a longer stay. If/when I visit Montreal again I'd pick this place for sure.","10"
"A great place to stay right in the heart of the Village ~ just steps away from the Metra station, restaurants and shops.  Richard was wonderful ~ he was there to greet us upon arrival and showed us around the house.  He was very responsive to all our questions before we arrived as well as gave us some great recommendations as to what to see & do in Montreal.  His house was beautiful, clean and even decorated with a Christmas tree for the holidays!  We would definitely stay here again the next time our travels bring us back to Montreal.","10"
"Richard's place was fantastic. Exactly as expected. Gorgeous and spacious. Heated floors were a particularly nice touch. Stay here!","10"
"Très bon séjour chez Richard ! Nous avons apprécié l'accueil et la gentillesse de nos hôtes ! La maison est magnifique et conforme aux photos ! Très bien situé, proche d'un métro et au centre de la ville, nous serions bien restés plus longtemps :) 
Merci encore à Richard et son épouse pour ce séjour très agréable ! Nous recommandons à 100% !","10"
"Great place! Richard's place was very spacious and modern. Richard's wife greeted us upon our arrival and went above and beyond helping us with suggestions of things to do/places to eat. The neighborhood is very quiet and we easily walked everywhere we needed to go. The shower is amazing, and I loved the heated flooring throughout the house. I recommend  this place to all! ","10"
"The apartment was perfect. Close to everything and we literally uber everywhere. Richard was so good at getting back to us and made us feel very at home.
The decor is amazing and very cozy place. 

For down time when we got back to the apartment we streamed a lot of music and played board games as there was No TV or Radio. 

It's defiantly a perfect getaway and we will be back for spring hopefully!

","10"
"Richard's place is fantastic! I can't recommend this unique home enough. My boyfriend and I stayed here during a trip to Montreal and our only wish was that we had more time to spend. The location is fantastic (in the heart of the city), the home is beautiful and you can really tell Richard cares about the little details, even the sheets in the bed were super soft and comfy. Above all, Richard gave us suggestions and even told us about the fantastic story of the historic home that he's remodeled into a truly gorgeous place. This has been one of our best, if not the best, Airbnb experience we've had. ","10"
"Ne ratez pas la maison de Richard !
Un havre de paix au cœur du quartier village de Montréal.
La maison vient d'être rénovée avec goût ; 
De plus Richard et son épouse on un réel sens de l'hospitalité.
Je conseille vivement cet hébergement.

"Richard et sa femme sont très accueillants et agréables, leur logement est super et idéalement situé dans Montréal!

"This place is great. So nicely renovated and there are a lot of little things that add to the experience. Richard lives right next door so check in was super quick and simple. Heated floors throughout, amazing shower, board games, and the bed!!!- oh, the bed. Probably 4 of the best sleeps I've had, ever. 
Very quiet, friendly neighborhood. Highly recommend. Thank you! ","10"
"Endroit très agréable et propre. Nous allons réserver de nouveau dans le futur!","10"
"Richard est un hôte très sympathique et avenant. La maison que nous lui avons louée est un vrai havre de tranquillité en plein cœur de Montréal. Nous avons adoré.","10"
"Richard was at the house doing some maintenance work when I arrived and was very friendly. The photos are all an accurate representation of the house. The kitchen is nice and roomy, though it could use a few more cooking utensils.

The location is nice and located on a very private side street/alleyway with one of the city's many tiny public parks across the street (think a few trees and a couple of benches). There will be virtually zero traffic outside your door. There are (French) guide books in the house that can point you in the right direction, if you're looking for something to do.

I stayed at Richard's place in February, and the heated concrete on the first floor was great. I would love to come back in the spring or summer and enjoy the quiet back yard, which would be perfect for a romantic picnic.

Overall, a great stay and I'd definitely recommend it.","10"
"We spent two nights in Richard’s apartment. We had a wonderful stay. The space was exactly as described in the webpage. The apartment is spacious, with every detail to make your stay incredible. Richard and his wife were gracious and welcoming.  We’d recommend their place to anyone visiting Montréal.","10"
"Richard was a warm and gracious host who met me at check-in to walk through his home and let me know he lives just next door. The pictures are accurate and the place is very clean and stylish with great working wifi. The 2-level single family home is on a pretty, very quiet, smaller street, just off great longer avenues (St. Catherine and Maisonueve) with bars, restaurants, shops and gyms in walking distance. I highly recommend this listing. Thanks Richard! ","10"
"Nice place","10"
"Richard was a kind and welcoming host. The apartment is in the heart of a very hip neighborhood, and it offers great access to all Montreal has to offer. ","10"
"Richard est très accueillant et disponible si besoin.
Appartement très sympa, bien décoré, calme et très bien situé. Un weekend très relaxant. Il ne manquait que le soleil pour profiter de la terrasse. À recommander.","10"
"Richard was a great host and the location was perfect!  Very nice space inside and loved having our own private backyard","10"
"This is a great home. Centrally located and walkable for most things. Very close to public transport and bixi stations also close by. We ate at a great sushi restaurant, Uchi, 7 minutes walk away. Also, ate brunch at Passé Compose just down the street, and highly rate it - just get there with plenty of time, the line up was out the door!
Bed very comfortable, and great water pressure in the shower. Lots of space to store clothes if having a longer stay.
Very pleasant stay, and would choose to stay here again.","10"
"Nous avons passer 15 jours magnifiques. Richard et sa femme sont prévenant et nous ont donné de bon conseils culinaires. La maison est génial dans un quartier génial. Petit mot pour nos cousins d'Amérique, vous êtes géniaux. ","10"
"We stayed in Montreal for the Grand Prix. Richard's place is well located near the Beaudry station ( like only 2 blocks). From there we connected to the Old Montreal and attractions. We did not have time to enjoy the place's deck and BBQ :) .  Richard was very attentive  to the check in and check out and made it easier for us. Thanks!","10"
"Richard and his wife are wonderful hosts. The house really was centralized in a great part of town. You literally have access to everything. Checking in and out was painless. The house is amazing. Richard did a wonderful job on the renovations. We would definitely stay again.","10"
"We had a great time staying at Richard's place and in Montreal in general. The place was quiet and comfortable, and we really enjoyed the back patio area. The only drawback was that the AC unit wasn't able to keep the room upstairs cold. ","10"

"Richard's place was great value. Really nice house in a great area. Highly recommend","10"
"Nous avons passés un excellent séjour chez Richard qui est un hôte extrêmement sympathique et très joignable! La maison est très agréable et extrêmement bien placée ! Tout se fait à pieds et le metro le plus proche est à 2min à pieds. Nous y reviendrons avec grand plaisir!! Merci pour tout Richard et à très bientôt. Kristel & Virginie","10"
"This place has an amazing location and yard! It is located on the cutest street in Montreal, right out of Paris. Parking wasn't too hard to find nearby even with many local roads closed when we were there. The backyard is definitely the highlight of this place! The whole apartment looks just like the pictures. 

The kitchen could use a few more items; if you plan on cooking you might want to bring a few of your own things including a knife (the one that was there wasn't great). If you come in the summer, and have room, brining a fan wouldn't hurt. There is AC but just in the upstairs bedroom.

Richard (the host) is a really cool guy, hopefully you get a chance to chat with him when you stay. We had an awesome time and would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Richards air B and B is in a central location. It was a 5-10 minute walk to transit, food, nightlife etc. It offered plenty of space and had everything we needed - There is an iron, lots of closet space, hair dryer, washer dryer onsite, AC, etc. lots of free street parking available. His location is on a small side street so you need to park a short distance away. Richard was responsive and check in a breeze!","10"
"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour. L'appartement était propre et le petit jardin idéal pour profiter du beau temps.","10"
"I can't say enough about Richard's place - although the pictures are accurate, I was surprised to find the space more lovely, more spacious and more comfortable than expected. The location is fabulous and the street that the house is on makes you feel like you're a world away from big city life. I would recommend Richard's place to anyone looking for a quiet and upscale retreat - yet still close to the village, the metro and everything else the city of Montreal has to offer. I hope to be back again - soon!","10"
"This is the best deal in town. Perfect central locatin in a charming quiet street. Richard's place is tastefully designed and súper cozy. Each year improves!","10"
"Super appartement, design et bien équipé situé à 5 minutes à pied du métro.","10"
"Great hidden quaint spot in the middle of everything we were looking for in Montreal.","10"
"Maison conforme aux photos donc magnifique. Très bien située et desservie. Nous avons adoré notre séjour mais aurions aimé rencontrer l'hôte ! Une prochaine fois :)","10"
"Richard's place is such a gem that I'm reluctant to share. It's exactly the kind of place I'd like to come home to every day. It's perfectly minimalist, with everything you need. It made me consider moving to Montréal.

The backyard is a real treat after a long day traipsing around the city (or a long drive from NYC) and there's a small park across from the front door. Ample, but competitive, parking on the streets. The shower has three heads and a detachment. Don't say I didn't warn you.

The bed was so comfortable that we overslept and were late getting back to New York. My only regret was not bringing my laundry. I had a lot of fun playing with the kitchen lights, too.","10"

"We really enjoyed our (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication, check-in/out were all swift and friendly. The space is well decorated and maintained on a quiet street in the Village. Easy walking distance to loads of restaurants, nightlife, and metro. 

Definitely a great space with a great host! Highly recommended!","10"
"매우 조용하고 편안해요. 다운타운까지 걸어서 20-30분 정도입니다. 저희는 걸어다니면서 동네구경하며 다녔어요. 시청도 가깝고 VIA Rail도 가깝고 노트르담성당도 가까워요. 그리고 집에 너무 깨끗해서 놀랐고 편안해서 좋았어요. 내 집처럼 딱 5일 묵다갔습니다. 정말 강추강추 합니다! (엄마가 너무 좋아하셨어요^^)","10"
"We loved Richard's place and found it much better than expected. The pictures do not do it justice. 
Parking was relatively easy on R. Panet, and we always found by Parc Raymond Blain. The location to the Gay Village is perfect being close enough to the bars and restaurants. The property is on a quiet street with no regular vehicular traffic.
We couldn't enjoy the backyard, but believe it would have been wonderful during the summer. The kitchen is stocked with essential sundries. 
We both left Montreal being in love with the city, and would definitely consider staying at Richard's place again.","10"
"Richard's little house is wonderful! It is stylishly decorated and has all the comforts and amenities of home. The location is close to everything. Communications and check-in were prompt and easy. We would be thrilled to stay at Richard's place again and highly recommend it to any future guests.","10"
"The place is as seen in the pictures and even a little better! It is a quiet neighborhood and close to everything. It is away from the hustle and bustle of St Catherine but close enough where you can be in the lively neighborhood in under 5 minutes. The space is spacious, welcoming, and just lovely. If you are not a city person though do not try to brave a car rental unless really really needed. Parking was tough to find at night. Besides this it was the perfect get away and the best place to stay!","10"
"Richard’s place is awesome. Very short walk to all the restaurants, bars and shops on St Catherine but located down a quaint quiet street. Apartment itself is modern and comfortable.  Terrace and balcony were great!  Check in/out was a breeze and Richard was very responsive.","10"
"Absolutely loved staying at Richard’s place!! The location is perfect for roaming around the village and easy access to metro! But it is also conveniently quiet off the busy street so you can get a nice rest! The space is beautiful and comfortable and has everything you will need! Beautiful kitchen, super private backyard, spacious bathroom, comfy bed and cute balcony off the bedroom! The place was super clean and had everything I needed for an amazing stay! Excellent value!!","10"
"Richard's house was so cute and cozy! Had plenty of space for 2 people and had all the ammenities necessary. It was also decorated so cute. It was easy to get to and was close to the train/bus stations so very easy to travel to/from. I would definitely stay here again when I am in Montreal!","10"
"This was perfect for us. Great, quiet location for a young couple. It was -8 degrees outside but nice and warm inside. We used the kitchen one night and they had everything we needed. Owners were very responsive. Would stay again.","10"
"Super logement. Aucune surprise, l'endroit était fidèle aux images. C'est spacieux, fonctionnel et propre. L'ajout d'une table serait peut-être le seul point à améliorer. Par contre, comme nous avons principalement mangé aux restaurants, ce n'était pas un problème pour nous.","10"
"The stay was great. It was a great location and Richard was very responsive. The property was a little rough around the edges and needed some cosmetic fixes, but it was easy to overlook as the property was stylish in general. The washer/dryer were convenient. We didn't grill, as we didn't have time and it was to dirty to use. If we come back to Montreal, which is likely, we will stay here again!","10"
"Great location. Apt is on a beautiful block filled with charm. Richard was a great communicator (fast and helpful). I totally recommend the place.","10"
"Excellent private room, very clean, modern.  Owner Richard  was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Would definitely do this again!","10"
"Great!","10"
"Richard's place was extremely clean, had a great backyard space, and was located in the perfect area. The kitchen was also stocked full with everything one needs so I did not feel the need to eat out for every meal. Highly recommended and would definitely stay here again!","10"
"Richard’s place was very hip and comfortable situated in an excellent neighborhood tucked away in a quiet lane way","10"
"This comfortable, clean apartment is on a quiet, one-way street with lots of character. It’s a peaceful little neighborhood but at the same time only a brief walk to Saint Catherine Street about a block away. 

The queen bed was comfortable with cozy bedding and plenty of pillows. The place can accommodate a family, but everyone has to sleep in the loft together. The loft itself is spacious, with a bathroom, an outside deck, and an air conditioner. The first floor has an open living room and large kitchen with a porch and small yard surrounded by a tall privacy fence. So although the apartment is not huge, it has many spaces within its boundaries. Very comfortable. 

Richard himself was always quick to respond to our every need. He reached out to us through Airbnb while we were on our way there to ensure a smooth self check-in and answered promptly each time we had a question. Also, I inadvertently left behind some valuables and he agreed to send them to me promptly through the mail. 

I highly recommend this place.","10"
"Excellent location just blocks from all of the action in the Gay Village and short walks to other major points of interest. It’s in a quiet alley tucked away across from a small park and boasts a lovely green yard and balcony to enjoy the sunshine and watch the birds and trees mingle. 

The house itself was lovely. The bottom floor has a generous kitchen with all the essentials and the living room is cozy and charming with lots of Montreal specific literature to browse thru. 

Upstairs the bed is comfortable, the bathroom is clean and stylish and as an added bonus you’ve got a solid washer and dryer that came in (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication between Richard and I was very smooth and clear. I will definitely stay here again!","10"
"Nous avons apprécié notre séjour dans cet appartement car les pièces sont grandes et il est situé dans une rue très calme. Le jardin est également un point fort. A partir de là, nous avons pu faire nos visites à pied ou en transport en commun. Merci.

"Stylish and comfortable space (the bed gave me a glorious night’s sleep) that was exactly as shown in the listing. Richard was quick to respond to any questions I had and was very friendly to speak with. This is a perfect spot for people looking to stay in the middle of the fun, while also wanting a quiet retreat to relax. I would definitely book again!","10"

"A great space to explore Montreal. We were biking through the city and it's conveniently located for easy access to bike routes. It was great to be on a quiet side street but so close to everything downtown.","10"
"We loved our stay in Montreal and Richard's house was perfect in terms of location, design and comfort. Richard was very friendly and helpful and the house had everything we needed. I was attending a conference at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth hotel during my stay and really enjoyed the half hour walk through the city each day. We'd definitely stay here again - thanks!","10"

"Spacious, comfortable home located near Gay Village with easy access to local transit, BIXI bike share, and plenty of safe street parking. Large, modern kitchen and private outdoor spaces add to the charm.","10"
"Such a great place! Richard was always very quick to respond and answer any questions. The place itself was awesome - super spacious, GREAT kitchen and backyard, awesome shower too.

"Le logement de Richard était parfait pour accommoder mes proches en visite. la tranquillité de la rue et la proximité du centre ville ont été particulièrement appréciées.","10"
"This place is located in a trendy area with lots of good restaurants to try out.  It’s also located perfectly for those who enjoy walking a bit to all the tourist attractions but for those who aren’t, there is metro stations very close by also. Richard’s place has plenty of space so that if you’re traveling with children it is also ideal with the two twin beds available.  It is nicely decorated and well kept.  I would definitely recommend it to others.","10"
"Un super séjour dans un appartement confortable et proche de la rue sainte Catherine! Merci à Richard pour sa réactivité. Nous recommandons son logement!","10"
"Richard's place is in a fantastic location, on a quiet side street adjacent to the Village and Old Montreal neighborhoods. A short walk to cafes, unique restaurants and night life made this the perfect spot for a weekend adventure. Private outdoor space would be fantastic if we were staying longer and wished to grill for dinner - next time! :)","10"
"Nice place with a private backyard, grill and balcony in the middle of the city. Ideal for a couple, alone or with 1-2 small children. Great washer and drier. Parking on the street may be hard to find, but with a bit of patience we always managed to find a spot less than 2 blocks away - be sure to learn about Montreal's parking signs as they can be quite confusing. Would surely come back!","10"
"Richard’s place is amazing. Such a cool layout in a great area. Feels like home away from home, highly recommended.","10"
"Fantastic, private space 2 blocks away from St Catherine's. On a quiet street, location is perfect if you plan to spend time in the Village. Half a block away from fantastic brunch spot (Passe Compose - go early or prepare to wait!). Home is very comfortable with a private yard and deck, large kitchen and comfortable couch. Bathroom floors are heated and shower is big. Bedroom linens and pillows should probably be replaced, along with the towels, but overall very accommodating. Communication and check in with host was very quick and easy. Home is on 2 levels (kitchen and dining room on 1st floor, bedroom and bathroom on 2nd).","10"
"Richards place is excellent, and could not ask for a better location.","10"
"This was a great place to stay. The place was advertised well and communication with the guest was great.","10"
"The host made me feel very welcome, and the apartment was very nice. The neighborhood was also very nice, and was located exactly where I needed to be within the city (I was there visiting a friend who lived closed by). ","9"
"Sarah was very nice and accommodating. She was available right away for any questions or concerns.","9"
"Isabela's apartment is great! I stayed there with more 5 friends and we really had a nice time in Montreal. It is well localized just a few minutes from the subway station. She was so kind and really helpfull with check in and check out hours. Definitely I recommend her apartment. Thank you Isabela!","10"
"Isabela was amazing! I did not get to meet her but she made she I had everything I needed, also made sure the apartment was warm and cozy! I would definitely recommend everyone to stay here, it is close to many places and she has some wicked cool CDs and board games!","10"
"Excellent experience! Isabela was very kind and accommodating. Communication was very easy. No problems were encountered.","10"
"Logement pas cher et très bien situé.","10"
"Très agréable séjour ! La localisation est parfaite pour un petit week end à Montréal ! Rapport qualité prix parfait ! Isabela très à l’écoute et aucun problème de communication !","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Great experience. Everything went well. All the essentials were provides. Guillame was really cool too.","10"
"Nous avons passé une semaine fantastique dans l'appartement de Valérie et Jean. On se sent immédiatement comme à la maison dans cet appartement super cosy, parfaitement propre et ou il y a tout ce qu'il faut et plus encore pour un séjour court comme pour un séjour plus long. Nous y retournerons sans hésiter une minute. Le quartier Hochelaga est vraiment sympa et vivant et est parfait pour explorer la ville. Enfin les Valérie et Jean sont très chaleureux et ont vraiment a coeur que le séjour soit parfait. ","10"
"My daughter and I had an excellent 3-night stay at Valerie’s apartment!  It was exactly what we were looking for, as we had tickets to an event at the arena within Olympic Park and wanted accommodation within walking distance.  One of the reasons we enjoy using Airbnb is to get to know local neighbourhoods of big cities, such as Montreal’s Maisonneuve. The apartment actually exceeded our expectations - it is as pictured and described; very well stocked with what we needed for a comfortable stay; we parked our car right in front and either walked or used public transport to get wherever we needed to go (Olympic Park – Biodome and Planetarium a short walk – and we took the Metro into the Montreal Old Town); appreciated the maps, tourist info and book with Valerie's personal recommendations of nearby restaurants, services, etc. including the nearby Maisonneuve Market.  After our busy days, it was great to come “home” to our classic “Montreal walk-up” apartment!  Merci Jean and Valerie!","10"
"This was my first airbnb experience and what an amazing one. Valerie and Jean were great hosts. The apartment itself was cozy, comfortable, very clean and had everything we needed. Cute balcony  which made me feel so relaxed and like I was away somewhere tropical. The apartment location is also great. Great restaraunts close by, convenience stores, a market, the metro, and other cool places to check out in Montreal like  Parc Île Jean Drapeau was a 15 min drive. Would give this 5 out 5 rating and highly recommend to others! ","10"
"My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay with Valerie and Jean. They were very accommodating to our early arrival time. The place was clean and comfortable to come back to after spending the days exploring the City. Montreal was great to visit. Also, one day we were able to rent a car and drive up to Quebec City. It was a couple hours drive, but it was well worth it. We also enjoyed checking out the nearby planetarium, botanical gardens, market, and Hoche Cafe. ","10"
"We had a nice visit - the apartment was very comfortable and relaxing, the setup was perfect for our 3 day visit and the nearby playground was an added bonus for our daughter!","10"
"Valerie's apartment was wonderful. Very clean and there were clear directions about the internet, etc. She also included information about the neighborhood. I was only their briefly and didn't get the chance  to meet her, but she was very flexible and able to accommodate my arrival and departure times.  ","10"
"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans l'appartement de Valérie et Jean. L'appartement est très bien situé (juste à côté du Biodôme et du métro), calme et propre. C'était parfait pour notre fin de séjour au Québec. Valérie est facilement joignable et a su répondre à toutes nos questions. Nous recommandons sans problème cet appartement ! Encore merci Valérie et Jean.","10"
"I booked for my parents. 
They were first time AirBnB users. 
They both agreed, ""We will do it again"". 
Thanks for the great experience. ","10"
"Merveilleux séjour dans un appart très confortable, propre et fonctionnel. Nos hôtes ont été à l'affût du moindre de nos besoins. Le calme du quartier et la proximité de tout en fait la combinaison parfaite. Hochelaga-Maisonneuve est devenue un arrondissement très à la mode et pleins de petites merveilles de restos, bars et magasins. Super expérience !","10"
"Nous avons été sensible au livret d'accueil et à ses recommandations ainsi qu'aux cartes de visites des bonnes adresses à découvrir dans le quartier. La rue est agréable, arborée et proche d'une artère commerciale. Le descriptif et les photos correspondaient en tout point à la réalité des lieux. Nous aurons plaisir à revenir chez Valérie et Jean pour un prochain séjour à Montréal.","10"
"Première expérience airbnb pour mes parents venus de France et ils ont adoré l'accueil de Valérie et son conjoint, des hôtes très chaleureux et discrets. Appartement propre et tout équipé (laveuse, sécheuse. etc.), très bien placé avec commerces et transport à proximité. Rue très calme, à recommander chaudement!","10"
"It was such a pleasure to stay with Jean and Valérie! The apartment is filled with just about everything you need, and is easily located right near the metro, making getting around such a breeze. My mother and I stayed here on a bit of a last minute notice and Jean and Valérie were very accommodating and attentive...highly recommend and would stay again!","10"
"Jean and Valerie were excellent hosts! The apartment was wonderful and had everything you might need, including a washer and dryer. They even included a book full of restaurant suggestions. They were very thoughtful hosts. It felt like a home away from home!","10"
"A return visit to Valerie and Jean’s – that should say it all! 
We were once again very pleased with the hospitality and the apartment itself – clean, comfortable, quiet and well-equipped with many thoughtful touches provided for guests.  Within walking distance of Olympic Park attractions and the Maisonneuve Marché and neighbourhood.  Convenient to drive to Montreal attractions or use public transit.  Highly recommend!","10"
"Both Naveen and I were very impressed with the apartment.  Everything was neat and clean.  The kitchen is well equipped.  The pictures are very accurate.  We would've enjoyed staying longer.    The location is perfect.  It is very close to the Botanical Garden (easy walking distance).  The Metro is located at the Garden as well, so getting downtown was very easy.  We parked our car, and used public transportation the whole weekend.  Ontario Street is a great place to check out (again, easy walking distance).  Valerie was wonderful.  We really appreciate all the extra touches she adds (books to read, maps of the city, guest book with details about nearby stores/restaurants).","10"
"Logement très agréable, confortable et reposant. Nous recherchions un petit coin de paix pour quelques jours et c'était un lieu idéal! ","10"
"We were greeted and made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived. We were given a tour of the apartment so that we felt comfortable and knew where to find everything.  Also there were notes with useful information as well. The apartment had everything we could possibly need and we felt right at home. 
","10"
"My wife and I had a great experience at this apartment. Close to the subway and a variety of restaurants and shops. Jean and Valerie are excellent hosts.  They made us feel welcome and we had no problems checking in and out.","10"
"My sister and I had a wonderful stay on Rue Sicard. Jean and Valerie were tremendously accommodating and very kind. The space was clean and the essentials were perfectly supplied. I thought the location was great as well and easy to get to and from other parts of Montreal.","10"
"I have stayed in several Airbnb apartments and this one was definitely a favorite!  The apartment is so cute and inviting and very clean.  It's obvious that Jean and Valerie care and want you to have a pleasant experience.  The market just a couple of blocks away is amazing. We really enjoyed buying some things for dinner and eating outside on the balcony. The subway is a short walk away, which makes traveling into the city very easy.  The neighborhood itself is quiet and friendly, and it's perfect if you are traveling by car since you can park right outside.","10"
"Studio agréable, propre, très bien équipé  et au calme.
Proche du parc olympique, à quelques minutes du métro pour se rendre dans le centre de Montréal
Accueilli par le propriétaire très sympathique
On se sentait ""comme à la maison"" Merci","10"
"Moi et mon mari à passé un week-end parfait ici pour notre deuxième anniveraire de mariage. Ce appartement était calme, nettoye et romantique. Valérie et Jean sont hostes très aimables, et encore mieux, ils nous donnent plus du temps pour quitter l'appartement à cause de notre train qui part a plus tard. J'adore Montréal, je sais je vais rétourner, et la prochaine fois, pour plus du temps! Merci à tous, Jean et Valérie, pour un vrai expérience Montréal.","10"
"A beautiful place to stay, just outside of old Montreal. The subway was a 5-10 minute walk away and was easy to find. It was another 5-10 minute ride into town, but it was great to get off at different stations and have a look round. Car parking was easy and we felt comfortable leaving the car out front.  The unit itself was clean and comfortable; the bed was so cosy. The only minor criticism, there was no aircon, but there are multiple fans which helps cool the unit down. Overall a great place to stay and I would recommend the unit to anyone wanting to visit Montreal. Thanks Valérie for being a great host.","10"
"Tres bonne experience. L'appartement est tout mignon et tres agreable. Nos hotes étaient egalement charmants. Tout était operationnel, bien organisé. Dommage que les vacances soient deja termines. Christelle & Arthur","10"
"Such a charming and delightful place! Very comfortable stay here. A little bit out of the city but very easy to get downtown on the metro. The guidebook was a lovely touch and very helpful. Would gladly stay again!","10"
"Jean was there to welcome us and Valerie introduced herself later. Directions were very clear.","10"
"Le logement de Valérie est parfait pour découvrir Montréal: très confortable, bien équipé il correspond exactement à l'annonce. Le quartier est calme, il y a de la place facilement pour garer la voiture et la station de métro est toute proche pour visiter la ville. Valérie et son mari sont sympathiques et vous conseilleront efficacement. Je recommande vivement Valérie et son appartement et j'espère avoir l'opportunité d'y retourner. Merci encore pour tout et peut-être à bientôt.","10"
"RAS","10"
"Great place to stay, we loved having a little space of our own to enjoy after wandering beautiful montreal! Easy to get around with transit and really well-kept apartment. Thanks for a lovely spot!","10"
"Valerie was very nice and had a beautiful apartment. The bed was extremely comfortable and our hosts provided lots of information about local sights and places to eat. 5 star hosts for sure","10"
"I had a great stay at Valérie and Jean's apartment. It was a perfect getaway - private, quiet, clean, and beautiful space. I'll would definitely stay here in the future!","10"
"My husband and I had a perfect stay in Valérie's apartment. The location is very convenient to get to the downtown area, and also features local amenities and charming restaurants. The apartment itself is wonderfully spacious yet cozy and comfortable. We would love to stay again and definitely recommend to anyone visiting Montreal!","10"
"L'appartement est bien situé, près du parc Olympique et d'une station de métro, très propre et bien équipé. Il correspond à la description et je le recommande.  ","10"
"Logement très accueillant et tranquille.","10"
"We spent a really nice week in Valerie's lovely apartment. Everything we needed to make our stay pleasant was provided and Valerie even suggested things to do/see in the city. Checking in/out was very uncomplicated.
Thank you! Merci beaucoup!
","10"
"My wife and I stayed for a week at Jean and Valérie's apartment. It was basic, but comfortable, homely and well equipped.

There's plenty of public transport close by so it's easy to get around the city.

If you're looking for a great value apartment as a base for exploring Montréal, this is an excellent choice!","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Quartier très calme. L'appartement est très bien conçu. Il ne manque rien. L'accueil est chaleureux. A recommander.","10"
"I cannot recommend Valerie and Jean strongly enough; they were the prefect hosts.  When my friend and I had travel issues/delays, Valerie was always very quick to reply to my updated messages regarding our changing schedule.  The apartment is perfect: very clean, cozy, small private balcony, comfy bed... really an ideal base from which to explore Montreal.  Although it's north of the city center there are lots of things to do/explore within walking distance of the apartment including the old Olympic Park and Botanical Gardens, plus, the Metro is about a 10 min walk so it's very easy to get anywhere else in the city.  This is an ideal, quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of downtown that still allows visitors to take advantage of all Montreal has to offer.","10"
"Valérie et Jean sont des hôtes absolument charmants, généreux et très arrangeants. Ils nous ont apporté d'excellents conseils pour l'organisation de notre séjour au Québec.  De plus, le logement est impeccable, propre, fonctionnel et surtout très bien situé. Parfait pour visiter la ville de Montréal et ses alentours tout en restant dans un endroit calme et apaisant. Merci encore!","10"
"Valérie et Jean sont des hôtes formidables, et ce fut un réel plaisir que de les rencontrer. De plus, leur logement est parfait, tout à fait conforme à l'annonce, très bien équipé et à quelques minutes a pied du parc Olympique. Le balcon est un réel plus. Nous le recommandons vivement !","10"
"We had a wonderful time at Valerie's place! The apartment is very comfortable, clean, and in a great location. We could walk to tons of restaurants and the metro was close by so we could be in the center of the city very quickly. Jean and Valerie were so nice and made a point to say hello and offer us tips and recommendations for the area. We tried out their recommended breakfast spot and it was great. We'd definitely recommend this place for your trip to Montreal.","10"
"Fantastic host, very friendly and prompt to reply to messages. Lovely apartment with everything you need and more. Perfect location for our trip as we were at the Olympic Park most days. Thank you.","10"
"Très bon appartement à quelques stations de métro du centre ville,  commerces à proximités, et stationnement possible, magnifique jardin botanique à proximité ainsi que le Biodôme. Nous avons été très bien accueillit par nos hôtes.","10"
"Valérie's place was absolutely wonderful for my wife and I's weekend getaway to Montreal. My only regret was spending so much time in the city and not in her apartment! The apartment was just as described, wonderfully clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Plenty of power outlets to charge my many camera batteries as well. While we didn't use it I loved that the kitchen was well supplied with all pots and pans you might need to cook yourself a nice dinner to eat on their lovely back porch. It's located within walking distance of many outstanding restaurants, Olympic Park, and the Metro for easy access to downtown Montreal. Easy parking on the street right outside as well! I'm already looking at my calendar to figure out when we can come back!","10"
"Valérie's place is great! The apartment is cozy and well appointed. It is also super clean and in a great location. I'd stay here again.","10"
"Valerie’s place was fantastic, we felt like home throughout our stay. Valerie welcomed us when we checked-in and was available throughout. The place has everything we needed and more, we will definitely be back again.","10"
"C'est la deuxième fois que je séjourne chez Valérie et je recommande ce logement. Il est bien situé, près d'une station de métro, du marché Maisonneuve et de la piscine olympique. L’accueil est chaleureux, l'appartement est propre et la cuisine est bien équipé.","10"
"Bons moments passés à Hochelaga chez Jean et Valérie. Quartier pas (encore) trop touristique et authentique. Les rues Ontario et St Catherine ont du charme avec  ces commerces divers et variés; la boulangerie, le saucissier et le biérologue, les divers bars/cafés et le beau marché couvert de Maisonneuve. Nous avons eu le plaisir d'avoir un week end où la neige est tombée à gros flocons rendant la rue avec tous ces escaliers et ses arbres, magnifique.
 Valérie et Jean ont un sens de l'accueil qui fait plaisir à ressentir avec ce mode de location, et on se dit, bien volontiers en partant que l'on aura plaisir à venir les revoir!!","10"
"Nous avons été bien accueillis. Un marché sympa est situé non loin du logement ainsi qu'un bon restaurant recommandé par nos hôtes.","10"
"Parfait, le logement est cosy, on se sent comme chez soi, l'endroit est calme, un peu à l'extérieur, mais bien désservi servi par le bus à 150 mètres et/ou le métro à 10 minutes. Valérie et Jean sont très sympathiques, nous vous les recommandons. Yves et Fabienne","10"
"Clean, calm and well situated apartment. Great hosts and a great value.","10"
"Amazing place and great communication with the host!!","10"
"Superbe séjour à Montréal dans votre appartement ! Le logement est parfaitement propre et bien équipé, on s'y sent comme à la maison. Merci pour l'accueil :)","10"
"Appartement très mignon, emplacement super proche métro viau et marché Maisonneuve. Hôtes très sympathiques et réactifs. Tout est parfait rien à dire !","10"
"Je recommande sans hesitation cet appartement. Il est très bien situé (métro, commerces, restaurants) dans un quartier agréable. L'appartement est très bien équipée et très propre. Les propriétaires ont été très réactifs et la communication très bonne et efficace.","10"
"L'appartement est très propre et exactement comme sur les photos.  Très bien organisé avec un petit manuel d'instruction et des recommandations de restaurants et boutiques du quartier.  N'hésitez pas à louer cet appartement, il est vraiment bien.","10"
"Valérie’s apartment is beautiful, cozy, and quiet. It's located in a very nice part of Montreal, close to Marche Maisonneuve and many restaurants, the metro is about a 7 minutes walk away. The kitchen is very well equipped and there is a washer and dryer. Thank you, Valérie and Jean for being perfect hosts!","10"
"Very good location. The host Karim was great with kindness. Nothing to complain and someone who enjoy tje city of Montreal, this place would be recommandable...very cozy.","9"
"L'appartement est très bien situé en centre ville à proximité de la station de metro Peel.  Karim a été très accueillant et flexible sur les heures d'arrivée et de départ. 
L'appartement est spacieux, très bien décoré, propre et donc très agréable. La chambre possède un très grand lit, nous avons pu facilement dormir à quatre dans l'appart (avec le canapé).  Une très belle vue sur la ville! Immeuble très bien sécurisé avec concierge à l'entrée. 
Parfait pour passer un court ou long moment à Montréal. ","9"
"Very accommodating and helpful host! Karim was very quick to answer to any questions. The apartment was very clean, had quite neighbors, and had the best location in downtown Montreal. The apartment was equipped with all necessary everyday use items. For sure will stay again here, when come back to visit Montreal!","9"
"Het was een prima appartement met veel ruimte en comfort; prima ligging voor ons, dichtbij congrescentrum en eetgelegenheden.","9"
"I stayed at Karim's place for one night with a work colleague. It's in a great location, with an easy walk to shops, restaurants and bars. Although one bedroom, the sofa is HUGE and as wide as a single bed anyway. 

The apartment was spotlessly clean, and Karim was extremely friendly and accommodating. He helped us out with several recommendations in the local area and replied to messages almost instantly. 

If I come to visit Montreal again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. ","9"
"This apartment is exactly as pictured and described. Do you want a  large, modern, well-equipped apartment in a great location? This is a prime choice. We were able to walk to some of Montreal's best restaurants, bars and shopping. The excellent Metro and bus system is very accessible. Karim is a charming and welcoming host. He responded promptly each time we contacted him. Also, he offered to act as a concierge , if needed, during our trip. The building is safe and secure and the quiet neighbors will allow a relaxing sleep in a large and comfortable bed. It was obvious the apartment had just been cleaned and the linens were freshly washed. The Wifi was fast and dependable and there was Netflix and Apple TV. The city views from the apartment are great and the rooftop terrace is even better.
We would highly recommend this listing, if a visit to Montreal is planned. ","9"
"Karim was an excellent host and made us feel right at home, not only at his apartment but in Montreal.  The apartment is great and what you see online is what you get; an excellent location, clean apartment and welcoming host.  Thanks again for a great stay!","9"
"The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Beautiful apartment and Ka is a super knowledgeable and accommodating host.","9"
"Great location, accurate pictures, safe building!! My friends and I were extremely comfortable in this beautiful apartment. It has an amazing balcony (with a table, two chairs, and some small outdoor lights) that provides a great view of quaint architecture below and lovely trees. Ka was extremely helpful and flexible when it came to our checkin and check out which I greatly appreciated since I was coming from the United States and was caught in border traffic. The building is extremely safe. Only thing to keep in mind is that currently your car must be 6'3 or shorter to fit in the garage. We found parking on the street since it was the weekend and had no issue. ","9"
"Good central apartment","9"
"Excellent location - close to Crescent Street and Mount Royal; best for couples","9"
"Everything about this apartment worked well for us. The host was friendly and helpful and went out of his way to drop off a second key and let us store our luggage on our last day. The location was perfect for my conference a couple of blocks away. We loved the balcony and the TV set up. The bed was very firm -- best if you like that in a bed. The only downside -- a previous guest had left something in the fridge that had gone bad and left a pretty unpleasant odor -- was pretty easy to deal with.","9"
"We were very very happy with this booking, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this apartment.  The host, Karim, is a delightful young man who is hospitable, respectful and very able—thus, a great host.

We stayed here with two elderly people, and their comfort was of utmost importance to us.  We therefore had a lot of questions prior to booking the apartment and before our arrival.  Karim was prompt in his replies and diligent in his answers. Everything went smoothly and according to plan. 

The apartment was clean and in tip-top shape when we checked in.  One thing we loved was the bathroom, which was very spacious—offering not only a bathtub, but also a shower.  The kitchen was clean and aptly equipped, which was nice.  Nice big couches as well!  Being a high-rise building, the view was also great.  This is a relatively small apartment, however it does not feel like it at all.  The people who work at this apartment building—those at the reception etc.—are also very helpful and able persons.  They assisted us whenever we needed the help, which would have probably happened even if Karim did not also talk to them on our behalf upon our arrival.   

However, the biggest asset of this property is probably its location.  It is situated at the heart of downtown Montreal.  If your desire is to do all the touristy-stuff Montreal has to offer especially in the summer, this apartment is ideally situated.  For instance, the day after we arrived (July 1), the Canada Day Parade took place only a street away (5 mins walk).  A couple of days later, a cycling race happened right in front of the building, which was a lot of fun to watch.  Quartier des spectacles, where the Jazz Festival was happening, is only a couple of metro stops away.  The Old Port/Old Town is about a 10 min taxi/car ride.  

This location should also prove ideal for families from outside Montreal who wish to visit the numerous universities in Montreal.  Both Concordia* and McGill are at a walking distance, and UQAM is again only several metro/bus stops away.  This may also apply to scholars. (*Not Loyola Campus, but the downtown campus)

In all, we were very happy with our stay.  Great host, great apartment, great location, and a most wonderful city.

"I don't do negative reviews, but this is not a video, pic, opinion. This was technically a transaction between two parties (three?). I will stick to the facts and you can draw your own conclusions.
I booked my first trip using airbnb on Oct 15th (credit card record) . Since it was my first time I email with some questions but didn't hear back. I wasn't alarmed since it seemed to be a hosting business posting through this website.
On Nov 18th, three days before my trip I email a second time. The host never replied me. On Tuesday Nov 20th at noon my spouse was able to talk on the phone (we weren't sure about bringing linen, parking and/or how we would get the key). Everything looks fine, he will be waiting for us, be sure to text 30 mins before getting there.
Since we were planning on leaving at 5 am, I went to bed early. At 11:33 pm I got a text message that couldn't make sense ... checked my email and there was a message about a heating issue and that ..."" I unfortunately wont be able to get the heating system back in operation before your arrival.Please accept my apologies."" I wasn't sure how to proceed, would I get the apartment later in the afternoon? What does it mean? I went back to bed thinking I need to get up earlier; will check my email later and hoping for good news.
At 1:13 am. I got a second text saying my reservation has been cancelled. Now I was suddenly awake. In a couple of hours I need to wake my family up for a 7 hours drive to a metropolitan city where we don't have a place to sleep?! 
By now I have 3 emails from airbnb in my inbox ... at 1:13 am with the cancellation ... 1:28 am with a ticket number ... 1:37 am some manager following up ... 
One of the emails have a button to get a refund or a button to rebook. 
I booked a hotel using a well known travel website, once I got my confirmation I requested a refund (which shows now in my credit card with Nov 22nd).
So as far as my experience was, I won't be using or recommend airbnb. Maybe it was an isolated case, maybe the heating was really broken, I don't want to hurt anybody's business but something didn't add up. As a consumer I felt completely vulnerable. 
By the way: I don't know how much information airbnb shared with the hosts but to be able to book you need to upload your drive license and/or passport, a recent picture and I might be forgetting something ... I spent hours preparing this trip that almost didn't happen, but maybe because I knew the destination pretty well I was able to fix it quickly. 
What I'm not so sure of fixing quickly is removing my personal data from airbnb.","9"
"Suite à un problème avec l appartement que j avais loué, on nous a donné un autre appartement un peu plus petit mais plus luxueux. Équipements modernes, très propre, bien situé avec un garage; excellent pour un séjour  à Montréal.

Je n ai pas rencontré Kams, c est son ami Rubens , qui nous accueilli. Check in imposé á 18:30 que j ai pu négocier à 17:45 . C est un peu tard surtout que le Check out est a 12:00. Il ne semblait pas savoir grand chose sur notre arrivée. Communication avec Kams par mail lente au début mais très réactif par la suite, pour éclaircir certains points donc le changement d appartement. 

Excellent appartement, bien localisé, bon rapport qualité/ prix. À recommander sans hésiter.","9"
"Karim was an amazing host. Answered a last minute request, picked us up and even ordered an Uber for us to transport our tons of luggage. The unit wasn't exactly the one in the photos, but same amenities in the same building and was probably even better. I highly recommend anything he has to offer, and we'll certainly be back.","9"

"Nous voyagions en famille (3 personnes) et nous avions réservé ce grand logement avec jacuzzi pour profiter de la fin de notre périple au Canada.
Tout à commencer par un jeu de piste pour réussir à trouver le collaborateur de l'hôte, dans un quartier où on ne peux pas stationner avec pas loin de 10 coups de fil.
A ce moment, il prétend un problème électrique dans l'appartement, et nous réoriente vers un autre appartement et une place de stationnement dans la rue avec une carte de paiement pour l'achat des tickets.
Au final, cet appartement ne comportait qu'un lit double et pas de jacuzzi.
Il nous a proposer un matelas gonflable: unique pour un appartement luxueux!
Nous avons naturellement refusé et il nous a promis que nous ne serions remboursé.
Nous avons dû trouver une solution d'urgence pour trouver un hébergement à 19h car il n'avait pas pris la peine de nous prévenir de l'indisponibilité avant le check-in.
Après 3 jours, toujours aucun remboursement.
J'ai dû faire appel à AirBnb pour faire annuler la réservation et initier le remboursement.
Bref, hôte qui ne communique pas, qui ne gère pas grand chose.
Pas sérieux, à éviter absolument/","9"
"The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","9"
"Although this host was helping AirbnB and I out of a difficult situation by being available last minute, this unit was not what was pictured or described at all. It felt like we got a bait and switch unit. And, because apparently AirBnB’s are not allowed in the building, we were escorted they the back door/parking garage by hosts and asked to keep a low profile. The unit looked  like they had no longer cared. Area furniture, broken mirror in bedroom, all the pictures were crooked. It looked like a college student lived there. It was not at all what was advertised or pictured. It was terribly disappointing.","9"
"The host cancelled our stay the morning of our flight arrival in Montreal !!!We booked 2 months in advance the same apaprtment with the same host we did 8 months ago. We received the usual airbnb message of our incomimg trip 7 days prior to our stay. I send a message to the host two days before as I did not received any information on where and how to meet and get the key. I resent a message the 18 hours before and just before taking our flight to Montreal. No answer !

We landed in MOntreal and I received from AirBnb an email, a SMS and a phone message saying that the Host cancelled our stay.  We had to find an hotel and of course at peak tourist season and higher price.  This is not an individual who rent his appartment but some kind of company.  Very unprofessionnal and not trust worthy.","9"
"Karim was overall a good host, but I was disappointed that he did not respond to messages in the Airbnb interface. The place was great: pool + hot tub, location, cleanliness, all great!","9"
"The space was very nice and in a great location but I had some issues with communication. I was only contactable on WiFi and the WiFi connection stopped for 3 days.","9"
"To say it simple: what you see is what you get. :) Though we had shortly to switch to another apartment (due to a water damage) it met exactly our expectations. Karims apartments seem to be all of the same modern style. Nice lounge area, two TV's, a modern bathroom, a comfortable bed and a well-equipped kitchen. Above all a free parking-space in the garage and a heated pool outside. A really amazing extra was the free coffee-service in the lobby from Mon-Fri which we really enjoyed.
Our apartment was - as promised - in the heart of Downtown and also only a few steps away from ""Crescent Street"" with all its bars, pubs and restaurants.
Prior to our visit I was al litte concerned if the central location might cause too much noise but in the end we heard nothing. No noise from the streets or any neighbours.
The only little thing that was missing was a hair-dryer (or maybe we just didn't find it....?). However, due to the hot summer-temperatures it was not really an issue for us and I'm sure Karim will handle this. ;) He has a back-up for nearly everything and if something is not working or missing just let him know.
We would definitely stay in the apartment again!","9"
"Bien pour visiter Montreal 2j.","9"
"The apartment was great and the building was also very nice. Mid-way through my stay the internet was upgraded to 1 Gbps, which was super nice to have, though it was already plenty quick.","9"
"Very comfortable accommodations and the location was wonderful! If you want to visit Montreal and Old Montreal, this is the place to stay. The Museum of Fine Arts is a block away, the Metro is close by and the variety of restaurants is amazing!","9"
"This condo is really well located and comfortable for this single traveler. I appreciated having the space and amenities of a condo. The appointments are sparse- just a few minimal items in the kitchen, which are enough to get by. As others have mentioned, this host is not consistently accessible within the app, but was really responsive via phone. Unlike others, I had absolutely no trouble with the WiFi- that worked great ","9"
"Host cancelled day of trip. Found out after arriving in Montreal.","9"
"Great host, Karim went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable.  Even if it meant delivering a blowdryer and body wash at 11pm at night and picking us up in the freezing rain and arranging for parking for my car.   

I would recommend staying here, great location and easy access to downtown!","9"
"Nice location and stylish place with good view. Several amenities such as hot shower and sink are broken.","9"
"J'ai passé six semaines dans l'appartement de Marie-Helene et il était parfait ! Il est tres bien situé, a deux pas de l'avenue mont-royal, avec un supermarché a moins de 5 minutes a pied. L'arret Frontenac est a 15 minutes a pied, et l'arret Mont Royal a env. 20 minutes (plus vite si vous prenez le bus qui part de l'avenue Mont-Royal). L'appartement lui-meme était exactement comme dans les photos et était tres propre et bien équipé, il y avait tout ce qu'il fallait. Marie-Helene est disponible et tres réactive en cas de probleme ou de conseils. La prochaine fois que j'aurai besoin de m'héberger a Montréal, je n'hésiterai pas a contacter Marie-Helene :)

I spent six weeks in Marie-Helene's apartment and it was perfect! It was very well located, a short distance from Mont-Royal Avenue, with a supermarket less than 5 minutes walk away. Frontenac metro was 15 minutes away, and Mont-Royal metro was about 20 minutes away (faster if you took the bus that leaves from Mont-Royal avenue). The apartment itself was exactly as shown in the photos and was very clean and well-equipped, it had everything I needed. Marie-Helene was quick to respond to any problems or questions. The next time I need somewhere to stay in Montréal, I won't hesitate to contact Marie-Helene :)","10"
"Once again. Marie was excellent. She provided everything I needed and goes above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. This was my second time at her place and would not hesitate to stay again. Thank you Marie.","10"
"We had a great stay in Marie Helene's flat. The flat is well located close to Plateau Mont-Royal, with plenty of shops and many restaurants nearby, and a 2 minute walk to the bus stop(or 30 minute walk to the Metro station). The flat itself is well-equipped with everything you could need for an extended stay, and tastefully decorated. Marie Helene was very friendly and helpful, and provided us with useful books on the city. We would definitely stay here again next time we visit Montreal.","10"
"We had a very nice time at Marie-Hélène's appartement. The location is perfect as it is situated in the middle of the Plateau Mont-Royal and not more than 20min from the city centre and all the important sights of Montréal! The appartement is clean, modern and tastefully decorated. Fancy restaurants and shops are located just neraby the very frequented Avenue du Mont Royal. 
We totaly would go again!","10"
"I had a wonderful time staying here! The location is wonderful, its close to shops and transport and i found it a breeze getting places while living there. The apartment is lovely too, all modern and new with everything you need. Unfortunately i did not get to meet Marie-Hélène but she was only a text or call away if i needed anything and her brother who lives upstairs introduced himself and was there if anything was needed. 

Overall if this is your first visit to Montréal or you come here often, this place come highly recommended.","10"
"O apartamento é ótimo, muito bem localizado, todo renovado e equipado.
Fica a pouco mais de uma quadrada Av Mont-Royal, avenida central do Plateau. Tem supermercado e ônibus perto e boa conexão com o metrô.
O apartamento tem tudo. Cozinha equipada mesmo para quem gosta de cozinhar. 
Não tem secadora mas realmente não precisa, pois as roupas secam muito rápido no varal.
Não conheci Marie-Helene, apenas seu irmão. Sempre foram atenciosos e responderam ao que precisei. Me deixaram bastante à vontade durante todo o período.
Totalmente recomendo!!!","10"
"J'ai passé 4 mois chez Marie-Hélène. Tout c'est très bien passé l'appartement est conforme a la description, décoré avec goût et calme. Le quartier est très agréable avec beaucoup de boutiques et de magasins d'alimentation, le parc lafontaine,bon restaurants... En revanche l'appartement est a 20-25min a pied du métro mont-royal je recommande de prendre le bus 97 pour s'y rendre. Marie-Hélène et son frère (qui habite au dessus) se sont montrés très accueillants et obligeants. 
Je recommande fortement cet appartement et y retournerais avec plaisir!","10"
"Super endroit, très cosy, bien équipé et avec un charmant petit balcon arrière.
Bien situé dans le Plateau, beaucoup de commerces à proximité, beaucoup de bus pour se rendre au métro/centre-ville. 
Marie est très accueillante et réactive. Nous recommandons ce bnb à tout ce qui veulent découvrir Montreal et en même temps résider dans un endroit calme ! ","10"
"J'ai été tres bien acceuilli.
La description du logement est parfaitement exacte.","10"
"Super séjour merci beaucoup A Marie-Helene pour tout, super appartement!  A très vite :) ","10"
"We enjoyed a month at Marie's apartment. It was just as described, very clean and arranged with much attention on details and good taste. We found the necessary in the kitchen. 
The area is very nice and quiet but also close to a lot of things to do (park, pool, shopping, bars, restaurants and groceries stores).","10"
"We stayed there six weeks and found that the location of the apartment was perfect with a big varieties of coffee shops, restaurants and bars nearby. The Baldwin parc is great for picnics.
The apartment is the same as in the pictures and did not disappoint.","10"
"L'appartement de Marie-Hélène est très agréable, parfaitement situé sur le Plateau, spacieux et bien équipé. Les alentours du quartier sont calmes, mais à deux pas de l'appart on se trouve sur l'Avenue du Mont-Royal, une des rues les plus ""buzzing"" de la ville.
On peut facilement se sentir chez-soi dans l'appart et je vais certainement revenir ici pour mon prochain séjour à Montréal!","10"
"Nous sommes restés 6 mois à l'appartement, quartier très calme et familial, à 3 minutes à pieds du supermarché et de l'arrêt de bus, station de métro facilement accessible à pieds si vous aimez marcher un peu (15/20 minutes, ou 5 minutes en bus). Pour les sportifs, le gym du plateau est à moins de 10 minutes à pieds ;)","10"
"I thoroughly enjoyed my month staying at the apartment.  It was so quiet, cozy, and secure.  I was surprised to find a nearly new front load washer.  It made it very convenient as I didn't travel with a lot of extra clothes.  The apartment is well located close to many stores and restaurants.  The apartment is supplied with lots of dishes and utensils to cook your own meals.  There's plenty of room to have guests stay on the pull out couch. Several bus lines easily connect to Metro in a matter of minutes. I'd recommend that if you don't have a car, pay for a one month Opus card.  I'd stay in the apartment again!  Many thanks!","10"
"Logement très fonctionnel, propre, et idéalement situé.

Perfect appartment, clean and very well situated.
Highly recommended","10"
"Logement calme et bien équipé à proximité des commerces, restaurants et transports en commun. Excellent accueil.","10"
"Logement impeccable et bien situé.  Quartier tranquille et sympathique.  Belle expérience de vie Montréalaise","10"
"The apartment was very nice and well equipped - ideal for a longer stay. Also the neighborhood on the plateau is great - nice and friendly people and lots of nice shops, boutiques and cafes/restaurant at Avenue du Mont-Royal. 
We also appreciated the many parks arounds, the bixi stations and the comfortable connections nearby with STM.","10"
"Appartement dans un quartier calme,proche des commerces et des transports.","10"
"Merci Xavier ! Je suis arrivé très tard la nuit après un contrat et l'endroit était exactement comme Xavier me l'avait communiqué. Quartier très tranquille mais pas loin du centre actif de la ville. J'ai aimé les grands arbres de la rue, plein d'oiseaux, la piste cyclable. Le lendemain matin j'ai vraiment apprécié le secteur, le choix était là pour les cafés et j'ai finalement pris le temps d'aller découvrir le coloré Marché Jean-Talon à quelques coins de rues de l'appartement de Xavier. Merci encore et au plaisir, c'est tellement génial Airbnb quand on réalise que c'est si simple être hébergé chez des gens accueillants plutôt qu'au centre-ville bruyant :-)","10"
"Un super séjour. Des hôtes accueillant, sympathique et disponible. La chambre est grande et il y a une belle arrière cour pour profiter du soleil. Le quartier est agréable et calme à proximité des commerces, tout y est pour passé un bon séjour ! ","10"
"Xavier's place was amazing... 5 Stars!!!

Both he and Robert were amazing hosts, very friendly and a lot of fun to talk too.

The house is beautiful and in a great location. It was so convienent, with many great coffee shops and restaurants all walking distance. The train station is also close by too, so very easy to get around the city.

I will definitely be coming back to stay there again when I return to Montreal :) 

Their home has been one of my favorite places I've stayed at so far!

I would highly recommend Xavier's place to all travelers.","10"
"I spent close to a month in this beautiful apartment, where I enjoyed all of its bright and quiet spaces. The neighborhood is tree-lined and largely residential, but bordered by main streets that are full of hang out spots and whatever food wants or needs one might have. The apartment is within walking distance from many nice parts and parks of Montreal, and accessible by public transportation if one wants to go a bit further. 

Xavier and Robert were really lovely and hospitable, and it was a pleasure to share the apartment with them and their beautiful dog Juliette.","10"
"Xavier's place is on a quiet side street but close to many interesting sights: Little Italy, the Jean Talon market, lots of small restaurants and cafes, easy access to the orange metro line. 
The room is bright and spacious, and decorated in retro style with many little touches (as is the rest of the apartment). Really nice semi-closed patio on the back. Excellent value overall! If you like dogs, even better, Juliette is an angel and will let you rub her belly.
Xavier was a great host, he welcomed me warmly and was very helpful in giving me advice on settling down in Montreal. He was respectful and discreet, but didn't hesitate to share a beer and a chat with me. Highly recommended!","10"
"J'ai d'abord été accueilli par la maitresse des lieux, la belle et paisible Juliette, ensuite j'ai pu rencontrer Xavier et Robert qui m'ont tout deux permis de passer d'excellents moments en leur compagnie.
La maison est très spacieuse avec une cours à l’arrière parfaite pour ""chiller"" et travailler au soleil.
Merci pour ces 10 jours
Cordialement","10"
"Spacious place to stay and work, I especially enjoyed the patio and backyard - there are so many tables ;) Xavier and Robert are both very friendly and helpful. They are open to share the space and willing to give local tips. La Petite Patrie is a safe, quiet, and convenient neighborhood with access to buses and metro, groceries, cafes and restos. I hope to stay at Xavier’s the next time I’m in the city.","10"
"Appartement très bien situé. Chambre spacieuse et confortable.","10"
"J’ai passé un très agréable séjour de 2,5 semaines chez Xavier. L’appartement est propre, lumineux, plein de charme, typique de Montréal, très calme et entouré d'arbres. La chambre est très spacieuse et bien décorée, paisible et le lit confortable. Une grande véranda donne sur le jardin. L’appartement est situé près du métro Beaubien, de la rue St Hubert et du marché Jean Talon, à proximité de nombreux commerces et restaurants. 
Xavier et Robert sont des hôtes accueillants,chaleureux et respectueux avec qui j'ai eu des discussions très intéressantes. J’y retournerai avec joie et recommanderai sans réserve ce logement à mes amis.","10"
"Fiquei no espaço do Xavier e do Robert por 1 mês.
Eles foram muito simpáticos e hospitaleiros desde o início. A casa é muito grande e conta com um ótimo jardim. É localizado em um bairro muito simpático com fácil acesso ao metro, ônibus, mercearias, cafés, parques, cinemas...
O quarto é muito grande, bem iluminado e confortável.

Obrigado pela acolhida, Robert e Xavier. Até a próxima","10"
"Xavier is a thoughtful and friendly host. The room and shared spaces are clean and the home is in a great part of town. I felt comfortable and welcome during my entire stay. Don't hesitate to stay with Xavier :-)","10"
"Chez Xavier était sympa et tranquille. J’aimais le quartier, proche du supermarché, la station du métro et le marché Jean Talon.","10"
"I had a short but excellent stay at Xavier’s place. It’s unique decor is good for relaxing. And it’s in a very nice and peaceful area.
It was great interacting with Xavier who is full of creative talents. And Juliette was affable as well.","10"
"Très belle place et propre , Adam à été très accueillant j'ai bien aimer ma fin de semaine","10"
"I stayed for six weeks while I did an apartment search.  I was very value-conscious when making the booking, and the value was just excellent.  Adam was very eager to please.  The location is wonderful: a quick walk to blue and orange subway (Metro) lines, and right by two very useful bus routes, the 51 and the 165.  Also, many stores, restaurants, cafes, etc. in both directions from building.  If value is important, you could hardly do better.","10"
"The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.","10"
"Really clean all around, nice little kitchen. Will definitely be my first option next time I visit. No complains. Two thumbs up ","10"
"The apartment is exactly as you can see in the pictures and has everything you need in kitchen appliances and linen matters. The flat could use some repairs (like the floor and the sofa) but it's comfortable and has everything you need to stay for a while (except for a broom or a mop that I'll add). 
But everything was good and Adam was always reachable, helpful and nice :)","10"
"Adam was very communicative and the place had everything you would need for a comfortable stay!","10"
"Great place to stay. Adam was an amazing host. The place was very spacious and clean. Close to stores restaurants and downtown Montreal","10"
"The appartement is extremely clean. The location is great, near metro and bus station. 5 mns to supermarket and pharmacy. Adam is very helpful host. We enjoyed our stay and would high recommend it to our friends.","10"
"Adam was a gracious host. Great place to stay. Very clean.","10"
"I had a comfortable stay at Adam's apartment.  It was very clean, and conveniently located near Côte-des-Neiges and the Université de Montréal. 
 Adam was very friendly, and flexible with the check-in/out.","10"
"Tres sympa, bien situe, propre, equipe, excellent sejour chez Adam. On y retournera, en tout cas on recommande.","10"
"We had a great time at Adams, we love the location, check in and check out was easy, place was clean and confortable, communication was good too.","10"
"Appartement plus ou moins conforme. Emplacement super.","10"
"Good place to stay would recommend","10"
"Adam's apartment shows true to photos. The kitchen is small but well stocked for cooking  and the bed is comfortable. The air conditioning is a window unit but it cools down most of the apartment well. There is a working elevator just across the hall from Adam's apartment. It is within walking distance to l'Oratoire and grocery/restaurants. Would definitely recommend as the value is great for the price and Adam was a very accommodating host.","10"
"The place is as advertised.  Great place to stay at. Adam is an excellent host. Never had any issue. Would recommend to stay","10"
"Adam was a wonderful host. He met me at the apartment for check-in and explained the building and where everything was located. I had to contact him during my stay with a few questions about the area and he responded within minutes. 

The apartment was as advertised and also had a new sectional which was a nice touch. There was plenty of street parking and the apartment was located in a nice quiet area, that was a close walking distance to stores and restaurants. ","10"
"Adam was very quick to respond when we needed a place to stay last minute. He met us within a few hours to show us the apartment and give us the keys. The apartment was exactly as described. It was very close to a bus stop (right outside the front door) and about a 10 minute walk to the Snowdon metro station.","10"
"Adam's place is even better than what you see when you book.  He has all the necessary things you require for your trip and even more, like pasta, olive oil, varieties of tea, sugar, ear buds and even hand soap and body soap.  

The place is very clean,  the washroom is sparkling clean, the linen is washed and smells fresh, the living room is very comfortable to watch TV and just have a relaxing evening.
The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal or just put stuff in the oven, the fridge worked very well.  The A/c was a blessing as it gets quite warm in summer.

Adam is very quick at communication and always answered the phone when I called him or messaged him.  He gave us a very good restaurant recommendation for our anniversary dinner 'Rayan'  which specialises in seafood, has very fresh stuff and is decently priced.

Our check in and checkout was seamless and we had absolutely no problem finding the nearest supermarket, tourist sites, easily accessible public transport, close to old Montreal and downtown.  Very close to St. Joseph's oratory.  Safe neighbourhood at all times of the day.  

Adam is an extremely good host, I would recommend his place anytime to anyone without hesitation.  

Thank you Adam for letting us reserve your place.  We hope to book it again when we next visit Montreal.  
Kind regards, 
","10"

"Adam a été un super hôte, il a tout fait pour que mes parents s'y sentent bien. Ils ont séjourné 3 semaines dans son appartement très conforme à l'annonce. L'emplacement est idéal par le bus et métro à quelques mètres. Je recommande sans hésitation super qualité prix. Merci Adam.","10"

"Eric's apartment was a fantastic choice for our stay in Montreal. What a great location! The neighbourhood is close to the excitement of the theatre district, restaurants, bars, and museums, but quiet enough to relax at home away from the bustle of the busy downtown. The apartment itself is in excellent care. We had everything we needed for our stay. All the appliances are new and in good repair, and the furnishings are comfortable and stylish. 

Eric is a great host. He was there to greet us and make sure we got settled in okay. He even checked-in part way through our stay to ask how we were doing, which was very thoughtful. Eric also left us great information about the attractions and amenities around the neighbourhood—another thoughtful, personal touch!

If you're looking to stay in a great part of Montreal and have a fantastic host, I happily recommend Eric and his apartment. We already miss ""our Montreal apartment.""","9"
"Eric's apartment was bright, clean and beautiful. The location was even better, right downtown within walking distance to everything we needed. Highly recommended, Eric is very friendly and was accommodating to our arrival/departure schedule.

"Un accueil chaleureux et décontracté. Des renseignement précieux sur les commerces et les restaurants à proximité pour pouvoir profiter de Montréal dès le premier jour sur des chapeaux de roue !!!
L'appartement est neuf et très bien placé entre deux stations de métro et à moins de 100 m d'un arrêt de l'autobus 747 qui relie l'aéroport à la ville.
Tout est donc parfait !!!","9"
"Eric's 1-bd/1-ba condo was in excellent condition - brand new with all the appliances, supplies, and furniture you'd need.  The location was great, with easy access to the metro and bus lines.

Eric was very easy to communicate with.  He was also very responsive to my questions, and left a binder with very helpful information about the neighborhood and nearby restaurants, shops, even ATMs and delivery menus.  He was also very flexible with check-in & check-out times, which we really appreciated.

We had a fantastic stay at Eric's condo in Montreal.  I would definitely recommend his place, and would gladly stay there again when we return to Montreal.  

Thanks for everything, Eric!  It was such a pleasure to meet you.

","9"
"Eric was super nice and friendly. He was extremely helpful and flexible with check in and check out time. The apartment is on a great location, clean and beautiful. Eric left a binder with lots of tips and information about the city. I will easily go back to his place :) ","9"
"My friend and I had a very enjoyable stay at Eric's condo.  The accommodations were very clean and everything was provided that we needed to enhance our visit to Montreal.  Long term parking was easy in a nearby garage, so I could park and then explore the city.  My friend took the #747 bus from the airport which dropped her off right on Eric's corner.  I slept in the very comfortable bed.  My friend choose the couch which folded down into a bed, rather than those pull out couch mattresses which can be uncomfortable. The neighborhood seemed in transition, but we felt safe and had no difficulties.  The location was convenient to Old Montreal, downtown, the entertainment district and museum area either walking or by the metro.  All and all an excellent choice.

","9"
"Erick's apartment is the perfect place from which to explore the city of Montreal. It has a Walkscore of 99, a Transit score of 100 and a rider's score of 100, all from (Website hidden by Airbnb) What a location!

You can walk to the old port, the Place des Arts for the festivals, Rue St Denis for 100s of restaurants and bars etc.  

The main Metro interchange station, Berri UQAM is a few blocks away, which is key to move around town, check it out on the Montreal Metro map to see what I mean.
 
If biking is your thing there is a Bixi (Montreal's public bike rental scheme)  stand one block away, 5 dollars for 24 hours.

The building is part of a block that is being gentrified with new, modern apartment buildings. The police station was literally our next door neighbor and the apartment is facing the police station parking lot, so it must be one of the safest places in the downtown core. 

Everything inside the apartment was in as new condition, the kitchen was very well equipped and Erick was kind enough to leave a full supply basic items such as  dishwasher and laundry detergent , toilet paper, etc... so we didn't need to buy anything other than food in the first few days. 

I was there with my wife and 2 young daughters and the apartment was functional and airy enough that we didn't feel crowded. The sofa bed was perfect for our 2 daughters to sleep in.

You really can´t go wrong with renting this apartment, it's a no brainer if you find it available.

"This is a great one-bedroom with open floor plan for the common areas.  Host was very communicative and got back to me almost immediately when I contacted him.  The apartment is street level, so I did not have to lug my bags up a flight of stairs.  There was also a privacy finish on the windows and draperies, so that I didn't feel like I was on display to passersby (which there were not many because it is a residential street).  Around the corner on the commercial street are many cool shops and eating spots.  A couple of blocks to some fab restaurants and stores on St. Laurent in one direction and a few more blocks the other way on St. Denis.  The Metro was within walking distance and made getting to and from the airport really easy (and inexpensive).  Many thanks, Alexandre!","9"
"Very nice, cheerful place. Well located a few blocks from the metro and around the corner from many restaurants and stores.","9"
"The place is so convenient to shops, restaurants and bars. Really trendy area. Lots to explore. 
Kate and Alex are amazing hosts. Very responsive and friendly. 
We will likely come back for another stay since we haven’t got a chance to explore the entire area. Nice change from downtown","9"
"Alexandre and Kate were great hosts. This is my second time using Air BnB, and another great experience. He met us at the place (we arrived a touch late) and explained the best place for legal parking. The Apartment was very cozy and immaculately clean. Since it was a 1st floor (Website hidden by Airbnb) made it easy for unloading. There unit almost was too warm, which is great considering the temp in Montreal! He even texted my girl to see how our trip was going. Great guy.  Our trip was amazing and I think it started with meeting Alexandre and staying in the Plateau.  A great experience!","9"
"Zoë's place is absolutely gorgeous! Emaculately clean, light, and airy with trendy decor. The kitchen was perfect for preparing meals and the back porch provided a peaceful spot to snuggle up with tea and a good book. It is in a safe, gorgeous neighborhood with easy access to a bunch of shops, restaurants and the metro. This was my first stay in Montreal and it was the perfect home base for exploring such an awesome city. Zoë was the most gracious host! She suggested a bunch of must see/must do things and was even sweet enough to leave a hand-drawn map to guide me on my adventures. I will definitely be returning ASAP! ","10"
"Zoe is a very sweet host. Prepared all items we need. Even more, prepared some fashion items which we never experienced in other landlord we lived in AirBnB condo, even in Paris condo. It's a great living experience in last 2 days. And the condo location is very convenient. Will definitely recommend for others who want to have a awesome family trip. Thanks, Zoe! Fairmount Bagel taste is good! :)","10"
"Zoe's apartment was immaculate and the photos represented it accurately. I really appreciated this because I'd just come from another AirBnb which was messy & super-lived in! Getting the keys was easy, and the neighborhood was okay. It's a safe, pretty, residential neighborhood, not at all touristy, which was great --  but there aren't a ton of restaurants & services right near by, so some might prefer to stay in a neighborhood with more cafes, etc. But the spaciousness & cleanliness of Zoe's very cute apartment were great. 

A couple of things to note: There is a long flight of stairs to the apartment (you enter the front door & then come to the flight of stairs once inside). This would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues, anyone dealing with a young child -- stroller, etc. -- or an elderly person with a cane or walker. 

And although the kitchen had brand-new stove, electric kettle, French press coffee pot, good selection of knives, it would have been wonderful to have a microwave. When you're in a city for only a night or two or three, it's really nice to be able to heat up take-out quickly, without having to bother with the oven!

The TV had Netflix on it & I watched  a movie one night, which was great, and the shower was wonderful!

But all in all, a great place to stay. ","10"
"Zoe's place was just as amazing as everyone else says!  Comfy beds, beautiful views and a great pizza place right around (pendeli's pizza).  Book it today!","10"
"Zoe's apartment is adorable, thoughtfully furnished with a modern design. It was clean, and quite big, bigger than we expected--and with a dishwasher, washer/dryer in the basement, etc. It is walking distance to the French restaurants of Outremont, with their terrace seating, and lovely parks/a yummy ice cream parlor/several cafes (we loved Cafe Prague). A little longer walk (but definitely walkable, and we did it with a five-year-old in tow) is Mile End, with a hipster vibe, even more restaurants/bars/and the awesome Drawn and Quarterly bookshop.

Zoe was responsive and kind. Definitely recommended. ","10"
"Zoe's place is beautiful.  I would love it if she could decorate our home flat! neighborhood is great, especially with kids: you are two short blocks from the pool and splash zone at Kennedy park.  you are a bit far to walk from the main resto and bar areas, but there is bixi at outrement metro next door so everything is an easy ride (esp. mile end).  would stay again.","10"
"All perfect! As described. Very recommendable.","10"
"Zoe was a fantastic host. She was extremely responsive and communicative, as well as very accommodating to our arrival and departure times. We had a fantastic stay at her place.

The neighborhood is safe and beautiful with easy transportation anywhere in the city. Metro Outremont is 5min away, and this apartment is off the main street, but 2mins away from major bus stops. It's also walking/biking distance to Bernard Street, and to the Mile End, where there are many restaurants, bars and coffee shops.

For future users, Zoe has recently renovated the dining and kitchen space, and it's so much more modern, open, and beautiful than the old photos still up. Our 2.5yr old son loved playing in this newly renovated space. 

We would definitely come back! We hope you love this apartment as much as we did!
","10"
"Zoe was on point in terms of preparing in advance for my arrival, and it was so easy to figure out the logistics of entering the apartment. The apartment was very clean and beautifully styled. The neighbourhood is quiet, cute, and easily accessible - very close to a subway station.","10"
"The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful - lots of trees and very scenic overall, but still had a little pocket of good restaurants! The ride to downtown Montreal was not very far, so the location overall was convenient. 

Zoe was extremely communicative throughout the process, from pre-arrival to  during our stay. Her apartment is absolutely beautiful and SO spacious. The light is also gorgeous. ","10"
"Appartement spacieux clair et vraiment bien placé (proche métro, bus...) dans quartier très agréable.
l'appartement est également très bien agencé et décoré.
Zoé est une hôte très disponible répondant à nos questions très rapidement et chaleureusement.
Ne pas hésiter si vous voulez séjourner dans cette belle ville de Montréal.
","10"
"Zoe's apartment was fantastic for my husband and two little girls.  We very much enjoyed having a place that was so comfortable, spacious, and well designed away from home.  The kitchen and bathroom have been renovated since the pictures in the profile were taken and both were done very well.  Zoe's apartment is in a great location, near Bernard St., Miles End, and a short ride downtown.  When we come back to Montreal, we would definitely stay here again.","10"
"Zoe's place is stunning, much bigger than we expected and very comfortable with a new bathroom (great shower!) and a balcony as well. Outremont is a great little neighbourhood, the apartment is close to the metro, lots of good restaurants and bakeries nearby. I joked I should probably move to Montreal and rent from her permanently! Zoe was very helpful before our arrival, and is easy to get a hold of. I would certainly stay here again. ","10"
"C est notre second séjour chez Zoé.
Comme la première fois, tout à été très bien ! L appartement est magnifique et très bien situé. Zoé est une hôte chaleureuse et disponible. 
N hésitez surtout pas, si vous venez à Montréal.
","10"
"Appartement adorable, très agréable à vivre, dans un quartier paisible mais néanmoins pourvu de tous les commerces nécessaires. Le stationnement y est très aisé.
Zoé est une personne charmante, arrangeante, disponible, avec en outre  beaucoup de goût. Encore merci.

"非常棒!犹太区,安全,安静,方便,远离旅游区的杂乱;房间非常大,干净整洁;布置精致有品味;床舒适｡值!","10"
"LeCube was amazing! It was, in fact, a cube. But for anyone who doesn't need a kitchen - this is perfect. I rented a room with a balcony and it was fantastic. The room was beautifully set up, immaculate, the bed was comfy and best of all - the shower was really, really nice. haha. I will definitely rent from them again, when I am back in town. ","10"
"Where to even begin. Staying at leqube was by far one of the best and most memorable experiences we've had using Airbnb and through traveling in general.

The first thing that captivated us and the reason we chose to stay here was their design, style, and layout of the property. Sophisticated yet minimal, clean, simple, modern,cool and easy. 

The people behind leqube really went out their way to think of what a guest could need during their stay, everything was excellent and better than described in the listing.

The whole check in and check out experience was fast, seamless and simple and didn't require any intersection with the host, however they are available to help at a moments notice if you might need. The room comes with everything listed, and yes the Apple TV and Netflix combo are a cool and modern feature to have. Almost forgot to mention they have a rooftop lounge with ping pong and hot tub.

Apart from the overall amazing trip we had in Montreal, one of the reasons that made it so magical and made this particular city so memorable in our minds was having a place like leqube to call our home away from home for the weekend.

Counting down the days to our next trip to Montreal and our next stay at leqube.","10"
"Un endroit exceptionnel ! Une adresse à retenir pour l'emplacement, le calme et la terrasse urbaine.. Impeccable ","10"
"The Cube is a great experience. Walking distance to everything and very cozy and quiet. A nice modern space. Check in and out is simple and the support staff were instantly responsive.","10"
"leQube is a really nice hotel apartment.","10"
"We had a wonderful stay here! The neighborhood felt safe, and there were many things to do that were walking distance from the apartment, which was very convenient. The space was functional and provided all the essentials.","10"
"We loved our stay at leQube.  The staff were friendly, super helpful and communicative.  The room was clean, fresh and comfortable.  We loved the Nespresso machine in the lobby, as well as the tea.  There is a fridge in the lobby where you can leave food if you label it.  The location is within walking distance of many restaurants and shops but a bit of a walk to the Metro if you want to head elsewhere.  That said the streets were so beautiful in the surrounding area we enjoyed the walk and ended up finding new restaurants and shops to explore along the way.  We would definitely come back!  ","10"
"Cozy and safe environment, easy access. Will definitely stay again.","10"
"LeQube offers a quaint, clean, central accommodation option. Great communication was the icing on the cake. Merci!","10"
"LeQube was the perfect place for our weekend getaway in Montreal. Super easy self check-in, well appointed rooms, and free snacks in the morning. Would stay again!","10"
"Everything was amazing. The place is so beautiful and clean ! I love the decoration, and the jacuzzi on the rooftop is pretty cool ! I could definitely live there all the time.
And, really good location","10"
"Cozy, clean and oh so convenient to the plateau buzz.","10"
"Belle chambre, et terrasse TOP !
Très bon emplacement (restaurants et bars à proximité)","10"
"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and loved it.  Great location near plenty of great restaurants, stores, and parks - but very quiet at night.  Gave us an opportunity to experience a side of Montreal we likely would not have experienced had we stayed at a hotel downtown.","10"
"My friends and I booked three units at LeQube and were all blown away! The place is amazingly decorated, in a great location close to restaurants, shops, bars, etc. The rooms were clean and modern and very well done and the self check-in/check-out was a breeze.  Beyond that, the little things really put this place over the top, from magazines, books, fresh fruit, coffee, and (Website hidden by Airbnb) yoga mats, which the girls used to do yoga on the rooftop each morning. We will definitely seek out more LeQube locations for our future travels. Trust me, book this place!","10"
"Très bon séjour à Montréal! Bon emplacement quartier tranquille proche de toutes commodités ( 2 stations de métro proches , restaurants et bars ...). Déco très tendance et hôtes réactifs.  Je recommande fortement !","10"
"LeQube is a fantastic option for light travelers! Great location - right along a residential street and steps from Duluth Ave and all its boutiques and brasseries. Easy walk to St Laurent and St Denis streets. Modest sized rooms, but very well maintained - Cozy and clean space. If the parking spot is available (slightly extra cost) I highly recommend - street parking can be a little tricky on St Hubert with the restrictions...and if your French is a little shakey :) Overall a great value and option in a great city!","10"
"LeQuebe is very stylish, clean and is located in a prime location in Montreal. Although there was not a lot of staff present, the access code entry and checkup emails made me feel safe and cared for. I would highly recommend it for someone who is looking for hotel quality without the high cost!","10"
"Great room!!","10"
"We loved our stay in this stylish space. Walking distance to lots of great restaurants and bars.","10"
"LeQube is in an excellent location and easily accessible.  Our room was clean, communication with the host was clear and the storage area for luggage before and after checkout was secure.  The lobby area is very convenient and stylish--it offers tea and coffee too.  We would absolutely stay again  and highly recommend LeQube to future guests.","10"
"I stayed at LeQube with a friend Jan 12-14. The communication from the host prior to the stay was excellent! I had no issues with the self-check-in. I loved the Welcome Booklet that was provided upon booking and came in handy the first day when choosing a restaurant to eat at.
LeQube is located in a lovely neighborhood, I always felt safe leaving the apartment.
The room decor was charming. I enjoyed the shower.
I was initially surprised by the size of the apartment. It was slightly smaller than I expected. However, I understand that this is common in Montreal and the overall value for the money is amazing.","10"
"LeQube, was one of my favorite Airbnb’s yet. The room was spotless, chic, and had a ton of space available to keep our luggage out of sight while we were there. This place also has a rooftop hot tub with a view of the city. 
If you’re trying to get out the door quickly, they even offer some hot coffee/tea, croissants and juice, such a nice touch. Most places were in walking distance. And at the very most you’re going to have a 15 minute walk to the main part of the city. Response time was incredibly quick. Although parking isn’t offered for every guest, it’s easy to find in the area, and we never parked more than a 1-2 minute walk from LeQube. We will definitely be staying here the next time we are in Montreal.","10"
"LeQube is a great option for a couple or single traveler. The apartment had everything that you would need for a quick stay in Montreal. Check in was seamless and communication was prompt.","10"
"bon voyage !","10"
"Another great stay at LeQube. I highly recommend it.","10"
"Love the space. Close to St. Denis with lots of access to restaurants and bars. Only downside is to find a parking spot close by.","10"
"The place was great in a nice neighbourhood. Will be staying here again on the future.","10"
"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay. It is quite small but perfect for a romantic getaway. Location is great and the whole decor was beautiful.","10"
"It’s a very cozy and stylish place. It was perfect for us thank you!!","10"
"Beautiful and stylish space in a central location :) Would definitely recommend!","10"
"Such a cute and stylish space. Somewhat small but it was adaquate and relaxing to stay in! The host welcomed us nicely and the process was quick and easy. We'd love to come back again!","10"
"I can’t speak highly enough about how good of a business LeQube runs. Was not disappointed and will definitely be coming back!","10"
"I had an awesome stay at LeQube.  Checking in and checking out was incredibly easy - they even provide luggage storage to accommodate any early arrivals and/or late departures.  The hosts are incredibly responsive!  The room and bathroom were both clean and comfortable.  During our stay, the hot tub was undergoing repairs.  So I was slightly disappointed I could not make use of this facility during this trip.  That being said, I still had a great time and if I'm ever back in Montreal, I'd definitely come back to stay at LeQube!","10"
"Very clean, and modern. Very small but perfect for two people!","10"
"Great location, and very clean space.","10"
"Wonderful place in a perfect location. The rooms are beautiful and stylish. The common space is lovely. We especially loved the rooftop dipping pool. The communication was excellent. I would highly recommend staying here!","10"
"Great place and plenty of restauarants in walking distance! The lighting in the apartment at night was the only down fall. Other then that the place was perfect for what we needed!","10"
"Great place. Very tiny but great.","10"
"Our original booking had an issue and the host Fred provided us an alternative location that was larger than our original stay and no extra cost! He was great enough to give us a call ahead of time to advise on the different location that was approx. 2-3 minutes away from the original stay. The location that was stayed at was immaculate! Gorgeous and super comforting. Absolutely amazing stay!! This stay was a romantic birthday getaway. I am looking forward to booking again!!!","10"
"Well situated building, lovely area, close to everything. Cosy rooms, I had everything I needed for a short-term stay. I was looking for a furnished apartment and I was so happy to find this offer. I would definitely come back again. Thank you.","10"
"This was my second time I stayed at one of Franca's Apt. I stayed for one month and everything was fine. The location is great and just near to restaurants, coffeeshops, bars. The subway station is just 5 minutes walking from building. Franca is a kind lady and whenever I had some problems, she answered my calls very quickly. ","10"
"The place is very clean and in a great location, the 24 bus will take you straight to downtown Montreal.

The wifi was unreliable but the issue seemed to be resolved with a new router towards the end of my stay.

Franca was a very accommodating host.","10"
"Appartement propre, bien situé, confortable et suffisamment équipé. Prévoyez cependant des adaptateurs Européens si vous venez de l'Europe. Franca à été une super hôte à l'écoute, réactive et aimable. Mon séjour à été très agréable. Je recommande !","10"
"Jiji and Alex's place is spacious and really well-situated in the heart of Mile End, with super easy access to transit, downtown and shops and restaurants around. Although Jiji was away upon our arrival, she arranged for an easy check-in. She was kind enough to provide us with all we needed for breakfast. We had a short but comfortable stay chez Jiji et Alex during the weekend.","10"
"This place was perfect for my weekend visit to Montreal! It hit all the items on my checklist - location, cleanliness, comfort, affordability. The apt. is warm & inviting, beds comfortable, all amenities were provided. It is within walking distance of nearly everything one would want to do - plenty of restaurants, nightlife, parks, shops. And although Jiji & Alex were out of town, they arranged for someone to meet my friend and me as soon as we arrived and get us settled in. There were even bagels & schmear waiting on the counter- so thoughtful! They left the numbers of local contacts should we need immediate assistance and Jiji kept in touch via email throughout the visit. She responded quickly and with detail - giving suggestions on what we should do in the area based on our list of interests. Jiji and Alex truly have a gift for hospitality - I highly recommend staying here should you venture to Montreal!","10"
"Although Jiji and Alex were away during our stay, they provided a seamless and gracious backup plan for our arrival. His mom and sister were super helpful in orienting us to the place. We loved the location in vibrant and interesting Mile End and were delighted with the kitchen arrangement and comfy bedrooms. A grocery store right downstairs made it especially convenient. This was a great size for two couples, with reliable internet, a great espresso machine, and  everything we needed for a weekend stay.","10"
"Jihane and Alexandre were great hosts, they provided us with all the information we required to get around the city. The location was great, close to the bus stop and metro station. The appartment was comfortable , clean and cozy! Thanks again for everything, Christine","10"
"Nous avons été très bien reçus chez Jihane et Alexandre. Il faut souligner leur attention et leurs précieux conseils. Nous sommes venus avec deux enfants et cela s'est très bien passé. L'appartement est très bien situé  tant en terme de transport que d commerces et activités. Un grand merci!","10"
"Wonderful place in a perfect location!","10"
"Accueil chaleureux et super logement. Proche des commerces et de nombreux restaurants, l'endroit reste calme. Je le recommande ! Merci encore :) ","10"
"Great place in an awesome neighbourhood. I couldn't have wished for a nicer place to stay, it is close to a lot of nice shops and restaurants and is nicely decorated and clean. If you want to experience Montreal I absolutely recommend staying here!","10"
"The apartment was close to restaurants and some shopping.  It was a bit of a distance to downtown and the metro.   Communication with our host was great.  They were very accommodating for our uncertain arrival time.  The apartment was spacious and very comfortable.","10"
"We couldn't have asked for a better stay on our long weekend in this great city!  Jiji and Alex's place is exactly as described, and the perfect location in the heart of the Mile End.  Restaurants and shops out the door, not to mention the grocery store underneath. Communication was great and they were readily available if anything was needed.  The space was perfect size for 2 couples, clean and well stocked with any essentials needed.  Great find in a good area!","10"
"Having stayed in many airbnbs in the last two years, Jihane was the most responsive, easy to contact, and friendliest host I've interacted with. The apartment is close to so many amenities. A couple things to be aware of for the summer, there is a lot of noise from the street with the windows open and the bedrooms get a lot of light. If you're sensitive to those things, bring earplugs and a sleep mask. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need.","10"
"Jihane made this experience-- she was a great communicator, friendly, and accommodating. I felt so welcome at her place!","10"
"Everything was as advertised. Great place and fantastic location.","10"
"Benjamin was very hospitable. He met my girlfriend and I when we arrived, and he was easy to communicate with while finding parking. He provided great suggestions for things to do and see in the city. This place is very cozy, centrally located, and the perfect spot for a great stay in Montreal! Thanks!","10"
"Benjamin was a lovely host. This was my first time instant booking and I have to admit I was a little nervous initially because I didn't get a reply until the third day after initial message. But it turns out it was a minor miscommunication, and communication onwards was pretty good. The fiancé and I had stayed 3 days/ 2 nights & enjoyed ourselves. The apartment was easily commutable from the airport, conveniently located for shopping and food, modern and well stocked with supplies. We had arrived earlier then our check in time and Benjamin met up with us to take our bags until it was time to check in, very nice gesture and saved us from lugging our bags in the snow! Would definitely stay here again. Thanks again Benjamin!!!","10"
"Ben was great. Was patient even when I was late and quick to respond to any text messages.

The unit was awesome. Very clean and spacious and little amenities (like coffee) were at my disposal as well.","10"
"Nosso anfitrião Benjamin foi perfeito , cumprindo tudo o que havíamos acordado , dos horários de check-in e check-out às detalhadas explicações sobre o apartamento.","10"
"Great experience over all! Benjamin was super nice and helpful with everything.  He made great suggestions on places to check out in the area which was nice. The place was super cozy and awesome, the listening is very accurate and I would recommend anyone looking to check out downtown Montreal to stay here!","10"
"We use Airbnb often, but our stay at Benjamin's apartment is one of our best experiences. The unit is clean, beautiful and well equipped. The bed is very comfortable. The shower is fantastic. It is in a very nice building in a convenient part of downtown Montreal. Benjamin is the perfect host, very accommodating. ","10"
"This is a perfect location, right near the Bell Centre! Ben was waiting for us upon arrival and showed us to the unit. The unit had everything we needed and our stay couldn't have been better. Thanks for everything!","10"
"I stayed at this lovely studio with my best friend for 6 days! We absolutely loved it! It was very  clean and had a nice kitchenette, saving us a LOT of money because we were able to cook some delicious meals and eat out less. On another yummy note, there are a bunch of coffee shops, pubs, bars, and outlet stores all with in a couples blocks of this studio's location on rue Crescent. We enjoyed getting a morning crepe or croissant from Paris Crepe right down at the end of the block once or twice! It's also a cheap cab ride away for rue saint Laurent if your looking to take part in Montréal's vibrant night life. My friend and I both like to walk so we did walked to both Old Montréal and Mount Royal on two separate days. However, if you're less keen on walking a couple miles for some good and fun exercise and get to know the city a bit, the metro station is just a block or two away. It's super easy to get around the city via public transportation especially from this apartment! I'd recommend this listing to anyone who's looking for a good central location to explore Montréal! C'est manifique! ","10"
" Très joli appartement, très confortable et bien situé, très propre, conforme aux photos.  Benjamin a été très accueillant et sympathique. ","10"
"Benjamin's home was beautiful and he was very accommodating! A convenient location and refreshing apartment made for a lovely experience.","10"
"Ben was an excellent host. He was very easy to communicate from the beginning of my book, and answered all the questions I had promptly. Ben welcomed me at the property, walked through the place, and recommended several places to visit in Montreal. 

Property is very clean and well maintained. It's located in downtown and served as a great access points to all the places I visited. A great experience and I would not hesitate to book again with Ben. ","10"

"We had an excellent visit at Benjamin's studio apartment! Benjamin was very friendly and easy to deal with and met us as soon as we arrived to the studio. The studio was exactly as pictured, beautiful, clean and in a great location. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Montreal! ","10"
"Our first Airbnb experience was fantastic. This apartment is everything you see in the pictures: simple, modern and functional! 

The location is also awesome. Close to so many restaurants and shopping. All forms of transportation are at your doorstep as well. (PS check out the Burger Bar! Best burger ever!)

Benjamin was accommodating with flexible check in and check out times, which was uber convenient. He is also a super nice person and made the experience very comfortable. 

Highly recommend this accommodation! ","10"
"I spent two weeks in Benjamin's loft style condo. It was in a perfect location to all the shopping, many restaurants, Old Montreal and Mount Royal.  It is located between two metro stops on the green line and close to a metro stop on the orange line.  
We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Cooking utensils, a few condiment basics and coffee/maker.
Everything in the loft was clean and well organized.  Washer/dryer and iron/ironing board came in handy.
I would not hesitate to stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone coming to Montreal.
Benjamin was quick to respond and very accommodating.  Thanks for a wonderful stay in Montreal!","10"
"Benjamin was a phenomenal host! He was very flexible with our schedule to meet us upon arrival as well as check out. His place is pristine! Exactly as pictured and a great location. 10/10 would absolutely stay here again.","10"
"Benjamin is an amazing host, very flexible with our schedule, always attentive and considerate, being very helpful on our first time using Airbnb and making our stay in Montreal very pleasant and enjoyable. The condo is just what we wanted for our trip, great location, close to 2 metro stations and walking distance to many restaurants and shops. In summary, an outstanding experience, totally recommended!!","10"
"Awesome place in an awesome city. The apartment was immaculate. The building is brand new. It was a spacious studio that was very comfortable for my fiancé and I. It came stocked with most of the normal living amenities from laundry detergent and trash bags to paper towels and olive oil. There was even a little coffee maker that I used every morning. Although there is an outstanding coffee spot Cafe Myriade just a couple blocks over that I highly recommend. Ben was great, always responsive and very out of the picture. It felt very much like a hotel experience (which is what we were looking for) at a fraction of the price.

The area felt extremely safe even late at night. It is at the intersection of a street of bars/pubs/clubs and the most high foot traffic shopping street in the city. It is central to everything. The 2 main subway lines are just a few blocks away. This is the ideal location for your first time in Montreal. Walking distance from Mount Royal.

","10"
"Benjamin's apartment was the perfect location in relation to the center of downtown Montreal. It was just far enough up the block that the business of the downtown streets didn't cause noise and close enough to walk EVERYWHERE! His apartment was immaculate and well stocked, and the bed was super comfortable. Wifi was easily accessible and the t.v. was very straight forward. The bathroom had everything you would need for a couple nights stay. ","10"
"Benjamin was a great host, he meet us there  exactly when he said he would,  and communicated and checked up on us ( text) throughout our stay making sure we didn't need anything else. he was a great host and if ever back in Montreal we will definitely stay here again ","10"
"Beautiful place and terrific host.","10"
"Benjamin nous a accueilli le jour de notre arrivée pour nous présenter le studio qui est conforme aux photos, de plus il est très bien situé dans Montréal. Je recommande vivement Benjamin et son studio. Équipements au top, et impeccable niveau propreté. ","10"
"Benjamin's place was perfect! The apartment was clean, well-equipped with everything we needed, and super close to great restaurants and shopping. The balcony was a nice feature as well. The gym downstairs is also very clean and was easy to access. If you are driving into Montréal, there is a parking lot a few steps away from the apartment, but it can get a bit expensive if you leave the car for more than an hour or so. Benjamin was a great host and was very flexible about check-in and check-out times. I would definitely rent from him again. ","10"
"Benjamin was a great host! He was very flexible with our schedule and meeting times. The apartment is exactly as shown in pictures which is great. It was very clean, comfortable, and everything we needed. It's located right beside Ste Catherine St which is great for walking and exploring Montreal. We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to everyone. ","10"
"L'appartement de Benjamin est absolument fantastique et je le recommande sans aucune réserve. Il est extrêmement bien situé (en plein coeur de Montréal: vous pourrez aller partout à pieds ou en vélo), il est aussi décoré avec beaucoup de goût et est très propre (ce qui est d'une importance capitale). Son appartement est également plus grand en vrai qu'il ne paraît sur les photos: d'une taille idéale pour deux personnes. Tout est neuf et l'appartement dispose de tous les équipements qui faciliteront votre séjour (que ce soit dans la cuisine ou dans la salle de bain ou encore la connexion internet). Son appartement a largement contribué à rendre notre séjour agréable. Je le remercie également pour sa grande disponibilité lors de notre arrivée puis lors du séjour. Enfin, l'appartement est d'un rapport qualité/prix imbattable. Ne cherchez pas plus et réservez le: c'est comme un hôtel en bien mieux!
For english speakers, in one word: fantastic. Do not hesitate to book it, benjamin's apartment is absolutely marvelous. 
Encore un grand merci à Benjamin! ","10"
"Benjamin's place was exactly as described through AirBnB and in his pictures.  Benjamin gave us great tips of things to see in the city, which was very walkable if you are up for a nice stroll.  Even the rainy weather couldn't prevent us from having a great stay.  I would highly recommend staying here and would do so again when I make it back to Montreal.  Thanks Benjamin!

Communication with Benjamin was excellent and he made everything very easy.

Would recommend host an the apartment. ","10"
"Would definitely stay here again and recommend Benjamin's place. He was was very accommodating when we needed to store our luggage for a few extra hours as the second place we were checking into couldn't get us in earlier. It was such a relief to be able to store our stuff and then enjoy the day without lugging our suitcases. He went above and beyond by being so accommodating with both our check in time and check out times. He was always prompt with returning any messages as well. Overall an amazing experience for our first Airbnb.","10"

"Benjamin's place is simply excellent. Helpful and accommodating host, very easy to communicate with. The studio is lovely, very comfortable and clean. Well situated close to plenty of shops, bars, restaurants and cafes around Saint Catherine Street. I wish we had been able to spend more time here and I would definitely recommend to any future guests. ","10"
"Nous avons adoré notre séjour dans ce studio. Tout est neuf et très propre. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Benjamin, c'est Carole qui nous fait faire le tour du studio. Nous avons eu un très bon accueil. Le batiment est à une minute de marche de la rue St-Catherine et à 5 minutes de marche de la station de metro Lucien-Lallier. La cuisine est complète il est donc facile de s'y faire à manger. La rue Crescent peut sembler bruillante, mais une fois la porte patio fermée on entend plus rien. Je recommande ce Airbnb absolument! ","10"
"The studio is superb. Very clean, tidy, well-decorated and has almost everything one needs. It is also incredibly well located and even though it is on crescent street which is full of bars, you are on the 9th floor and you don't hear it much especially with the double glazing. The place is very spacious. The host was very welcoming, helpful and available when needed. I would definitely stay there again if I had to visit. ","10"
"This brand new appartment was perfect for our week of exploring Montreal. It is conveniently located, well-equipped with everything you need and communication with Benjamin's friend Carole was excellent. Highly recommendable!","10"

Stayed here with my boyfriend and he loved it as well! The place was just perfect for the two of us. It had plenty of space with all of the modern amenities. Loved that there was a washer and dryer.

Very easily accessible as everything is in walking distance. 

Great restaurants and grocery stores very close by as well ","10"
"When my boyfriend and I arrived in Montreal Benjamin made it easy and convenient to pick up the keys. There was NOTHING inconvenient about staying at Benjamin's condo. It is in a clean, modern building steps away from St. Catherine's. There are many thoughtful things around the condo that we were grateful to find; including an umbrella large enough to cover two people. 

I was pleasantly surpised by the overall experience that the condo provided us... but the biggest surprise was when my boyfriend proposed to me on the balcony!! The fact that he chose that spot to pop the question should speak for itself.

"Ben's place made a great hub for our trip to Montreal.  His condo is perfectly located very close to many shops, restaurants, and bars. The Bell Centre is just a few blocks away and the public transportation was easy to use from our condo. Ben was waiting for us outside as we arrived and is very responsive when we contacted him at the airport. The condo has all the amenities of a nice hotel, and you will feel at home here while visiting Montreal. Highly recommend staying here while visiting this beautiful city. Thanks Ben! ","10"

"We spent 4 wintry days in Montreal and the comfort of Benjamin's place made it that much more magical. We truly felt at home and couldn't have asked for more from his accomadations and from him. Even after we had checked in, he was still available to answer questions about the city and things we could do! We'll definitely be back!","10"
"The stay was great!  Prompt communications and location was central to every major attraction in Montreal.  Highly recommended!","10"
"If you want to be in the heart of the city, this is the spot. One minute walk to St. Catherine St. 5 min walk to Bell Centre. 
Everything was perfect!
Benjamin met us promptly, showed us the condo and answered any questions I had immediately. 
We will be back!!
Thank you Benjamin!","10"

"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans cet appartement.
Guy s'est rendu très disponible et était très serviable. 
Nous reviendrons avec plaisir.

"Guy's place was great to stay at. He was easy to communicate with and the place was just as described. The only little hiccup was that we were told after arriving that we need to check out by noon even though on the listing it says 6pm. This was not an issue for us because we were going to check out early anyways but it would have been nice to know in advance and not after we got there.","9"
"Nous avons été bien reçu par Guy à notre arrivée, et il reste disponible pendant le séjour si on a besoin de lui. L'appartement est bien situé, proche des sites importants et des quartiers à voir. Il est bien équipé, et les lits sont confortables. Si je devais mettre un point négatif, ce serait au niveau de la cuisine qui aurait besoin d'un petit coup de neuf. 
Notre séjour a été agréable et nous recommandons ce logement.","9"
"My brother and I stayed at Guys for 4 nights. Guy was very easy to communicate with. Check in was easy and Guy's wife met us at the door. Guy and his wife live upstairs so it's very easy if assistance is needed. The apartment was as described in the website. It was very clean and well equipped. Two queen size beds were very comfortable. The bedrooms are at the back and very quiet. The location is perfect. In the Plateau and close to public transit and Bixis. We both enjoyed this apartment immensely and highly recommend. Perfect for two couples or travelling companions. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Guy!","9"
"nous avons été très bien accueillis par Guy et sa famille. nous avons profité pendant 3 jours d'un logement spacieux, agréable, propre, bien équipé et bien placé. sans aucune hésitation, nous recommanderions ce logement à des proches.","9"
"I loved this location and the home was beautiful and spacious.  The neighbourhood was quiet.  The only downside was the construction in the area caused transit detours that made public transportation difficult.   However, for its proximity to everything, I would stay here again and again!","9"
"Great time at Montreal,  Guy is helpfull host.Beatifull and spacius place.The Apart have everything close to all places in Plateau Mont Royal.","9"
"My three friends and I had a great experience staying in Guy's apartment. Guy was very hospitable in pointing out things we might need during our stay, providing maps and info, etc., and was flexible with our check-in and checkout times. He was very accessible in case we needed to ask him anything, as he lives right upstairs. The apartment was very spacious and just as represented in the pictures. We cooked in a few times and had everything we needed in the kitchen. We especially loved the neighborhood, which is very calm, quiet, and family-friendly; there is a primary school just across the street. It was a tiny bit further than we expected to get to the heart of downtown, but we felt like it was worth it for how great the place was; it was sort of a nice retreat from the busy city center Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone interested in visiting the city!","9"
"We enjoyed our stay in this flat and would highly recommend it to other travelers.","9"
"He was very nice. The apartment was very clean! Great guy","9"
"Guy est une personne très convivial et sympathique. Le logement est très bien située de tout. Une petite supérette à 2mn du logement ! Il est à 30mn du vieux Montréal et du vieux port , à 30 mn du plateau Mont-Royale. Beaucoup de petits restaurants situé près du logement et très bien pour la qualité prix! Notre petits coups coeur: chez ma grosse truie chérie, le bistrot rue de la rivière ( il faut réservé) la banquise pour la poutine!  Le logement est bien desservis par les lignes de bus, pensé surtout a faire de la monnaie 3 dollars 25! Ou acheter un passe pour votre séjour il sert pour le bus et le métro. ","9"
