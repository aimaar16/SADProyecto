"My stay in the comfy private double room was indeed comfortable! It's not just conveniently located in the middle of a great neighborhood, within walking distance from Mount Royal and a bunch of nice cafes and bars, but the hosts were very easygoing, helpful, and fun. I would totally do it again!",10.0
An amazing and enormous room at a total bargain price. Nice backyard. Great neighborhood. Friendly and accommodating host. I have nothing bad to say about it!,10.0
I had a FABULOUS stay! The room was enormous and just as pictured. You really cannot beat the neighborhood - walking distance to a ton of great local bars/restaurants/parks and easy access to the bus and the subway. The hosts were so gracious and helpful. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.,10.0

Laura is an outstanding host, and very accommodating! Thank you again for this first stay in Montreal!",10.0
"I spent 5 days at Laura's place, the apartment is large and looks just like what we can see in the photos. The bedroom is also very spacious, and the bed very comfortable. 
As for Laura and Anne, they are both very nice and make us feel right at home immediately. In short, we feel like we're at home. 
In the end, a great start to our stay in Montreal, thank you again to Laura and Anne.",10.0
"If I had to describe my stay at Laura's in one word it would be 'AMAZING'! Luckily, I have more space. 

The room is just as the pictures display: huge, clean, and comfy! There's a 2-person bed, a built-in closet, another closet with drawers, a bookcase, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the backyard, which Laura turned into a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). 

I've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually, I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. 

The neighborhood has everything you need. The house is near shops, supermarkets, cafes, restaurants, parks (including Mont Royal), several bus stops, two metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both a 10-minute walk away), and there's always some fun - often free - festivals around the corner in the summer. Despite all this, the street is actually really quiet and very safe!",10.0
"Laura was a brilliant host. The key pick-up was well-organized and I felt immediately welcomed into the home. Essentials/amenities were provided, which made it much easier. 

She also gave us great advice on where to go and eat. Overall, Laura was just an awesome host.",10.0
"I stayed there for a week during one of the many festivals in Montreal. Communication before arrival was great, and when I checked in there was a lovely handwritten welcome letter with instructions as the host was at work.

The room was as pictured in the listing, clean and bright, and the double bed was super comfy (I slept really well). The location was also great, right next to St. Laurent with cafes and restaurants nearby, and a large supermarket. 

Laura and her housemates made me feel super welcome in their home and would stay there again.",10.0
Super cute apartment with a great room! Laura was super welcoming and made my stay very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this place! I had a great time!,10.0
"Our stay with Laura was wonderful! The room was clean and homey, and the location was very central and interesting. Lilou was great at communicating with us about arrival and departure, and very friendly - providing us with some tips about what to do in the city. She really went above and beyond to accommodate us... I'd definitely recommend staying here!",10.0
"Laura was awesome to stay with! Her place is in the BEST location, in the artistic area of Montreal, very close to a bus station, grocery store, coffee shops, music bars and very good restaurants. The bedroom was so beautiful, clean, cozy and comfortable! I went to Montreal on my own and I couldn't choose a better flat/area in the city. As a woman you can walk wherever you want feeling so confident and safe!!! 

The whole apartment is so clean and beautiful! I got there just in time for good weather, and Laura was so nice to me, ready to answer any question of mine, every time I needed, by phone and in person. We also had a lovely chat together in her fantastic courtyard and she invited me to her tasty birthday party introducing me all her friends. She has been great to me!

If you want to go to Montreal, you absolutely have to stay at her place!",10.0
"The situation is great, the host very welcoming and nice. Absolute recommendation! :)",10.0
"The room was spacious and clean. Lucy was very welcoming and great to chat with! We only stayed for three days, so Lucy suggested some great places to eat and things to do.  Close to some great places to eat and shops.",10.0
"Laura is a very warm, welcoming and communicative host.
The accommodation is in a very pleasant neighborhood, the room is spacious and matches the photos. 
Her cat Lulu is adorable and very calm. 
We highly recommend it after two beautiful days spent in Montreal.",10.0
"Such a lovely space and host! Arrival was very easy, and the apartment and room I was staying in (the front room) were clean and well decorated. The backyard was a great place to chill out - very relaxing and private. 

The host, Laura, was very friendly and laid-back. The resident kitty was possibly even more friendly than Laura, and would monopolize your whole stay with her adorableness if you let her. 

The area is very close to bus routes, as well as some small coffee shops and restaurants, and of course the beautiful Mont Royale. The Mile-End neighborhood is eclectic and cute, with lots to see even if you're just wandering. 

I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to friends headed to Montreal.",10.0
Fantastic experience. Laura was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The room was comfortable and everything we needed for our week in Montreal. It was perfectly located to easily get anywhere we wanted to go within the city. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again next time I come to Montreal.,10.0
"I loved the neighborhood - pretty houses and cool cafes, and lots of young people on bikes. I really appreciate Laura's simple but tasteful way of furnishing her house. 

Laura is super warm and lovely, helpful, kind, and also gives you the space you need. 

The bed is very comfortable with lovely fluffy pillows. The room is really big and lovely.

I can't fault this accommodation at all. It's a fabulous inexpensive option.",10.0
"The accommodation perfectly matched the description, with a spacious bedroom. The location is ideal with restaurants, shops and grocery stores within 5 minutes walk. Laura is very friendly and cheerful; however, unfortunately she was not able to be very present during my stay. Just a few gusts of wind 4 or 5 times. Lulu the cat is an adorable old rascal. For my first Airbnb experience it has been very positive, in addition to having had an adorable French roommate during my stay.",10.0
My stay was great! Laura was so nice and everything was as described! Lovely location!,10.0
"Lovely room, great area, fantastic host!",10.0
"After living in Montreal for 3 years, I spent my last 4 months at Laura's place and I could not have hoped for a better way to enjoy this ending experience in Quebec. Laura made me feel home since day one. Living with her made my days happier and funnier, she's caring, full of energy, curious and interesting. She's very open-minded and used to meeting different people all the time. There's no way you could be bored having her around. 

If you're only visiting for a few days, she will definitely be a good advisor, she knows her city by heart. If you're staying longer like I did, the only risk is that you might have a heavy heart when it will be time to leave.",10.0
"The place was amazing and was located in a nice neighborhood full of cool vintage stores, restaurants, and bars. Laura was super nice and friendly. She made me feel so welcome and my room was clean, also the bed was comfy. Everything was just so great! I would definitely stay at Laura's again for my next trip to Montreal! :)",10.0
"Charming and helpful host, large comfortable room well located. 
A real nest of comfort!",10.0
"I stayed at Laura's place for 3 weeks and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Montréal! Laura was a fantastic host, so lovely and helpful, making sure my arrival was easy even though she was at work. The room was as pictured and very spacious, with plenty of space for luggage and a super comfy bed. The entire apartment is clean and spacious, and it was great having access to a washer and dryer. The apartment is in a safe neighborhood, located within a couple of minutes walking distance of the bustling Blvd St-Laurent. There are so many great restaurants, cafés and shops nearby (including a large supermarket a few minutes away) you are spoiled for choice. Mont-Royal metro station is only a 10 minute walk away to so you can be downtown in 25 minutes!",10.0
"First of all, the room is consistent with the photos and the apartment is very well located in the heart of Plateau. It's situated between Mont-Royal metro station and Laurier without mentioning the numerous buses nearby that will take you directly to downtown. 

Laura is a truly wonderful host, you can book with confidence!",10.0
"I felt very welcomed by Lilou and her adorable cats and kittens. Lilou treated me with a lot of respect and sociability, preserving my privacy which I needed at that time. 

Furthermore, I greatly appreciated her apartment which is clean, very quiet and well-located. The room was large and nicely furnished. I highly recommend this place :-)",10.0
"Great location, very comfortable room, very friendly hosts.",10.0
"Laura was absolutely the best. Check-in instructions were clear and the place was absolutely fantastic. The place was exactly the right spot for shopping and cool cafes to check out in the morning, as well as lunch and supper locales in the evenings. Literally one block from a bus that took me straight downtown if I didn't want to walk, which, when I wanted to, was straight down Boul. St. Laurent! The room was big and clean and quiet. I would have loved to stay longer!",10.0
"My stay at Laura's place was amazing! The house is spacious, clean, and cozy, and nestled in the heart of the lively, funky, and beautiful Plateau-Mont-Royal. Laura has an amazing way of making her place feel relaxed and friendly, and her guests feel welcome! Merci Laura, this was one of my best Airbnb experiences yet :)",10.0
"The room, the host and the location are magnificent!
And the cats too!

"My stay was wonderful, it was a great start and place to explore Montreal. I was made to feel right at home!",10.0
"I loved staying at Laura's apartment! Her place is spacious and clean, and she is super friendly and easy to coordinate with. I was arriving earlier than the check-in time and Laura made arrangements so that I could come in earlier and leave my bags in the room. The location of her place is ideal, surrounded by stores, cafes, and restaurants, and within walking distance of other cool neighborhoods. There is convenient access to public transportation (metro and bus), and I was able to get to all the areas I wanted to visit very easily. The room is huge with a comfy bed, closet space, a big desk, and a corner sofa. The rest of the apartment was clean and orderly, and I felt really comfortable throughout my stay. I would definitely recommend staying at Laura's, and I will certainly do so whenever I visit Montreal again!",10.0
"Airbnb at the top! Laura is super cool, the room is big, practical, there's everything you need. The location is great on a street of Saint Laurent, 5 minutes from public transport... Go for it without hesitation",10.0
"Lilou's place is located in a very lively neighborhood and not far from downtown (a 10-minute bus ride and a 30-minute walk). She is a very hospitable host and I felt at home during my two-week stay. Milton (the cat) is super friendly but not annoying. Try to visit some of her local restaurant recommendations; there are some great tips. Overall, this is one of the best Airbnb accommodations in Montreal.",10.0

4. Conclusion
The host was very friendly, which made it easy to relax. The house is so pretty that just looking at it makes you feel good. 
It would be even better in summer and fall because Mont Royal is close by, and the backyard is there too. 
Although not as close to downtown, Montreal is small and has a well-developed public transportation system, so it's not inconvenient to move around.  In fact, the neighborhood was quiet and had many cafes nearby, which made it easy to relax. 
Highly recommend!",10.0
"It's been a long time since I traveled alone as a single woman in a new city, and Laura was really wonderful and accommodating! It's a great stay, great location, and wonderful city.",10.0

"A warm and generous welcome, there's life and good cheer, you quickly feel at home, thank you Laura!",10.0
"Translation: I stayed at Lilou's house for three weeks and immediately felt at home. The house is very welcoming, beautiful and functional. Lilou has undeniable style. The house is located between my two favorite neighborhoods in the city: Plateau and Mile End and it takes only a few days to feel fully integrated into the neighborhood like a true Montrealese!! Less than 10 minutes walking gets you to the Laurier metro station and less than 15 minutes to the Mont-Royal station. Moreover, bus number 55 passes by in under one minute from the house and takes you downtown - old port in 20 minutes and Little Italy in 15. The neighborhood is full of cafes, art galleries, vintage shops and bistros where you can have dinner or brunch! It's truly a genuine place. Lilou is an amazing host... and her cat Milton is very sweet and friendly. The house has everything you need (website hidden by Airbnb) kitchen is well-equipped and in the living room there is a washing machine and dryer that can be used freely.",10.0
"The location of Lilou's place in the heart of the Plateau couldn't be better: really good restaurants just a block away (try Robin Du Bois!), a superb massage and bodywork business just around the corner (Place Nomade), a few blocks to the supermarket in one direction, a few more blocks to the natural food store in another direction, great ethnic restaurants in every direction, even an excellent hardware store in walking distance, not to mention big public parks (especially Mont Royal), about a 15-minute walk to the Laurier metro stop, Portuguese, Greek and Hassidic communities nearby, trendy bars, vintage bagel shops...etc., etc. A very fun area to be in. To stay in this Airbnb, you definitely need to be OK with cats, since the very friendly black cat who lives there considers herself the true owner. The bed was excellent, the kitchen very practical, the laundry machines in the basement easy to use, and Lilou herself is very friendly and welcoming and helpful.",10.0
"I spent seven perfect nights at Laura's. The location was awesome, as it was one street off of St. Laurent (a street with many neat shops and restaurants) and a ten-minute walk to the metro. It was also a short walk to Mile End where delicious bagels are. Although it was crazy hot outside, the apartment and bedroom were still very cool. The bedroom was large and the bed was super comfy. 10/10 would recommend and stay again!",10.0
"This was a great neighborhood and a beautiful, big, quiet space. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to enjoy Le Plateau and have a place to rest and relax at night.",10.0
"I absolutely loved staying here. Laura is super friendly and helpful, her apartment is somewhere you'd want to hang out in your real life, and the neighborhood is very walkable and has lots of interesting restaurants, parks, and shops.",10.0
"One of the most wonderful hosts I've had the chance to meet through Airbnb. I wasn't there for very many days, but the room was very spacious and I was very thankful for the laundry facilities! I even lost my purse with the house key and the host was super nice about it. The location is fantastic and I would highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Montreal!",10.0
"Laura is a kind hostess. We were both busy during my time in Montreal, but whenever I saw her, she was generous and caring. The house is beautiful and in a great location. The guidebook suggestions were very helpful.",10.0
"Laura is very welcoming, the house is very pleasant with a large bedroom and a pretty little courtyard. I had a wonderful stay there.",10.0
"What a gem. Although I'm not highly familiar with Montreal and its various neighborhoods, this wonderful home is close to everything I wanted/needed. Super hip neighborhood, a beautiful park not too far away, and so many lovely shops/cafes, if that's what you're into. There was a grocery store across the street and lots of bus stops nearby. The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It's ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it would be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid, it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn't make my stay any less incredible. The price is right and I cannot recommend this place enough!",10.0
"Thank you, Lilou!
I spent super nice days at Lilou's place. The room is big, bright and super comfortable. The house is big, has a super nice backyard and is very well located! 
It was a happy stay :) I recommend <3

The Metro is only a 10-minute walk away, and there are lots of bus stops nearby. If you like, you can easily walk to the city center or visit sights like Mount Royal. Laura is a very great host: super friendly and caring. She made it really easy for me to settle in Montreal and very quickly it felt like home! The room is very nice and bigger than I expected! The decoration of her place is very lovely as well! I cannot recommend this place enough!",10.0

Room faithful to the photos and good location. Cristina is very available for any information and very pleasant.,8.0
"We had an excellent stay at Kim's place! Her apartment is great, clean and very close to the city center. The street is still quiet in the evening for a good rest! Thank you again Kim, you are such a sweet person! 

Don't hesitate to do business with Kim, you won't be disappointed.:)",10.0
"The apartment was just as she described it and we really liked it. 
The neighborhood was safe and convenient for restaurants and transportation. Kim was very kind and communicative. Kim has a collection of records and listens to The Strokes a lot. We recommend this apartment if you are staying in Montreal.",10.0
"Teodora was an excellent host! She contacted me before our arrival to prepare us for the check-in process. She was very accommodating of our rushed arrival (we had dinner reservations!) and had a great printout with any questions we might have about her home. 

We really enjoyed her cat Tsitsou. I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. 

The location is great. It's less than a 10-minute walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!

One suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. 

I will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!",10.0
"On had an excellent stay at the lovely and welcoming Airbnb house. It was everything we needed, and it is also very close to everything!",10.0
Teodora was very friendly and showed us around her home and garden. Her home was in the perfect spot and it was very easy to get around in her neighborhood. Her home was very clean and exceeded our expectations. It was the perfect place to stay for a few nights!,10.0
The host cancelled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,10.0
"Fantastic place and host, Teodora was very helpful in listing some great places for us to check out.  Would certainly come back again! Tsi-Tsu was also adorable and a great companion",10.0
"Everything was very smooth, as accurate as the pictures. Antoine was available to answer questions before we arrived in Montreal. The apartment was comfortable, a great location (full of restaurants, shops, etc.), and had all the items to make you feel at home, with the free coffee being an extra touch",9.0
"Very easy to get to, and in a great location. Antoine was a great host who made sure we had everything we needed even though he wasn't in town. When the air conditioner stopped working, a replacement was promptly brought in. The apartment itself was very clean when we arrived.",9.0
"The apartment is very well situated. Close to many restaurants, bars, Mont Royal, cafes and pharmacies. Antoine was a lovely and accommodating host, I would certainly recommend him. He responded to messages quickly, was very flexible with check-out times and the place is very accurately described in the listing. Thank you Antoine!",9.0
Everything was good and matched the description! Antoine was super accommodating.,9.0
"Wonderful spot in a great location. There's plenty to do. Antoine was very accommodating and always there to answer questions. The place is clean, and he stored our luggage for us until we had to leave for the airport.",9.0
"It was great staying at Antoine's place for the week we were there. The location is good -- a bit far from the metro system, but we happened to stay during the week of Mural making it a really busy and exciting street to stay on. The space itself was decent with three rooms, one bath, and a kitchen. There is no sofa and the air conditioning was limited to the heat pump in the kitchen, but overall a great bang for your buck and a pleasant stay. Antoine was very pleasant, responsive, helpful, and accommodating.",9.0
"Spent 4 days at Antoine's place and it was great! Close to some really good restaurants such as Schwartz, Romados, and patati patata. Antoine was great with keeping the lines of communication open. The only thing that's really missing is a couch in the common area.",9.0
"Great location! Right in the heart of the action and close to everything else. The apt was a good size, nice and clean, with everything we needed. Antoine was very fast to reply to any questions I had about the booking. Very happy with this spot and would definitely recommend staying here.",9.0
"Our stay was fantastic. The location was absolutely perfect, with everything within easy walking distance. The apartment was clean and quite spacious for our group of five. The neighborhood is simply wonderful, and we would definitely come back again.",9.0
"Good stay at Antoine's place. The apartment is very well located close to many of the best restaurants and bars in Montreal and within walking distance to many sights. Perfect place and well priced for those who need 3 bedrooms and plan to mostly use the apartment for sleeping. As stated in the description, there isn't a living room but there is a large TV and table with chairs in the kitchen area. Air conditioning only in the kitchen, but will partially cool bedrooms if you leave all doors open (there are fans in each room, two rooms have windows that open, one just a skylight). Antoine is very helpful; we needed a parking spot for the weekend and he let us take the one he was in (free Friday-Sunday).",9.0
"The place was exactly like the photos. The location was very convenient. The most important thing for my family and me was that the apartment was clean. I didn't meet Antoine, but he left a detailed message on how to get into the apartment. A very good first experience with Airbnb.

Bonus: Netflix was available",9.0
"Perfect neighborhood with easy access via subway/taxis. Also, it had a lockbox for keys, which made it super convenient to enter and exit when we weren't together. Tons of restaurants and shops nearby; you can't really go wrong. Prompt communication and he was usually in the area if we had urgent issues.",9.0
"Excellent location and a cozy apartment. In the surprisingly hot Montreal days, the air conditioning in the kitchen wasn't sufficient to cool the whole apartment. Antoine was a very good host who quickly helped with any issues. I would definitely recommend it. Don't miss the all-you-can-eat No1 Sushi nearby...",9.0
"It's not exactly luxurious, but that's okay. The beds were fine, the WiFi was good, and the location is perfect. The front door opens right out onto St. Laurent, and you can walk to Schwartz's and all kinds of bars in minutes. The only strange thing to note is that the toilet is oddly close to an angled wall, so you can't really sit with your legs straight. All in all, if you're just looking for somewhere to come back and crash after a night of drinking, this place fits the bill.",9.0
"Antoine is a good communicator and will answer your questions. The location is convenient and has two decent-sized rooms; the third is cramped and lacks natural light. The air conditioner in the kitchen works well, and if you leave the bedroom doors open it helps a lot for hot nights. It's fine for a short stay if you are only there to tour the town, but there is no sofa or anything to relax on.",9.0
Great location in the bustling heart of the Plateau. Three bedroom set-up very convenient. Boulevard Saint-Laurent vibrant and full of bars and restaurants that are especially lively on weekends. Perfect communication with Antoine,9.0
"Great location. The lockbox with the keys was very helpful for our large group. The apartment was clean and tidy, basic but exactly what we needed.",9.0
"This apartment is very conveniently located - a five-minute walk to the base of Mont-Royal, a thirty-five-minute stroll to the river, you'll be surrounded by shops and cafes of every sort, and the residents of Montreal struck me as pleasant, patient, and engaging.

Our host immediately responded to any question or request and could not have been more helpful.

The stairway is a bit of a chore to negotiate and there is a bar below that caters to enthusiastic sports fans so if the game goes late you can hear their responses to great plays and bad calls.

The kitchen area functions well, there is a good shower, and having a washer and dryer unit is great!

I personally find the gray paint in the stairway and the white walls of all the rooms drab and boring, but that seems to be the norm for rental real estate. All in all, the apartment served me well and our host was charming.",9.0
"Antoine's place was lovely, very clean and cozy. A 10-minute walk to the Plateau, so close to shops and restaurants. We got comfortable quite quickly, perfect for a small group of friends or multiple family members. My friends and I had a wonderful stay!",9.0
"Great location, Pereira was very flexible and accommodated us well upon arrival, great spot for a group",9.0
"Cozy three-room apartment, with three people traveling for work, so we chose this apartment as the workplace is close to home. It's also conveniently located near the supermarket and various restaurants. The location is excellent. All kitchenware, washing machine, and dryer are fully equipped, WiFi is also fast, from a travel perspective, it offers good value for money. However, there might be some slight floor tilt due to being an old building, so if you're particularly sensitive to this, I wouldn't recommend booking. Otherwise, everything else is great, especially the key box which makes it convenient for multiple travelers to move around independently.",9.0
"Great place, great location, great space, this place is a must recommend if you want to explore the nightlife",9.0
He was very helpful! Easy to contact.,9.0
Absolutely PERFECT... cannot say enough good things about it... we will be back!!!,9.0

"The location can't be beaten. Easy access to downtown, and the host is very easygoing and easy to get in touch with. There are lots of restaurants right outside the apartment.",9.0

Nice location. A bit noisy. The place was not as clean as I expected.,9.0
Antoine's apartment is the perfect place to stay if you are traveling in a larger group and looking to explore Montreal. It is very centrally located in the Plateau neighborhood and also very close to Parc du Mont Royal. I would 100% stay here again if traveling to Montreal.  It was exactly as advertised.,9.0
Very clean and great location - wonderful overall experience!,9.0
Great space,9.0
"This is located right in the heart of Saint Laurent. Amazing location, better than expected. Easy access to everything you need. Antoine was a great host. Only downfall would be that the building and floor in the unit are not level and very uneven. Be careful walking up the stairs! Overall it was great. I would definitely recommend and stay here again!",9.0
"Great 3-bedroom property in a fantastic location. The host was incredibly responsive and addressed all of our requests promptly.

"The location is great and within walking distance of shops and restaurants. The apartment is large enough for 6 adults. The kitchen could use a little upgrade, and some comfortable seating in the living area would also help. It's a functional base for people who plan to be out exploring a lot, but not ideal for spending a night in.",9.0
"A terrific place to see a lot of Montreal. Really close and accessible to Mont Royal for walks, close to tons of cool restaurants both on St. Laurent and surrounding neighborhoods. Walkable to downtown or Vieux Montreal if you're up for it, or there's a Bixi bike rental right behind. 

We stayed there with 3 kids and 2 adults and there was plenty of space and the amenities were just what we needed. 

Just a heads-up if you have mobility limitations, it's two flights of stairs up and no elevator. Wasn't an issue for us but could be for others.",9.0
"This is a great value and it's accurate based on the description. The location is convenient and we received two sets of keys, which made a huge difference. The appliances were a bonus as well as the balcony. Definitely enough space for six of us. Highly recommended!",9.0

Lots of options for a late night Sunday dinner.... and great coffee shops too. Check-in and check-out was very easy!",9.0
"This place at Le Plateau is perfect. Close to the bus and metro. Near a supermarket, liquor store, and so many other amenities. So walkable. Sparkling clean and a really good space for 4 people.  I would definitely book again! And I hope to do so soon because I've really loved Montreal.",9.0

"Antoine's unit on St. Laurent Boulevard is perfect if you're traveling with a friend, with two bedrooms and a nice little room with a sofa, as well as an Apple TV and a kitchen with a washer and dryer included. It also has a small balcony around back that faces adjacent units' balconies.

Antoine ensured a clean apartment, and allowed us to check in very early and stay a little later than checkout. His responses were prompt and courteous. A great room for exploring Montreal or just spending a week. Restaurants and bars are within minutes of walking, and the famous Schwartz smoked meat is just a block or so away. 

Overall, a great location, a great host, and a great price! What more could you ask for?",9.0

Antoine was answering very quickly and handled a problem with the back door very quickly too! There are no condiments, it is something to note before coming  We had a very nice stay!",9.0
"The apartment is very well located and close to everything. We did everything on foot all weekend. However, I recommend bringing earplugs for sleeping because the rooms are facing the street and the proximity of bars leads to a lot of noise at night.

"The apartment is simple and okay. But we don't like the location. Maybe it's good for young people, but not suitable for a family. There's a busy street in front of the apartment, and many bars on the street that stay open all night long. You can hear a lot of noise from cars, people hanging out late at the bars. It's hard to sleep all night. The neighbors are most likely young people who keep making noise and partying until late at night...",9.0
"Fantastic location right next to great restaurants and vintage shops. Easy walking distance to everything. The host was very responsive, and check-in/check-out was a breeze. The apartment itself is minimally furnished but has all the essentials, which were more than adequate for us. The main living room area is well air-conditioned, unfortunately the bedrooms were not, leaving them feeling stuffy, especially when the doors are closed. Each of the rooms had a fan inside, but barely felt cool directly pointing it at us. One particular note that people should be aware of is having to walk up two flights of narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Overall though, great value for the location.",9.0

"The apartment matches the photos and description exactly. It was spotless. I love the location right on St. Laurent Blvd.: Convenient to restaurants, small grocery stores, and the bus (#55) that runs downtown.  Also, a taxi stand is less than half a block away, so getting back to the airport is no problem at all. The host was incredibly responsible and helpful.

**Note:** Any traveler with mobility issues: The staircase to this third-floor apartment is steep with very narrow steps, manageable for the healthy and agile among us... However, if you are unsteady on your feet for any reason, consider one of Gestion88’s other offerings in the neighborhood.",9.0

"Clean, easy to reach. For very tall people, bed feet can be a problem. The air conditioning doesn't really reach the rooms but at least ours had a fan. Intense and cold lighting. Super location of the accommodation. Consider bringing an eye mask to sleep if the light bothers you because one of the windows faces the stairs which are constantly illuminated.",9.0

"I had a lovely stay in Montreal. Titi's studio is cute, clean, cozy and warm. It is right by Place des Arts' tube station and it is close to a supermarket, shops, cafes, etc. The bus going to and from the airport stops just down the road, it is a 10 minute straight walk. Titi was prompt to reply to my queries when booking the place and also remained available throughout my stay. Titi had left some space in the drawers so I could unpack and I had the fridge to put my week's supplies. It felt very homely. Wifi also worked very well. I will happily book Titi's place again should I go back to Montreal.",9.0
"Our host was excellent and very accommodating. She and a friend met us to let us in and give us the keys fairly late which was very much appreciated. The location is awesome, the decor super cute.

"I had an amazing time in Montreal and it was made even better by this awesome corner unit apartment that was conveniently close to many of Montreal's main hubs.

Titi was so helpful! We needed to switch places, and with less than 24 hours notice she made it work for us to stay there. She was friendly and welcoming, and was timely with responses to our questions. Her place was inviting, bright and cozy. Everything was clean, parking tended to be pretty easy (although confusing in Montreal!), and the kitchen was stocked enough for us to cook up quick meals. The bed was a full-sized futon-like bed, which was comfy yet pretty firm. Overall, a great place to stay! We will definitely be back. Thank you Titi!",9.0

It is quaint and residential but very close to everything you need. Just a few short blocks to the metro gives you access to the whole city.

"The experience was very comfortable and Titi's little apartment is cozy with bright, welcoming colors. The place is basically a 5-minute walk from downtown, and parking was not too difficult to find either. We had access to wifi and the TV monitor which I easily connected to my computer with an HDMI. Titi was always there, a call away, if we had any questions. Although we weren't able to see her during check-in because we arrived quite late in the evening, she had turned on the AC and a fan so that we would have a cool room in the heat of summer. Also, there's a lovely balcony which is a nice addition if you're visiting during the spring or summer.",9.0

"Titi's place is a wonderful option for anyone looking to stay in the heart of Montréal at an affordable price. Her place is small, but quaint and clean and has everything you need as a solo traveler (would be good for couples too). Her apartment is only about 5 minutes walk to Place des Arts metro, which makes getting around the city super easy. Also, the fact that her place has an air conditioning unit is a nice plus during the hot summer months. Beyond that, communication with Titi was very timely and she was even nice enough to invite me to go out downtown with her and her friends on my first night there (though I ultimately wasn't able to due to other plans). Would definitely recommend this place and stay again in the future!",9.0

We were close to the metro, lots of restaurants, a grocery store, and everything you might need. 

The one thing we were not accustomed to, and this may be normal in Montreal, is the extreme firmness of the mattress. For those who are used to sleeping on softer mattresses, be aware that this will not be your experience. 

We had a lovely time and were happy to stay at Tina's!",9.0

She even left some fruit and treats in the freezer for us to make us feel welcome and we enjoyed pretending we were locals by ""living"" in her apt.  

Good space, comfortable bed and couch, and outside balcony to sit on made the apt. perfect. 

We plan to return to Montreal as it is probably our favorite city and we would definitely choose to stay here again.",10.0

"My husband, my 11-year-old son, and I had a wonderful stay at Toby and her sister Libby's place. The apartment is as advertised—very sweet with two small balconies, a full-service kitchen (including spices), and an air conditioner, which was a standout feature (and the latter was very helpful in July).  The thing is that you won't want to spend too much time there because the neighborhood is amazing—which was also accurately advertised. We walked or took the metro everywhere and never used our car (we were lucky and found a parking spot right after the street had been cleaned, and all the other cars had to move). There are so many great restaurants, cafes, and boutiques nearby, and also a sweet park right at the top of the street. We walked to Mont Royal (and then walked to the top for an amazing view), and walked to the Metro stop to get downtown (for free concerts at the Jazz Festival), the old port, and the Jean Talon market.  Libby was very helpful and available via email (and if my phone worked, I assume text as well); she has lots of maps and brochures in the apartment for you to look at and use; and her house cleaner, who met us and gave us the keys, was lovely and full of tips about the city.

It’s minutes away from the Mont-Royal Metro station which in turn gets you to Old Town and Downtown in 5-10 minutes.

"Zoe was very nice and very responsive to any questions I had. The place was very modern, comfortable, and clean. As a big clean freak, this place made me very comfortable with the cleanliness aspect. The only thing that was just a little frustrating at times was the lack of AC. Some rooms (at the front) were very hot if the doors were closed come morning time. However, seeing as most of us were out (not home) doing activities during the hot days, the nights were cool enough to open the windows, and Zoe provided a few fans, so it was manageable.

My friend was bitten by bed bugs in the smallest room. Also expect to not have any cups available. Don't even bother with finding parking. The location was not bad.",9.0
I highly recommend it!!! Very comfortable and super well-placed!!!,9.0
"Very nice apartment, like home, you feel good there. Zoé is very welcoming and attentive. Apartment well located. (Buses, metro, convenience stores...)",9.0
Awesome design. Transportation is easy almost everywhere. The neighborhood is very quiet and beautiful. It's a lovely place.,10.0
"Jen was very accommodating. The room was fine, though being an old building, you could hear conversations or people in the area. Great location, close to the metro, plateau, and Mile End. Lots of great restaurants nearby.",9.0
"Plateau Montreal Artisanal offers good value for money. The location is ideal, with an excellent selection of cafes, restaurants, and bars nearby. Public transportation is also close by. The accommodation was satisfactory and breakfast was great. This accommodation falls more in line with a guest house than a B&B.

"We really enjoyed our stay. Great location - close to BIXI stand, metro, shops, restaurants and cafes. Jen is super easy to get along with.",9.0
"We had a great stay at Jen's place, It was an old building but full of characteristics, close to the METRO and shops. The rooms were colorful with comfortable beds. Breakfast was excellent. Jen is very accommodating; I highly recommend Jen's place.",9.0
"I do not recommend this place. I arrived on a hot day, there was no air conditioning, the bed was much too small for a couple, the room is dark and not appealing at all. 

The room description is definitely misleading.

Not worth even staying for free!

"I stayed in Montreal for one night so my friends and I enjoyed Jen's hospitality! The breakfast was really good, thank you for everything",9.0
"This was a cute apartment in a very great location in Montreal. Jen was a very helpful and generous host. Breakfast was simple, but very delicious. My only complaint was that the room was on a fairly busy street and when you have the window open in the morning (which is needed in the summer), it can be very loud very early (~6am). Other than that, it was a great place.",9.0
"Jen's B&B is a fantastic place to stay. She is incredibly sweet, prepares breakfast with lots of love, the rooms and bathroom are super clean, great location and very independent, it is easy to feel at home. 

Also, you should try Jen's massage, she is amazing!",9.0
Great location. Nice breakfast. Jen was a pleasant and informative host. I am very glad I chose this for my first trip to Montreal and I would definitely do this again.,9.0
"Jen is an excellent host—very accommodating, makes a lovely breakfast with endless cups of coffee, and her rooms are always neat and clean. The location is perfect and within walking distance of many great restaurants and Montreal sights. Our room had a fan, but others might find the lack of air conditioning challenging in the summer. We had a really nice stay.",9.0
"It was perfect! The house is charming, and you feel like you are at home. Jen is very welcoming, and her breakfast is delicious. A wonderful host! 

I have already decided to come back... Thank you, Jen!",9.0
"We booked with Jen last minute and found her to be very cooperative and accommodating. The location is centrally located, right next to a subway stop and near everything Montreal has to offer. Jen made us a delicious bagel breakfast in the morning, and was very flexible with our check-in/check-out time.",9.0
The place was great. Jen was very hospitable and we had a really comfortable and fun visit to Montreal,9.0
"Great place, in a really convenient location, easy to see the city. On a lovely street full of restaurants and shops. Very nice building with old-school charm, very artistic feel. The beds were comfortable; the room was large and airy with a huge window. There was no air conditioning but the fan in the room worked great. Wifi and free parking were an extra bonus. Breakfast every morning was lovely. If I return to Montreal, I will stay there again.",9.0
"We were in town just for one night, and Jen's place worked out great! Very easy to get to, and everyone was very friendly.",9.0
"Jen was very welcoming and responsive. She and her friend provided a delicious and substantial breakfast in the morning. Nice neighborhood right on St. Denis. Large sunny room with a comfy queen mattress. Fun and funky decor, nice little terrace and kitchen. A couple of things: 1) There are two bathrooms - one with a toilet, the other with a sink and bathtub. The sink drained very slowly so was a little discouraging. The shower was fine, but the water pressure was a little low. 2) Our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARING woke us early in the morning. 3) Be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc., otherwise your door will lock! Maybe I'm fussier than my younger reviewers, but these are important to note. Otherwise, a very nice stay with friendly and knowledgeable hosts.",9.0
"Jen was a gracious host and very friendly. The accommodations were more than adequate, and breakfasts were delicious. We even got a free concert as a bonus.",9.0
"We strongly recommend this location. We would surely stay here again in the future.

NOTE: There are 3 rooms at this location. 2 of them face St Denis, and this is a busy street with traffic noise. The 1 room in the back, away from St Denis, is much quieter. This is our favorite room.

The location, one block from Metro/Laurier, is excellent. The building is from 1890, and has a lot of character. There are 2 flights of stairs to get up to the rooms.

Jen is a very welcoming and conscientious host. She went beyond our expectations and helped us with some issues with our room and the Airbnb website. We are most appreciative.

Breakfast was very good.

We stayed here for one week in 2 of the 3 rooms. (BTW: The beds in these 2 rooms are fold-out, and are a bit harder than we like.)",9.0
"This is a fine place to stay. Jen is calm, welcoming, and has a nice sense of humor.",9.0
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Jen's B&B. Rooms were airy and clean with an artistic feel that I fell immediately in love with. The B&B is in a great central location, surrounded by many great shops, restaurants, and bars, and near the Metro station. Jen is welcoming, enthusiastic, and warm. Yummy, filling breakfast was a great start to each morning!",9.0
"I really enjoyed my stay at Plateau Montreal Artisanal B&B. The room was just right, the bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent with metro and bike options just around the corner. There are some nice little restaurants across the street as well. I slept in each day and Jen and Theresa were very kind about leaving out my breakfast for me. I felt quite at home.",9.0
"Very well located, one of the best restaurants in town across the street, within walking distance to Montreal's vibrant life. 

The building is old but comfortable, with large rooms (ask for the one at the back side, it's very quiet).

Jen has been very accommodating, considering my impossible schedule! Great host!",9.0
"Loved the funky charm of this place...the colors, artwork, and ideal neighborhood made for a comfortable stay. Jen was a good host and made me feel welcome.",9.0
"Jen was very accommodating and helpful! We were delayed by 2 hours and arrived close to midnight and she waited for us to arrive and was very nice in assisting us in settling in. The place is located in a fun neighborhood, and right near the Metro. Highly recommend!",9.0
"Jen is very friendly and helpful, and the place is very relaxed, comfortable, and well-located.",9.0
Awesome location! Eclectic house that made us feel like we were living in the heart of Montreal. Great base for explorations. Jen provided great service.,9.0
"Jen's place is private, clean and very central to everything. 
I enjoyed staying there. Jen would come and visit every day (as she lives a few blocks away) and would have breakfast and fresh fruits for you in the morning. She was also great company and would have a little chat with you. 
I highly recommend your stay here if you're visiting Montreal.",9.0
"What an awesome place to stay in Montreal! So close to Laurier metro station, this Airbnb is the perfect way to simulate how locals live in this beautiful city. Jen was a great host; she pops in every day to make sure everything is okay in the house and you'll hopefully get to meet some fantastic guests as I did. If I ever go back to Montreal, I will definitely stay here because it feels like you're living in someone's home and the owner isn't home: )

If you are a light sleeper, I would strongly recommend asking for the back bedroom or the one in the middle (it doesn't have any windows so if you're a fresh air freak that might be something to consider).  I had the large room at the front and it was massive; I sleep with earplugs and a couple of nights the traffic kept me awake, but overall I loved staying here 100%.

Directions from the metro - when you get off the tube (if heading north on Montmorency direction), go towards the exit that doesn't have stairs visible. There will be an escalator and then a flight of stairs and exit at the Gilford doors. As you look right, this is the bus stop; I think they terminate here and it looks like a dead end street. There's a street that veers off to the left and at the end there are some traffic lights (you'll walk past some restaurants on the left, a pizza place on the corner on the right), when you're standing next to the pizza place, cross over the road (across the 4 lanes, not the crossing that flows with the traffic) and the door is basically right there in front of the lights. There's no sign indicating the name of the Airbnb, just keep an eye out for the door as it's a bit hard to see at first. It's between the shops and I walked past it the first time.",9.0
"This is a nice place to stay. Jen was helpful in telling us about places to go for food, music, etc. It's right on Saint-Denis, a good spot for restaurants and beer. Accommodations were basic but comfortable.",9.0
"I had a great stay! The location is excellent, near the metro, and it's in a really nice area. It was so easy to get around. I loved having so much common space to hang out in, and I really like the style of the B&B. There are a lot of neat instruments and art. I also like the make-your-own breakfast style (she makes sure the kitchen is stocked with nice fruit, bagels, eggs, etc) and having a place to cook if needed. Jen is very welcoming and checks in to make sure everything is okay. My stay was short, but staying here made my Montreal experience awesome.",9.0
"Jen went out of her way to ship some things we had left behind. She's a kind and gracious host, and her place is in a great location. 
I'd recommend this place to anyone.",9.0
"Jen is a very lovely and friendly host. She was easily contacted for questions and recommendations throughout my stay. Her B&B is in a traditional Montreal home and was very charming. The fruits and bagels were a nice and welcome touch! The only minor issue would be the fact that some of the rooms are right on St.Denis—so if you are sensitive to noise (e.g., traffic) you may want to ask for a room at the back or bring ear plugs.",9.0
"Great place, very cozy and relaxing at a great price.  Also, it's in a really cool area that was great to explore and very easy to get downtown. Jen is really accommodating and very sweet. Highly recommended!",9.0
"Jen was a lovely host. She has a very welcoming and easygoing personality and provided helpful information about the area and points of interest. The apartment is conveniently located; it's close to restaurants & nightlife, and also has a nearby metro line. 

There is a shared bathroom, but other house guests staying at the same time as us were very considerate.",9.0
"Jen has a really cool place that's super easy to find. It has fantastic old-style charm and the other people staying there were very friendly :) I recommend this place for sure if you want to take the metro, use Laurier station, but for the best restaurants nearby, walk in the other direction towards Mont Royal station :) :)",9.0
"We had a great stay! The location was perfect for us - a few minutes from the metro, and within 15 mins of our favorite cafes and pubs. I had anticipated that the house may be cold given its age (and the time of year), but it was nice and toasty. The house is pretty creaky, and there was a fair amount of noise from the street, so if you're a light sleeper it may not be for you.  We didn't find it a problem, and would definitely stay there again.",9.0
"Jen's Artisanal B&B is an artsy, shabby-chic multi-dwelling home right on Rue St. Denis in Montreal. As such, it is perfectly situated between the English-speaking/hipster side of town and then French-speaking side of town. Moreover, the inn is an easy walk to Mont Royal park, old town, and to most of the major attractions in the city center. For any further out destinations, you will find yourself a mere block away from the Laurier Metro Station. All amenities were provided by Jen, including bagel breakfasts, internet access, bedding, towels and basic toiletries. Accommodations were perfect.",9.0
"We arrived at this two-story residence easily from the Amtrak station. Jen was home when we arrived to let us in. She showed us around briefly and then let us be on our own. Despite sharing the building with other guests, our room was very private. We were very comfortable and the location in the city is very close to restaurants, cafes, and Metro stations and bus lines. We had a great stay! Recommended for couples or families with children.",9.0
Jen runs a very pleasant bed and breakfast in a wonderful and convenient neighborhood of Montreal. She was very reliable both in her communication before our arrival and in setting us up for a lovely stay. We would love to stay again!,9.0
"I am so happy to have chosen this place. I'm a DJ who drove from Vermont to Montreal for a gig that ended at 2am. Jen met me at the B&B at 2am, with keys in hand and a pleasant smile. My room was clean and I fell in love with the Frida Kahlo-inspired bathroom. It was super clean and warm during those wintry nights. Great deal.",9.0
"Jen's B&B was the perfect place for our first Montreal (and Airbnb) experience. From the start Jen was quick to respond and helpful with information. She is a great host and seems to run the B&B professionally. We had to postpone our plans due to a snowstorm but Jen could accommodate us a day late with no problem, which was much appreciated. The Mile End area was a great location to get a well-rounded idea of the city; we were really happy to have ended up there instead of some other locations we were considering. The house is old but it has tons of charm. We were lucky to have the whole space to ourselves the first night after a full day of walking around, we made dinner in the kitchen and spent the evening playing with instruments in the living room. The next night there was a full house which got a little noisy due to echoing voices and creaky floors, but really not a problem. This may be petty to mention but I would recommend bringing your own pillow if you prefer sleeping a little elevated. Overall it was a pleasant, fun, and hassle-free visit to Montreal; we would definitely stay here again!",9.0
"Good location in the vibrant Plateau neighborhood and a vintage spot. Metro station nearby. Jen is not living in the apartment, so if you need advice for your stay, prepare questions when you meet her on the first day. Breakfast was very basic. Generally, we promote it for young travelers.",9.0
"Jen's place was great! The location especially. Everything was right around the corner, just brilliant. 

The room was comfortable and Jen left bagels and cream cheese out each morning for breakfast, YUM!!

I would thoroughly recommend it.",9.0
"Excellent location just a short distance from the metro and within walking distance of many places on Rue St Denis and Mont Royal.

Breakfast provided was greatly appreciated, and Jen responded quickly to all our requests. 

This was our first experience with an Airbnb flat, and Jen has set a very high standard for any future hosts we use. Thanks, Jen",9.0
I felt very comfortable in this beautiful space! The location was convenient in the Plateau.,9.0
"Jen was very helpful, especially in figuring out Montreal parking regulations, and the accommodation was in a nice historic building and great location.  As mentioned by others, the short helpful guide that was left in the room was also nice to have.",9.0
"Jen is a fantastic host! The B&B was really nice and conveniently located near everything: the metro, Bixi bikes, shops, Mile End, Little Italy, and Outremont... It was very cool to stay in this authentic place during my week-long conference in Montreal.",9.0
"Thank you, Jen, for your opinion about us.

Regarding the trousers, is it possible to get them next Saturday around 1 or 2 pm?

I'm having problems with my phone's web connection. We are currently in Quebec City.  Could our guess, Anick Gosselin, please call you tonight?

Thank you very much,
Bernard",9.0
"I stayed for 3 nights at Jen's place. I felt at home right away and experienced Jen as a flexible and friendly host. So yes, I definitely recommend staying at the B&B!",9.0
"Jen's place was great! Very well located in the Plateau and close to a metro station for further city exploration. Jen welcomed us, took the time to show us around the house and answered all our questions. She also showed us travel books on Montreal and the surrounding area for guests. We also appreciated that she gave us directions for free parking near the house. That was super helpful! 

On the downside of things, a little general cleaning of the place would be useful to make the overall experience excellent.",9.0
"We really enjoyed our stay at Jen's. The flat has character and feels like home, decorated with good taste. The place is ideally located and very close to nice bars and restaurants. We appreciated the morning bagels very much! It was a very good experience and Jen was perfect with communication! We would love to go back!",9.0
It was a very charming place in a large part of the city. There was nothing negative to say about it.,9.0
"Jen was an excellent host. She was super nice, helpful, and gave us a lot of information about Montreal. The place is in a fantastic location, close to everything. Wifi was great. I recommend this place if you're on a budget but want easy access to all that Montreal has to offer!",9.0
"Excellent location! Lots of great restaurants and shops nearby. Just a short walk to the Metro. Jen was very helpful with navigating the city and public transportation. Overall, great! Thanks again!",9.0
"Quirky place in the absolute perfect location. Tons of boutiques along the same street, and walking distance to most places worth seeing. Jen was a genuinely kind host and willing to offer advice on the area. Plus, I met two really awesome travelers at the B&B... seems to be a place that attracts interesting people!",9.0
"We had a great experience at Jen's B&B! Went up to Montreal for the jazz festival, and Jen's place was a great deal. Not expensive, perfectly clean, and above all well-situated in the city (one block from the subway and located in the Plateau area with lots to do/eat nearby). The only drawback was that the B&B wasn't air-conditioned (same goes for many buildings in Montreal), but it worked fine for us because we got the one room with the AC unit.",9.0
Great! Awesome!! Fantastic!!! Very nice and colorful house in a great place.,9.0
"Jen was an excellent host! She was very flexible about our late arrival and gave us some great information about the neighborhood and tips for getting around Montreal. We didn't see her for the rest of the weekend, but she was available via email or phone in case we needed anything. The room and house were beautiful and we especially enjoyed the delicious Montreal bagels for breakfast. Thanks Jen!",9.0
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Plateau Montreal B&B. This is a lovely old apartment – large, bright, full of Quebecois character, and very well located just a short walk from the Laurier Metro. The shared bathroom and common areas worked well for me as I enjoyed socializing with the other travelers and felt very safe and comfortable. Our host Jen was welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed. This was my first Airbnb experience, and one I would gladly recommend to others.",9.0
"Apartment very well located in a very pleasant neighborhood
Comfort quite modest, well suited for young people
Good value for money
Pleasant contact with J'en",9.0
"The room is ideally located, close to the metro station, in a dynamic and very lively neighborhood at night. The house has charm and is clean. We had a little impression of being in a hostel, several rooms are rented with different neighbors every day. Jen is very friendly but doesn't live on-site, so you need to call her and make an appointment upon arrival.",9.0
"Charming and quaint location. The owners do not live on-site but were there to welcome us.  

Well-situated, the only downside is that our room looked out onto Rue Saint Denis which was quite noisy at night.",9.0
This was our first Airbnb and Jen was really friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay in Montreal and felt the location was perfect as a base for exploring the city.,9.0
"Jen's room worked out fine for me. The location was perfect, an easy short walk to the Laurier Metro stop and Bixi bikes, on St Denis, close to Mont Royal and St Laurent. Breakfast was strictly do-it-yourself: bagels, cream cheese, and orange juice provided. There was a bathtub which was important to me and which I enjoyed. An air conditioner and fan kept the room cool.",9.0
"Jen and her husband have a charming, colorful house that they leave with the other guests. Our room was facing the street but not noisy at night. 

A good address well located to visit Montreal!",9.0
"Well-located apartment with the metro at the foot of the building, or you can reach the city center on foot in 25 minutes.

Beautiful colorful and clean apartment.",9.0
"I felt well attended to, the only downside was the front room near St Denis that was so noisy until at least midnight.",9.0
"We had to wait 15 minutes to meet Jen for check-in. However, she was supremely flexible in the first place, allowing me to set the check-in time and only a day before arrival. The floors squeak quite a lot as do the doors, at least to our room ""The Plateau."" It's all pretty great after that though.  The room had a working fan AND an air-condition window unit. The windows are huge and easy to open, good drapes to boot, they were easy to snap open and close. Easy access to a vegan and raw food restaurant, 15 min walk. Fully stocked kitchen with tea, fruit, bagels; great bathrooms.  I would definitely stay here again. Thank you for the effort Jen!",9.0
"I enjoyed my stay at Jen's place. Her place is clean and conveniently located near a metro station. Jen was also very helpful and accommodating - prior to me arriving, she helped to provide very clear instructions on getting to her place from the airport. And on the day I left, since I had a late flight, she allowed me to store my bags in a spare room so that I could still explore around during the day, which I very much appreciated!",9.0
"Nice place, great location!",9.0
"Excellent location for this two-story house, original decoration with a bohemian touch. Welcome by Jesse, Jen's companion. Friendly and cool. I only stayed one night. Jesse kindly offered to stay until 2 pm the next day exceptionaly, as I had spent the night being sick. Attention that I really appreciated.",9.0
"Jen's place was perfectly located. Clean, bright and comfortable, I highly recommend this location for anyone traveling through Montreal. Jen was also very accommodating with late arrivals and late check-out times, which my travel plans included. Two thumbs up!",9.0
"Jen saved my life and my kid's! We made a last-minute decision to go to Montreal for an event. While there, I sent various inquiries and while most people responded that they needed more advance notice, Jen responded that her place was ready and available! (There are various rooms rented.) And the location in the Plateau area is fabulous! If you're not looking for the Hilton, then this place is quite comfortable and convenient. And to top it off, Jen provides the materials to make your own tea, coffee, and bagels for breakfast. That was just an added bonus. We will definitely return on future trips!",9.0
"Comfortable and quiet, we did not meet Jen but her husband Jesse was very welcoming. Lovely place for a night and very central.",9.0
"Jen was a friendly and helpful host, our accommodation was unique and in a great location. We had a wonderful family day weekend in Montreal.",9.0
"Jen was great at accommodating my partner and me at the last minute, which was a relief! The place was very colorful and had fun items, like guitars and a ukulele. It was nice having a kitchen where we could cook. The place is in a great location in Montreal - close to Mount Royal and directly on a busy street with tons of nice places to eat and yoga studios, etc. The bus station is a one-minute walk, too! Our only complaint was that the place did not appear to be cleaned very well - if you like things to be really clean, you probably wouldn't want to stay here. The place was well loved, but not in a cleaning sort of way.",9.0
"Great price for a bed in a great location. The Plateau neighborhood is awesome.  If I'm being picky, the pillows are flat. The bagels were great, and the apartment had a lot of character.",9.0
Thank you Jen! This was the perfect accommodation for my night in Montreal,9.0
"We had a really nice stay at Jen's place.

This colorful house is comfortable and perfectly located!

Jen is sympathetic and really accommodating.

We clearly recommend it!",9.0
Jen's house is colorful and well-situated to visit Montreal; I would highly recommend it!,9.0
"We spent four days here and everything was great. It's a beautiful old apartment with several bedrooms and a spacious common area downstairs, with a kitchen and living room. Right on St-Denis, it's quick to get on the metro and you're in a great neighborhood for walking around. Jen is a great host, friendly, and leaves you to your own devices.",9.0
"The room was clean and tidy. Jen made accommodations without hesitation (thanks for the towels!). Even with a second guest down the hall, the place was quiet and allowed for a lot of privacy. 

Bagels and coffee in the morning were a nice touch. Will stay there again!",9.0

Disappointed that I didn't make time to get a massage from Jen, the host.",9.0

Great place. Very convenient and wonderful overall. Would definitely stay again.,9.0
Nice place to stay and close to everything you need in Montreal. I would come back!,9.0
Everything was great at Jen's. Jen had some good tips for us about Montreal and was very friendly.,9.0
"Great host and apartment in a superb location! Jen was very friendly, the apartment was clean and the fruit and bagels for breakfast were a nice extra touch!

Thank you so much, I will be back on my next trip!",9.0
"My friend and I loved staying here. The location is amazing and the vibe is like a cool, eclectic hostel that allows the privacy of your own room. I loved the lending library (with Montreal tour books!) and Jen was nice enough to leave out tea, Fairmount bagels, and fruit for guests. The only downside for me is that I found the mattress uncomfortable. That being said, I am really picky about sleeping surfaces and generally don't sleep well on any kind of futon mattress. My friend slept just fine and had no complaints.",9.0
"Jen was an excellent and helpful host! She was very friendly at check-in and offered excellent suggestions for places to eat and things to do around the neighborhood.

The location of the Airbnb couldn't have been more perfect, extremely walkable to many restaurants and shops! First time in Montreal, and feel very lucky that friends who had stayed at this location recommended this Airbnb to me. The BIXI bike share system has many docking stations near the Airbnb location, and the Laurier Metro station is just a couple blocks away. The maps and guidebooks in the apartment were great to have as references!",9.0
"I would describe this property more as a ""hostel with delicious bagels"" than a ""B&B,"" but that's perfectly okay. What it does well, it does really well! We had the room pictured in the Airbnb profile and it was nice—a good size, and clean. The rest of the building is older, a bit shabby, but definitely clean and more than adequate. There is one bathroom and several other bedrooms that are rented out. Getting bathroom time and hot water were never a problem, even though others were staying. The kitchen and other common areas, including the back garden balcony, are nice too.

This Airbnb stay was a little different in that we didn't interact with the hosts much. We actually never met Jen. Instead, her husband Jesse met us and let us into our room. He was welcoming and showed us around. There was also a handy welcome sheet in the room with wifi info, restaurant suggestions, etc. (The pizza place across the street is great!)

The neighborhood is fantastic, and definitely what makes this place such a great deal. It's very close to the metro, restaurants, and a little grocery store. If you like walking vacations, you can definitely walk downtown or to the old city from the location. 

It was a good place to stay, and I would recommend it to others.",9.0
"Our stay at Jen's was fantastic! The B&B was beautiful and very cool, there was awesome art everywhere in the house! Jen was very accommodating and nice! She also gave us great advice on where to check out some cool bars and an awesome vegan restaurant! We were also close to everything:D Thank you Jen for such a great trip... and the bagels!",9.0
"The house is located on Rue St. Denis, a busy street with many shops and restaurants. It is also quite close to Laurier metro station.

The house itself looked more like a hostel than a house; it was shabby, needed repairs, and a good cleaning.",9.0
"Easy email contact to Jen and nice welcoming by Jesse. I liked my room for the 2 nights. With my earplugs I could sleep quite well despite the traffic noise. Self-service breakfast is ok for me. Other people may need a hint at the Airbnb description. All the best, Heribert (Germany)",9.0
"We had a lovely trip to Montreal while staying with Jen. The B&B is in a wonderful location - close enough to walk downtown, and surrounded by many, many delicious restaurants and bars. We used bixi to get around and there were several stops nearby. The room was a nice size and the bathroom and kitchen were kept clean during our entire stay.",9.0
"Jen was very nice! The location is fantastic and everything is true to the description. I stayed for about a week and it was great to have an apartment-like feeling rather than a hotel, you can really make yourself at home. The living area is really nice with a sunroom and living room, great for reading or making coffee and doing some work in the morning. 

Cleanliness-wise, it could be a little better - it wasn't horrible but the room could have used a dusting, and the closet had a slightly musty smell.

All in all, I would recommend it for the location and the bed and breakfast setup - needless to say, I ate a lot of bagels!",9.0
"Nice place, clean and quiet",9.0
"My partner and I enjoyed staying at Jen's place. She was a good host, she was there to greet us warmly when we arrived, giving us plenty of tips on parking, eating out, or visiting places. 

The location itself is great, in the middle of the Plateau with many small cafes, bakeries, and nice restaurants around. It's also within walking distance of Mont Royal.

The place has a lot of character and despite the room colors didn't look as vibrant as I was expecting from the pictures, it still looks funky and has a nice vibe. 

My only issue was the street noise plus some noises on the first night, as someone was going in and out from the room next door and the door was banging. However, I slept perfectly after wearing some earplugs, plus I know I'm quite sensitive to noises.",9.0
"Jen was fantastic; she was incredibly accommodating with any changes I made. The location is in the heart of the city and right next to all the bars, restaurants, and nightlife activities. It's extremely accessible via train for quick and easy travel throughout the city.",9.0
The strength of this apartment lies undoubtedly in its location. It is two steps from the Laurier metro station.  It is a 5-minute walk from the St-Denis/Mt-Royal intersection. There is no better place to stroll on the Plateau!,9.0
"Jen was very welcoming and helpful. We spent a good time there. The apartment was shared with other travelers. We felt like we were in a youth hostel. The apartment was well-equipped and we had everything we needed. Breakfast was included, which is a nice perk.

Thanks!",9.0
"A nice stay. The location is simple, clean, and central.",9.0
"Jen is a very good host, taking her time to show you around the place and answer all your questions. The room is spacious and well located at Rue Saint-Denis. Definitely recommend it!",9.0
"Very warm welcome, Jen makes you feel right at ease immediately. The apartment is located on the Plateau, close to transportation and various places to go out. I only stayed for a weekend, but it was a very good experience that I would like to repeat.",9.0
"Jen was an excellent host! She was accommodating of my late arrival time and helped me navigate the streets of Montreal to find parking, which isn't easy. When I first arrived, she gave me a tour of the lodging, which matched what was described on the listing page, and even had a laminated quick-tips sheet with house rules and some helpful tips for getting around the city. I would be happy to stay here again.",9.0
"Jen was an excellent host and flexible with our delayed arrival time. Although we didn't meet her, she was quick to answer the phone when we had questions. The apartment was comfortable and welcoming. Breakfast was a really nice touch. I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to others who want to be in a great location and a funky clean apartment.",9.0
It was a pleasure staying at Jen's place. She was very helpful and the room was lovely. The house's location was also excellent; 100% recommended.,9.0
"Fantastic position, close to the station and all amenities. Although the house was lovely, it needed a clean, nothing major just a bit dusty and the bins weren't emptied during our stay. Check-in was easy, and Jen was very flexible with our late and changing check-in time.",9.0
"Jen's place was funky, clean and well located. A great spot to stay in Montreal!",9.0
"Excellent place to stay in Montreal. It is very convenient and close to the metro station and bus station. And also, it is a safe place to stay even though you come back at midnight from the metro. The host is very nice and considerate. I will choose this place when I visit Montreal again.",9.0
"Jen's B&B was a lovely place to stay! It's in a great location, easy to walk through the Plateau and Mile-End neighborhoods, and was clean and comfortable.",9.0
"Dave and I both loved staying at Jen's bed and breakfast. It was exactly what we were looking for. It was so charming and colorful. It was nice having access to the bagels and tea. Jen and her husband were very helpful with finding parking when we arrived so that we could avoid getting parking tickets.

The bed and breakfast was located in a great area - it's an easy walk to plenty of great restaurants and Mont Royal. We walked almost everywhere, but there was a metro stop very close. We would definitely stay here again!",9.0
"Jen's place is in a great location, very close to public transport, great restaurants and shopping. The house has a lot of character and charm, I recommend sitting on the back balcony with a cup of tea in the afternoon! Our room was a little dusty, but apart from that the place was generally pretty clean and as described in the listing.",9.0
"Excellent location, great price! Classic old-style Montreal apartment with creaking hinges and all. Very laid back, only one other couple staying that weekend. Had the kitchen and back balcony to ourselves when we were there. Food, Bixi bike rentals, bistros, and depanneurs... all within a block or two. Great if you're just looking for a taste of city living.",9.0
"Jen's place was easy to get to from the Metro, and she was there to greet us when we arrived. She was very friendly and gave us several recommendations for restaurants/pubs in the area. The place itself was funky and quaint. It's definitely an older apartment, but for the price and the location, it's worth it. As a bonus, Jen kept local bagels stocked in the kitchen for breakfast!",9.0
"She was going out of town the day we arrived, but she was still able to show us around the apartment. The description of the place is accurate, no frills. The neighborhood is THE BEST part about this place.

The only thing that caught us by surprise is that the toilet and the rest of the bathroom are in two different rooms. So at one point I wasn't able to use the bathroom to wash my hands after using the toilet because someone was in there...but that only happened once.

And one thing that was slightly irksome for me personally was one of the pillows that had little support, but I'm also used to thick, fluffy pillows, sometimes stacking one top of the other; so take this part of the review in with a grain of salt.

We were really looking to just crash for the night and take in Montreal as much as we can, so we weren't in the house very much. It was very low-key and enjoyable.",9.0
"After traveling the world and staying in hostels, the warm, thoughtful reception at Jens place was a breath of fresh air. So obvious that she's an experienced host who is used to dealing with travelers and their needs.  Caring, thoughtful host with a well-kept room in a fun, funky neighborhood with rock bottom prices... what more could I ask for?",9.0
"10/10 would recommend!

Great place, plenty of character and artsy feel as well as space (rare to find in the plateau), the pictures didn't do the room justice as it was bigger than expected. The location is just amazing being so close to the metro, as well as the plateau being such a desirable place to live. Also, the A/C was a godsend on the couple days where it got really hot!

There was an issue with the tub at one point but it was fixed very quickly.

There were a couple other girls renting separate rooms and we all got along and I even ended up making close friends with one!

Jen was just great, she made sure we were comfortable, let us know all the spots nearby, came by to clean and was quick to respond, super accommodating.",9.0
"Had a wonderful stay! A great, safe place for a single traveler like myself. The location was perfect and the price was very affordable. I highly recommend it for budget-conscious solo travelers!",9.0
"It was nice to stay here for the week, close to the subway and restaurants! The host was very nice and my roommate for the week was also nice.",9.0
"The studio is nice and comfortable, located just next to Rue Saint Denis. Maria was very helpful and responsive. She prepared everything perfectly! We had no problems finding the place and getting around.",9.0
"As for location, you can't get any better! It's in the heart of Montreal. A short walk from le Vieux Port/Old Montreal (1.5km with a slight hill). Be forewarned that since it's in the middle of downtown, it's not going to be quiet. This is no fault to the hostess, just that this city rarely sleeps - which, depending on who you are, is a blessing or annoyance. Laundry is 10 blocks away since the hostess isn't in town, the sheets may not be clean so you'll have to do them yourself. Maria is always available via text so very helpful. If you drive, underground parking is a block away. Rental bikes are also close by. I would definitely stay there again for a quick weekend visit to Montreal.",9.0
The host left a pleasant note with some directions about the wifi and wished us a great trip. The description matched the room perfectly. The neighborhood was lively and exciting!,9.0
Good home base!,9.0
"Ultra-quick confirmation, fast communication and an apartment that perfectly matches the description. Excellent host.",9.0

Cons: Not suitable for light sleepers (noisy refrigerator, noisy entrance door that residents tend to slam).",9.0
"Very convenient and flexible. Thank you, Maria",9.0
We had a great overnight stay here. The location is perfect and Maria left us with everything we would need for a comfortable stay. She was very quick to respond when we had a question about parking. We would love to stay at Maria's again next time we're in Montreal :),9.0
Host able to have key ready early thanks,9.0

"My husband and I stayed at Celine's studio on Rue Dolbeau for a few days at the beginning of August. It was a perfect setup! The studio was comfortable, immaculate, and close to public transportation, taxis, and places to grab a bite to eat. This was our first time using Airbnb so we were a little nervous, but Celine was an ideal host! She was easy to communicate with, kind and welcoming.  She even left us some coffee to brew in the mornings. Celine is wonderful and so is her place!",9.0
The reservation was cancelled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0
"Nice large studio in a quiet area. Very close to a bus stop which can take you towards the eastern part of the city, fairly close (~15 minutes walk) to a few subway stations. Fairly cheap for that time of year, considering what you get.

The host was very nice and responsive. Our flight was delayed by 2 hours so we got there at midnight and our check-in was still very smooth.",9.0
"Celine was an excellent host. She accommodated a last-minute reservation and an early morning check-in and went out of her way to solve minor house issues. The place was clean and well-supplied with utensils, coffee/tea, and all the things needed to make it easy to live away from home for a few days. The location is close to public transit and a nice 24-hour farmers market. The bed is a futon - so not perfect for everyone. Overall, good experience.",9.0
"Tyler was a great host and responded very quickly. The apartment was very clean and located in an amazing neighborhood close to many shops, restaurants, and subway stations. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone!",9.0
"Tyler was amazing, friendly and very accommodating! The apartment was clean and in an excellent location, walking distance to restaurants and all areas of the city. We really felt at home and we would definitely love to stay here again on our next trip to Montreal! Tyler ensured that we were happy during our stay and we would definitely recommend him to anyone!",9.0
"Good location and great apartment; just as described. Didn't meet Tyler but information was clear and check-in went smoothly. Small issue with the parking spot but in the end we managed to leave the car there during our stay. Think we managed to pick out the coldest day of the week so after exploring the city we enjoyed a cozy night in, watching Netflix :) Would definitely stay here again if we return to Montreal.",9.0
"Tyler's apartment is located in downtown Montreal at a very convenient location. There are numerous bars and restaurants in the area, and the metro is only a few blocks away. This made getting around really easy.

The apartment itself is lovely. Spacious, well-lit, and clean. It even has Netflix for the time you spend indoors. All this helped to make our visit pleasurable. 

While Tyler was not around, he provided all the details required for us to access the apartment via text. This went off without a hitch. 

Oh yes, there is a dedicated parking space too. Which is always a bonus when you have a car in the city.

Overall, I would definitely choose to stay here again when I visit Montreal. Thanks Tyler!",9.0
"Tyler was very friendly and welcoming. He's prompt in his replies and provides excellent dining and drink suggestions. 

His apartment was great, too. Clean and tidy. The location is perfect, with many eateries and bars nearby. Parking was also conveniently located near the apartment. 

Thanks for having us!",9.0
"We had an amazing stay at Tyler's place, the location is perfect and everything is easily accessible on foot or by public transport... The apartment seems to have been recently renovated and has a modern and stylish decor.",9.0
"Our stay at Tyler's place was great. He made sure that his friend met us upon our arrival, showed us the parking and the apartment, even though we arrived quite late. 
The apartment itself is very nice, with lots of character and effort put into its renovation and decoration. It is located on a quiet street, but just steps from Rue St Catherine where all the shops and restaurants are. Having an assigned parking spot was amazing.
Overall, we would definitely stay at Tyler's place again if we need a place in Downtown Montreal in the future.",9.0
"This was our first time in Montréal and the apartment location, space, and value could not have been more perfect. The space itself is cozy, clean, minimal but with character, with a parking space nearby and a little back porch. It's in the middle of the action, near restaurants and centrally located to all the things we wanted to do in Montréal. The kitchen was well appointed. Tyler was very helpful and responsive. We will be back for sure!",9.0
"Spent a lovely few days in Montreal at Tyler's studio. The apartment was exactly as described. Clean and beautifully set up. The neighborhood was perfect for what we were looking for. Located minutes from all the shops and awesome restaurants. And quite close to all the sights; Port and Plateau were a short Uber ride away. All in all, the perfect weekend at a lovely studio. Thanks so much, Tyler!",9.0
"Tyler did a wonderful job of accommodating our late arrival time. He got us our keys quickly, and the apartment was in wonderful condition! It looked exactly like the photos. The building was in a very trendy area within walking distance of shops, bars, restaurants, and metro stations.",9.0
"We had a great stay at Tyler's apartment. The apartment is in great condition, exactly like the photos and a nice location! Supermarkets, restaurants, and the subway are nearby, and there is also private parking. Tyler was a great host. We would definitely recommend this apartment!",9.0
"The neighborhood was very close to everything. A wide variety of restaurants and shops were available. The metro was also a few blocks away. It was a nice central location for your stay in Montreal. Don't be fooled by the exterior of the building, as it is very nice and cozy inside. There is a lot of natural light due to the large windows.",9.0
"The apartment was wonderful and just as Tyler described; clean, spacious and only minutes from major metro lines. The neighborhood has many restaurants and is close to must-see sites including the Museum of Fine Arts. Tyler himself was communicative and helpful throughout the entire process. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Montreal.",9.0
"The host answered all of our questions without any problems. The apartment is easy to access, unfortunately for the cleanliness as the clean apartment could have been very good!",9.0
"Tyler was very helpful coordinating our arrival with a friend who met us to give us the key and show us to the parking lot. The parking lot is a little misrepresented in the current listing, as it is several blocks away and for 90% of our stay, it was occupied by an unauthorized vehicle. We asked Tyler about this, and he said he couldn't do anything to make them move. There was also an air mattress available, but no pump or linens to go with it so we couldn't use it. Overall, we enjoyed staying in this area (lots of great shops and restaurants, close to the Centre Bell if you're attending an event) and the apartment is beautiful, but we had constant headaches arising from the parking situation. I would have given a higher rating had the listing been more specific in this regard or had the situation been resolved more to our satisfaction.",9.0
"The apartment was as described, clean and perfectly located. Close to the subway and bus stops, plus rental bicycles are just outside the door. Walking distance to Crescent Street for lots of restaurants and the Fine Arts Museum. 

We stayed a week, and our small dog too. The studio is large, with nice light. Important to us, the bed is comfortable. Also, we appreciated the convenience of a washer and dryer. First floor is handy, just a half flight from the street. 

We hope to come back again.",9.0
"Listing was just as described. Parking spot was just around the corner. Location is excellent - easy walk to both the Green and Orange metro lines. 

Loved our stay at Tyler's place!",9.0
This is my worst Airbnb experience ever!,9.0
"Tyler's place is perfectly located for a visit to Montreal. Just off Rue St. Catherine and other major arteries of the city. Parking just around the corner was a short jaunt, nothing to complain about. 

Communication with the host and his associate Faizan was easy, swift, and helpful. 

Overall, a steal of a deal, good people, great location, nice place... I think it's a pretty solid choice. 

The bed was very comfortable, the bedding was also clean and comfy, linens were clean and plentiful. The AC worked great but we barely used it. 

A supermarket is around the corner.",9.0
"Tyler's downtown studio is a great getaway spot for the perfect weekend in Montreal. The studio was very clean and perfect upon check-in. It's located in a great location surrounded by shopping and food. The parking spot is a block away and it's a private spot, so there's no worry about finding street parking. Tyler was easy to communicate with and I would recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to Montreal.",9.0
"Typical apartment in the heart of the commercial street, ideal for discovering the city, doing some shopping or going to a restaurant. Free parking space is a big plus. Tyler was very available.",9.0
"The location of the apartment was great, as it was close to almost everything. 

I never met the host, but he arranged for his friend to be there to meet us. 

The place itself wasn't bad aside from some minor things like: the entrance of the building looked like it was under renovation but it wasn't.
The place wasn't ready to receive new guests; the towels were put in the dryer minutes before our arrivals. 

For the price, I expected the place to be better in comfort and readiness.",9.0
"Tyler is discreet. I haven't met him. I couldn't reach him by phone when I needed, but he promptly answered all my Airbnb messages. That worked for me and generally his messages are friendly. The apartment is really nice and comfortable. The kitchen table and seat are beautiful. It could be a little bit cleaner (some kitchen utensils needed washing) and more organized (the sink cabinet and closet were messy) but no big deal. The apartment is on the first floor of an old house and it seems to be under some renovation in the basement. So the entrance is all dusty and it may cause a not very good first impression. I hope they'll improve that soon, but overall it's a great place. Super close to metro stations, restaurants, and attractions. There's a nice backyard and a small porch, however, it's not clean and the stairs are broken. If Tyler gives some love to it, I believe it will be even nicer during summer (I was there in the beginning of fall). I would come back.",9.0
"Great location, everything is easily accessible. 
The interaction with the host was smooth.",9.0
"Perfect location and nicely equipped - ideal base for exploring the city. Extremely comfy bed!

The basement of the building is under renovation, so it is a little messy when you enter the building but obviously not the guys' fault. The bathroom is a little dated but again perfectly functional.

There are a couple of minor issues with heating and TV reception, both of which I suspect are due to the renovation work on the building. I am sure these will be resolved quickly and won't cause any future guests any problems at all - and I would certainly recommend this place to other travellers!",9.0
"It looks modern and it could be a terrific apartment. Unfortunately, it needs a lot of renovation, finishing touches, and cleanliness. Communication is slow and last-minute. 

You can't reach the porch or backyard. The full house is in renovation, apart from the apartment. Parking is in a tiny alley and not visible. It would be better to park your car in the paid parking lot across the street.

The apartment and surroundings could be nice for young people who want to party and crash, but anyone else should be able to find better places and neighborhoods. We saw a lot of fancy places and the public transportation system is excellent.",9.0
Very Friendly,9.0
"Very nice apartment as described in the listing. Also very well located, just two steps from a metro station and two steps from Rue Ste Catherine and Eaton Centre. Highly recommend!",9.0
"As for the location: 

- It matched the pictures exactly. It was nicely decorated and some books about Montreal were available.
- There were serious heating problems.
- The oven and TV were not working.

As for the neighborhood:

- It was central and located near shops, restaurants, bars, etc.
- It was quiet at night.

As for the host: 

We had a really disappointing experience. We told him in advance that our cell phones were not working in North America and had thus few ways to get in touch with him. 
We had arranged a time of arrival. We called him from a public phone to inform him that we would be a little late due to a problem with our car. He did not answer the call and did not react to the voicemail we left. When we arrived at the apartment, he was not there. He had left a lockbox but we didn't know the combination (he sent it to us by mail the morning of our arrival, knowing since weeks that we didn't have access to internet). We had to call him two more times in the next hour (it was raining outside) until he finally picked up (without apologizing) and told us the combination.
Later (we were staying for 5 days), we let him know that the oven and TV were not working, asking for more information, and he NEVER replied. We were thus unable to cook anything or watch TV at the apartment.

For all these reasons I wouldn't recommend this place.",9.0
"The apartment matched the description perfectly; it was incredibly spacious and had excellent amenities. The quality of the facilities was high, and the bed was very comfortable! However, the apartment was extremely cold, and the two heaters provided were insufficient for the size of the space. It was also quite difficult to get in touch with Tyler, which was not a positive experience.",9.0
"For the price, this apartment was great. For the traveler who values central location, decorative details, a host who is never actually around (we never met) but always a friendly text away, free parking and a comfy bed, Tyler's flat is well worth the money.

That being said, the apartment is so affordable for a reason- there were some corners cut. No central heating (had to use space heaters, which wasn't bad with the mild weather, but I can't imagine it being enough in the dead of a Montréal winter), no working oven or stovetop (one of the main reasons I airbnb instead of hotel) and a foyer and totally inaccessible backyard that are completely trashed and under construction. When I arrived, the building owner came by to do some work inside the apartment while I was unpacking and settling in. While he was only there for a few minutes, as a woman traveling alone it was a little awkward and unnerving.

None of these were dealbreakers for me- the apartment was cool, comfy and clean, and Tyler was attentive. I guess it depends on what you value.",9.0
"To start out with the positives, Tyler's place was exactly as it appears in the photos. The place is very nice. There is also a TV on a wall mount so you could watch TV from the bed. Erol is very kind and was very helpful with our problems. The location was also very good. It was nice to know we had a secure parking spot.

Unfortunately, we ran into a few difficulties while staying here. First, the parking spot was relocated to a parking lot about 5 minutes away, which isn't too bad, but it drizzled one night and we didn't have umbrellas. Second, the place was slightly chilly. It is heated by two heaters that you plug in. We left the heater on while we were away and when we returned it was a good temperature. This may be due to the renovations going on in the rest of the house. Third, we ran into some power issues where the outlets on one side of the house went out, as well as the wifi. We called Erol and he had the issue fixed by the time we returned. Again, may be due to the state of the building itself. Lastly, although the apartment was clean for the most part, the couch had a bit of cat/animal hair, which got into our clothes. 

Overall, our stay was not bad. Erol/Tyler are slow with responding to messages sometimes, but they were quick to respond when we called. Thanks for the stay!",9.0
"The location was good. Close to shopping, restaurants, and bars. It was also great having parking available, especially in the city.

Upon entering the apartment, there was a horrendous smell of wet dog which was apparently from the guests before us. Tyler's friend who dropped off the key was very friendly and accommodating to our delayed arrival and also brought us air fresheners to help mask the incredibly unpleasant lingering dog smell and was available for any questions or needs, which was nice. 

The unit overall is great for visitors wanting something basic in a buzzing location. There is no heating in the unit so we had to rely on the small portable heater, so just keep this in mind during cold winter times. The TV remote batteries didn't work and the lock on the front door was touchy. In terms of accuracy of photos, the unit had charm with the open brick walls but the decor had a rather interesting collaboration of rather dated pieces of furniture and modern additions as well.",9.0
Perfect size and perfect location for a quick getaway in the city! Walking distance to Bell Centre and not far from Old Montreal. We wish we could have stayed longer and would highly recommend it.,9.0
"Overall experience was great! The space was clean, and exactly as advertised. The host greeted us upon arrival and was incredibly hospitable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in the city and not pay a fortune for a hotel.",9.0
"The place is well decorated and clean. Loved the exposed brick and the hard-loft feel. The smart TV was very convenient and I generally enjoyed my stay here. My one complaint is that there is no central heating, and the room can be cold especially in the dead of winter. Tyler was very responsive throughout and I have no complaints on that front. I would think this place is much more suitable in warmer weather.",9.0
"Nice apartment and very well located! 
The host is nice and there is free parking included.",9.0
"The listing makes the apartment look great, but it doesn't reflect reality. The place is fairly clean but has some rough edges. It's heated by space heaters and the finishes are pretty non-existent. However, the location is excellent for exploring the city. It's a decent home base, but not ideal for a couple's getaway.",9.0
Second time we're giving up and it's a RAS. This housing is very well located,9.0

Nice kitchen, bed :) but the house was a little bit cold and there wasn't enough bathroom tissue.",9.0
"Very good apartment, well located, it has a very good value for money ratio. Tyler, our host, was responsive and available to address any issues that arose during the stay.",9.0
"Well-located apartment, highly recommended!",9.0
"Not like the pictures at all. The pictures do a nice job showing the decent parts of the apartment, but they leave out the crumbling entryway, broken closet doors, and refrigerator full of wilting lettuce. I was a little frustrated when we first arrived and then walked outside to find a man peeing on the stairs leading up to the door (at 3:30 in the afternoon). Would not recommend; you can stay in a hotel room for $30 more a night.",9.0

"We arrived in Montreal by car during the snowstorm. No one was there to greet us and directions were not very clear for finding parking, which was impossible due to the blizzard (a free spot, but not plowed). 

The apartment is very nice and well-located, with a metro station nearby and shops nearby. However, we had the bad surprise of finding the teapot with an used tea bag inside.",9.0
"Absolutely loved Tyler's place! His apartment is surrounded by great places to eat, easy access to shops and public transport. The place is super comfortable and homey! We had a slight problem getting into the parking space but Tyler responded to our questions really fast and it was sorted out immediately! We'd definitely stay again in the future.",9.0

"Tyler's place was a great little loft perfect for a couple. Conveniently located right on St Catherine, it has lots of stores and restaurants nearby. Parking is a bit inconvenient due to it being a bit of a walk and also in a confusing location. Other than that, it was clean and a great stay!",9.0
Tyler was an awesome host. He was very accommodating and went out of his way to ensure we were happy and satisfied with our stay; he was always available to answer any questions or address any concerns we had. We would definitely recommend staying here!,9.0

"This apartment is beautiful and located right in the heart of shops, restaurants, and public transportation. Even though it was in the middle of the city, we were able to find parking directly in front most times we needed to park. The apartment is beautiful, stylishly decorated, clean, and very comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay!",9.0
"Tyler was an excellent host! Due to unforeseen circumstances, we were informed shortly before check-in that the original listed apartment was temporarily uninhabitable. Tyler worked hard to find us comparable accommodations at one of his other properties. Although we weren't able to stay in the original apartment, Tyler ensured this did not affect our time in Montreal and we ended up really enjoying our stay.",9.0
"Despite Tyler's friend overstaying his welcome at this apartment, Tyler quickly got us a taxi to another apartment closer to the Place des Arts and cosier, so we had a perfect stay. He was really helpful and we settled in comfortably. The first place did look a bit like a building site as other reviews had said but that doesn't take away from it, it's a really cool and large space, would be a great place to stay - in a cool area with lots going on. Recommended: Upstairs Jazz bar close by. Thanks Tyler + Erol, have a great summer, we love Montreal!",9.0
The host cancelled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0

"Amazing location! Amazing host! Amazing apartment! Very central location with many things to do nearby, the metro was very close, making getting around the city seamless.",9.0
"The apartment is clean and located in a good spot close to the metro, shops, and restaurants. Instructions upon arrival were clear. The parking spot was easy to find and nearby despite being on a different street than the apartment. The entrance of the apartment has a higher step to be mindful of in order to not trip. Tyler was a good communicator keeping us updated regarding the city's plan to cut the water briefly on one of the days. Overall pleasant experience staying at Tyler's.",9.0
"Tyler and Errol responded efficiently and quickly to any of my questions. 
The studio was really nice and clean. Netflix was a bonus and the moveable TV ... cool!

However, I had a little difficulty with the doorknob of the apartment (round key) ... Also the door makes a creaking noise. And the bathroom door could not be closed properly.

Aside from those, my stay was great and I will come back if there is another opportunity!",9.0
"Tyler was very quick with his responses and very precise with check-in. He had no problems whatsoever, and I recommend this cute place to everyone.",9.0
"Tyler is an excellent host who responds quickly to messages and ensures the comfort of guests. The apartment is really well-located in downtown, at the foot of Mount Royal.  Convenience store, SAQ and grocery store are less than 3 minutes walk away. Having included parking is a big plus and it's located very close to the apartment and secure. The street is quiet (I slept very well!) but close to action if you want to go out for dinner or bars. Very comfortable bed and modern bathroom. The loft-style urban setting puts you in the mood. Private patio, well appreciated for apero. Functional kitchen, though the fridge is relatively noisy. Excellent wifi. Overall, an excellent stay with Tyler! I highly recommend it!: )",9.0
"Nice, clean place. Walkable, everything is nearby. Easy to reach by car. Parking was a big bonus.",9.0
"Great hosts who are friendly and easy to deal with, perfect location and a really nice apartment, would definitely stay here again.",9.0
"We had a great stay! The place was close to everything we wanted to see. Tyler responded quickly and we didn't feel like there was anything lacking in the place. Thanks, Tyler and Errol :)",9.0
"Conveniently located in the heart of Montreal. Studio apartment as pictured, with some nice aesthetic touches, a large shower, and a comfy bed. Surrounding the apartment, the building itself and the patio are under construction, but otherwise the apartment was as described and it was easy to get anywhere from this location by walking or via metro. Great place to stay!",9.0
"Absolutely loved this space! It's much more spacious than the photos show. The space is very stylish and comfortable, with great amenities. The location is also very great, being close to many good restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!",9.0
"Tyler's place was great. The central location makes getting around easy, and the bed is comfortable. Check-in was easy, and Tyler was quick to respond to any questions we had. 

The Wi-Fi was fast. The parking spot is about 300m from the front door and is a little tight, but we weren't planning on using the car while in the city, so it wasn't an issue.",9.0
Tyler provided clear instructions for check-in and parking. We loved the location of this studio apartment. Just off of Ste. Catherine's and a 20-minute walk to the Bell Centre. The apartment was very clean. My only complaint is that the back door should have blinds for extra privacy.,9.0
"This was the best experience I've ever had with an Airbnb. Tyler's place was beautiful, spacious, and in a great location. Close to everything but still really quiet. His apartment was also impeccably clean. Not a speck of dirt or dust to be seen! Tyler was also really easy to communicate with. I can't stress how much I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a home-away-from-home in Montreal!",9.0
"Great stay at Tyler's studio last weekend! The location is incredible—groceries, coffee, convenience stores, and the subway are all within 5 to 10 minutes of the apartment. The studio itself was a great home base for a weekend in Montreal, perfect for a couple. The row house itself, while being steps from bustling St. Catherine Street, was quiet and private, and had everything we needed. It's in an old stone house from the late 1800s—I admire the work being put into this unique space! Thank you so much!",9.0
"Tyler's place is wonderful! He was incredibly accommodating and fast responding. He's a heck of a host! Aside from Tyler himself, the place was beautiful and in a wonderful location so that you can get everywhere you want quickly. I'll definitely be back!",9.0
"Had to cancel my stay last minute due to a series of events, but Taylor was super nice about it and understanding. Communication was excellent and everything seemed like it would have been a great stay. Recommend to anyone",9.0
"Tyler was very communicative and helpful before and during our stay. The house was easy to find, very cozy, and so comfortable for us to stay in! I would definitely stay there again the next time I visit Montreal.",9.0
"I believe there are some improvements to communication that could be made. The place is very nice. It would be important to clarify that parking, which is easily accessible, is paid. Free parking is too complicated. The purpose of this comment is to make suggestions for improvement. Thank you, Jason, for taking over the heating. This point also needs improvement. We need to clearly inform people how to turn on the heating. I almost asked for a free night's stay because I was freezing cold.",9.0
"Great spot just a little ways down Ste. Catherine's. Very, very clean. The bed was super comfortable, pretty much had everything we would've needed. The location was good for shopping and if you're going to the Bell Centre, but sometimes we found ourselves driving to get to the really good restaurants. 

Only thing that might have marginally improved our stay was a new shower head – it was like a jet and you couldn't really move it so that it wasn't spraying you in the face. Not so great for a girl who doesn't get her hair wet every day! And maybe a set of wine glasses would be appreciated. 

Overall, highly recommend staying at Tyler's apartment. Thanks again!",9.0
"The flat itself is a nice space and is as pictured—spacious, nice design, spotlessly clean. Convenient location, very close to the Metro and downtown shopping, or if you are going to a hockey game or have meetings at Concordia or McGill. The free parking spot is a couple of blocks away, but is a great bonus. One caveat about the location: this end of downtown is still a little on the seedy side at night. Not unsafe, but not the most picturesque neighborhood: panhandlers, guys sleeping in doorways, etc. If you're used to this kind of thing and know what to expect, it's fine. 
However, the space is in an old house that doesn't look like it's been renovated elsewhere. The biggest issue, especially for a Canadian winter, is there doesn't seem to be any central heating. Steam radiators were not working. The only heat source in the apartment was from a wall-mounted fan/heat/ac unit that was too small for the square footage and did not heat the space adequately. Since there was no heat coming from the rest of the house (the stairway and vestibule are old and unheated), it was extremely cold. The bathroom was freezing. My husband likes a cooler room for sleeping but he said it was way too cold even for him. We checked out the second day and moved to a hotel. I have to say that Tyler was extremely apologetic, gave us no issues and refunded the second night immediately. Very courteously handled. He also said he would address the issue for the future—if you are planning on staying here during the colder months, I would check to see if the heat problem has been fixed.",9.0
"First time using Airbnb, and it was a great experience. 
Tyler was very helpful and clear with communication, there were no surprises, which is the last thing you want when traveling.
The place was clean, great location right downtown, easy to get to shops, food and transit. 
We only stayed a couple of nights, but he seemed to have all the amenities for a long stay as well. 
Would definitely go back! 
Thank you Tyler!",9.0
"Tyler has a very nice place in a great location. We were happy with the check-in process, the cleanliness, and with the general communication. However, the heater was not working in the apartment and this issue was never resolved by the hosts, so the apartment was freezing all weekend. The only consolation was that the bed was very warm.",9.0
"We stayed 2 nights and 3 days during late November.

Tyler & Erol were such great hosts! They are really open with communication. Checking in several times before check-in and even after. They give instructions to the T, and that is extremely helpful for someone visiting someplace new. They are extremely flexible and accommodating. Their place is super convenient to downtown area. For our stay we left our car parked and walked everywhere. There's wifi, and Netflix available in the apartment. The heat in the apartment doesn't really ventilate through the entire place, so it was definitely cold and I would suggest bringing extra hoodies and sweats for sleeping in during the colder months. They were nice enough to provide a portable space heater in the bathroom and we ended up moving it between the bathroom (showering & getting ready) and sleeping area (the rest of the day) a lot. This really helps warm up the sleeping area and made it more comfortable.

We had some issues with parking upon arrival (the building next door was doing construction and all the scaffolding was in the parking spot. They were super proactive and immediately took care of this issue that same day, renting us another spot at the same parking area. Thanks for that guys!

The block where the entrance of the building is, construction is going on and it blocks the entrance of the door. It's a little confusing, but everything is golden once you get into the apartment! I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area & will def recommend their place to everyone. For location, parking, and everything else, it's a great value!",9.0
"This place is nice and clean but guests should be prepared to walk into a building that is undergoing extensive renovations. The main floor is totally gutted, which was a bit creepy to walk into alone and at night. The flat itself is a great place to stay and hang out; there are some issues that need to be tended to like the shower head is broken and kinda useless and the back window has no curtain. Once these are dealt with, I would recommend this place; the location is great, only 25 minutes walking from the train station and super close to many great restaurants and shops. It's also quiet at night which was great.",9.0
"Right behind Rue St. Catherine (lots of restaurant and bar options) and a 5-minute walk to the metro station (Guy-Concordia), it is in a great section of downtown Montreal. We drove into the city, but we didn't need our car once we were situated. Beautiful renovated apartment and very clean! Highly recommend.",9.0
Tyler's place was very clean and accurate to the listing. I would definitely stay at his apartment again.,9.0
Great space! Tyler was really easy to communicate with and extremely helpful and accommodating. The apartment is a stones throw from amazing restaurants. Will definitely be back!,9.0
"We had an amazing stay at Tyler's place. The interiors look great. The way the space is widely used and decorated is amazing! Great value for the money. The parking spot is quite close and at no extra cost.

The fire alarm located right above the kitchen is quite annoying as it beeps every time we cook. I would not bother to cook with so many options for food nearby. Tyler's house was centrally located to all attractions. He was very quick with his response and a great host!",9.0
"Great studio! Very well located at the corner of Main Ste Catherine Street (full of shops and restaurants). 5 minutes from the subway station.

Regarding the studio, I really appreciated the self-check in and out. The studio is well equipped.

Finally, Tyler was very nice and responsive; I highly recommend his place.",9.0
"Though I didn't meet Tyler personally, he was very responsive and a pleasure to communicate with!  Stayed for 2 nights, check-in was a breeze and the apartment was very cozy. It looked exactly like the photos and is in a great and lively location!",9.0
Tyler's flat is located in a prime location! So many bars and the supermarket are literally 3 minutes away on foot! The home was super warm considering the temperatures dropped below -40 at night! He even had an extra plug-in heater just in case we got chilly. The home was very clean and easy to find! Thanks Tyler!,9.0
"The apartment looks exactly as it does online. Easy to find, easy to get in. Professionally cleaned between guests. Very responsive hosts through the app, though we never saw them in person. We were there during a record-breaking cold snap and the place was cozy and warm the whole time. Overall, we had the best time and would definitely stay there again. 

The only criticism is that the parking space shown in the picture is really two spaces. Make sure you park as close to the wall as possible so you don't steal the spot from your lovely neighbor. Secondly, I wish there had been a shovel and some salt in the apartment. It snowed an abnormal amount while we were there, so maybe not a regular issue, but we needed to dig out the parking spot a bit to get in, and the stairs leading into the building needed some love.",9.0
"We could not stay at this Airbnb. The building itself was under construction, with the entrance (not pictured) smelling of mold and dust, and construction materials lying around. The apartment smelled strongly of cleaning product upon our arrival. The street was also undergoing fairly intense repairs, which I expect would cause noise during the daytime.",9.0
"Tyler's flat is conveniently located downtown. Close to many restaurants and it's great that it comes with private parking, not on the street. It looks very modern inside and was nice and quiet.

I will definitely recommend this flat to others and will be coming back if I am ever in town. 

Thanks again.",9.0
Good location for a quick trip to Montreal. Will need to come back when the sun is warm and shining. Nice and inviting studio with good space to work and a kitchen to help make you feel at home.,9.0
"The apartment was exactly as listed, if not better than expected! It was in a great area with easy access to the metro and plenty of places to eat within a few blocks. Tyler was a great, communicative host and we'd love to stay again if we ever return to Montreal. It felt like home for a few nights. We had an amazing time!",9.0
"Tyler's place was everything it was advertised as! It was very comfy and had a great location, and Tyler was super responsive and accommodating to our needs. Our only complaint was construction going on right outside the apartment which was unexpected but they didn't make any noise on the weekend.",9.0

"Tyler was a very nice host, he made all instructions clear and was just an email away if we needed anything. The place looked like the pictures on the inside and there were no unpleasant surprises. For our purposes, there was nothing lacking, although there might not be enough cooking utensils to make much more than pasta.

The parking space is about a block and a half away and a bit tough to get into. We never needed my car once though because the subway station was just as close and brought us anywhere we wanted to go.",9.0
"Tyler was an amazing host, responding quickly to any questions while also checking in to make sure we had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. The apartment was exactly as described, very spacious and super clean. We couldn't have been happier with our stay.",9.0
Had an amazing stay at Tyler's place. It's a few minutes walk from downtown and plenty of restaurants to eat nearby. There was an issue with the WiFi (that was out of Tyler's control) but he handled the situation professionally and was clear in his communications. We definitely felt welcome and would highly recommend his apartment for your stay.,9.0
"I had a great stay at Tyler's place. It was extremely clean inside, had a fully stocked kitchen, a great bathroom, and it was in a part of town that had a metro a short walk away with plenty of cheap places (and expensive places too) to eat around it. While I was staying, construction was being done on the building, so there was some loud building noises going on under me during the day, but nothing to keep me up at night and most of the time I was walking around the city so it ended up not being a problem. Tyler's place itself is beautiful on the inside. The pictures are exactly what it looked like, and they gave us fresh towels and left shampoo/conditioner. The only issue I had was with the parking spot, it was incredibly close to a building and I had a hard time getting into it, as it was icy and another car had parked close. It took me and my bf around 20 mins to get into and out of the spot. We were able to work it out though, and it was nice to have parking in Montreal considering it is a packed city. Overall a great and very fun stay.",9.0

The temperature was chilly while we were there and the place was plenty warm the whole time! Tyler was super receptive to our needs and was a quick message away if we needed anything. We came in a car, so having access to a parking spot was great. The parking spot was a block or two away from the flat, but it was super easy to find and convenient to use. We had no complaints, only high praise for our experience staying at Tyler's place!",9.0
"Our stay couldn't have been more perfect! We were close to many of the places we wanted to visit in Montreal and steps away from a Metro that could take us all over the city. 

Tyler was one of the best communicators we've ever had on Airbnb and was beyond accommodating for us. The space was clean, convenient, and quiet. It really made planning our entire trip such a breeze. We were able to relax and watch Netflix late in the evening and in the morning we were able to cook with a fully equipped kitchen.

I highly recommend this place to anyone interested in visiting Montreal.",9.0

"Tyler's house is very close to downtown and easy to locate. The house itself is very stylish and cozy. Tyler had left us detailed instructions on getting in and finding our parking spot.

I would definitely recommend this house for anyone wanting to explore Montreal.",9.0
"The apartment is satisfactory. 
The instructions for entry are correct.
The building and the street were under construction.
Tyler was attentive even though we haven't met him. He was responsive to a small problem encountered and facilitated the guarding of our luggage.
Well-located for access to interesting places and public transportation.
I recommend it.",9.0
"Great little place near downtown. Easy access to all the good things Montreal offers, whether by bike or on foot.",9.0
"The best thing about Tyler's apartment is its location! It's right in the heart of the city and within walking distance of almost anything you'd want to see or visit, including close proximity to a metro station. Tyler was very communicative and warm in welcoming us to Montreal. The apartment itself is kind of a gem - the street had construction going on and when we walked up to the front of the building and even into the building's foyer we weren't sure what we had gotten into, but then we opened the apartment door and everything looked as shown in the photos. We recommend it for future travelers.",9.0
"If you're looking for a clean, affordable place to stay, Tyler's place is a very good option. The location is fantastic and close to great restaurants and the Metro station, and the TV had Netflix.

"Tyler was an excellent host, he was super responsive to our messages. The apartment outside is undergoing some renovations but since we stayed during a holiday weekend there were no works so it was nice and quiet. Inside the apartment is really stylish with a lovely modern living room and bathroom. We found the apartment to be really comfortable and in a great location. The free parking a few blocks away was also a huge bonus! Thanks for a great stay!",9.0
According to the description. Clean.,9.0
"Pros: I have some pretty strict cleanliness standards and I can say this place was nice and clean! It was a great space to stay as a couple and I loved the preservation of original architectural details like the crown molding and exposed brick. The shower was nice, the bed comfortable, and the TV with Netflix was great. It was conveniently located downtown and we easily used the metro to get around. The parking spot and AC were also great to have. It had nice amenities and great touches. I'd love to stay again! We felt right at home.",9.0
"Tyler's place is really great - looks a little sketchy from the street view but don't let that deter you. Inside it is really clean, stylishly furnished and has all the amenities needed for your stay. Check-in and check-out was really simple with Tyler's directions and the lockbox by the door. The parking space offered is a 5 minute walk away but not a problem to get to with Tyler's directions. The parking space is in very tight quarters and we were a little uncertain as to whether we were in the right spot at first but we were thankful for the option because there was nowhere else close that we could have parked our car. Tyler is a very accommodating host, giving great suggestions for things to do in Montreal while we were there as well as checking in to make sure we were doing well during our stay. He is quick to respond to messages and we appreciated his friendliness. His place is just off of busy Rue St. Catherine where there are lots of places to eat and shop. It is also close proximity to the art galleries, Mont Royal, a grocery store and pharmacy. If you want to head downtown to Old Montreal it is also pretty close (we opted to walk because it was a nice day and it took us about 40 minutes). Thanks for a great place to stay Tyler - we will definitely stay again if we get back to Montreal any time soon!",9.0

"We just loved our time in Montreal and Tyler's apartment was the perfect little home for us during our visit. It's truly in the center of downtown with easy access to everything we wanted to see. The apartment was beautiful and extremely clean. Tyler was really accommodating and willing to offer suggestions and tips for things to do while we were in town. There is quite a lot of construction going on across the street which could be a little jarring at times but it's really beyond the control of the host, just something to be aware of. Other than that, we loved our time in this gorgeous space!",9.0
"The truth is, I want to live in this studio. It is very cute and comfortable. Perfect for solo travel or a couple. Plus, it was incredibly clean, which I do appreciate. Tyler was really good at communicating and happy to answer any questions I had both before and during my stay.

"This studio is really really well located, comfortable and well equipped. I needed to spend a night away from home running around Montreal, and being on the cusp of downtown and the plateau made it easy for me to reach most places I needed to go on foot. Saint Laurent is right around the corner too. Tarek is a friendly and funny guy, and was easy to coordinate with (he actually checked me in personally at 11pm). Oh, and the bed has been replaced by a full one! Definitely would recommend this place to tourists who want a cosy space and central location.",10.0
"My husband and I had a great time staying at this studio during our daughters' graduation. The location is one block away from McGill Downtown campus. The host was very kind to help us find free parking right next to the house upon arrival. The facade of the house looks like a heritage site, very beautiful. The studio has all new facilities, the bathroom is large for a studio and fully renovated. The kitchen is nice, it also had some breakfast items. This place is great for a couple. The only downside is the mattress, not the most comfortable. Otherwise an A+ place and host. Would highly recommend.",10.0
"We absolutely loved staying at Tarek's charming place, which is exactly how he described it—a cozy ground floor studio condo perfectly situated. We were just steps from scenic McGill University, a short walk to the vibrant bars and restaurants on St-Laurent Street, and were conveniently able to walk to many other places during our stay. The exterior of the building is beautiful and historically looking while the interior is updated, comfortable, and super clean... all while being very peaceful and serene when we needed a break from sightseeing. 

Tarek was an excellent host—he was kind and communicative with us from the start and was flexible to some logistical issues we had. He even gave us ""must-see"" and ""must-eat"" tips and overall made us feel very welcome on our first visit to Montreal. We would definitely stay here again in the future. Highly recommend!",10.0
"We had a great experience staying at Tarek's apartment. It was very clean and spacious for a studio, and the location was fantastic. We hit quite a bit of unexpected traffic and were about an hour and a half late arriving, and he was extremely accommodating for us. He helped us find parking, and was available for questions throughout our stay. Check out was a bit cumbersome because of an unforeseen conflict, but Tarek was very accommodating to make it as easy as possible for us.",10.0
We had a really nice stay at Tarek's place. The room was very clean and cozy. The location was perfect too. It was close to McGill University and a short walk from Rue St Laurent. There was also a bus stop just around the corner. Tarek is an amazing host and very accommodating. I would highly recommend!,10.0
"My fiancé and I arrived on a Thursday afternoon. Tarek met us and welcomed us kindly. He showed us the apartment and even gave us some local restaurants and areas we should visit during our week-long stay. He was an excellent host. When I reached out with a couple of questions, he responded even though he was away on vacation. The apartment is perfect for a couple looking to spend quality time together. It's cozy, clean, and more than I expected for a studio apartment. I would return here without a doubt. Thank you, Tarek!",10.0
"I enjoyed my stay at this place. It is clean, tidy, and well-furnished. The host is very helpful and responsive. It is close to downtown and very quiet.",10.0
"Tarek was very helpful and flexible regarding our check-in and check-out. We arrived an hour later than we had expected (as our train was delayed) and he was very understanding. We were three adults staying for three nights, and although the place is set up for one or two adults, Tarek provided us with an inflatable mattress, and things worked out fine. The place is nice, fully renovated, and very well located in the heart of McGill Ghetto. It's very lively with all the students setting up for the school year. There are a lot of amenities close by and the location is quite central. Overall, a very nice stay.",10.0
"My girlfriend and I stayed at Tarek's place for a weekend trip to Montreal. Tarek was an extremely gracious, communicative, and accommodating host. His place is clean, cozy, and very comfortable (the bed is a dream). The apartment is in a superb location: convenient to public parking garages, close to more delicious restaurants and cafes and bars than I can count, only a 20-minute walk from the Museum of Fine Arts, and just a little longer to the Old Port and Notre-Dame Basilica. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!",10.0
"Everything about Tarek's place was great. Perfect location for exploring Montreal. He was informative about what to eat/visit/check out and I would absolutely recommend this place to others. A nice quiet apartment, very close to St/Laurent!",10.0

The apartment was very clean. Great location. Couldn't have been happier.",10.0
"My girlfriend and I stayed in this condo for a few nights on a holiday to Montreal, and it was exactly what we needed. The condo itself is fully self-contained and in a fantastic location to explore every corner of the city. Tarek was a great host, being very accommodating for late check-ins and early check-outs, while also recommending some delicious restaurants. The bathroom and kitchen were both very clean in good condition. I'd definitely recommend this condo to anyone, and we will definitely look to stay here again when we next come to Montreal!",10.0

Great spot. Small and cozy - perfect for one person. The host is friendly and welcoming. I had to leave early and she was very accommodating despite having arranged to only come back to the city after I had left.,9.0

"This is a ground-level apartment (actually a few steps up from the street) on Rue St. Urbain. It's very spacious and newly renovated. Beds are comfortable and brand-new. Contrary to the description, there is actually a full-size washer and dryer in the apartment.

Two bedrooms are near the street and can be noisy when the windows are open. The other two bedrooms are in the back and are quieter. You will hear the neighbors upstairs when they walk around, but this was not a problem at night.

The neighborhood is lively and has lots of restaurants. There is a supermarket 2 blocks away. Metro stops are a 10-15 minute walk. Parc Jeanne-Mance is a block away and great for an evening picnic.

Flatbook was very responsive via phone and email (though email sometimes took several hours to be answered).",10.0
"Great location. Clean. Comfy beds. On street level, so be ready to close and lock windows when not at home. One room right on a noisy street. Two are tucked away quietly in the back. Great kitchen, though bring everything you need for cooking. There are no knives for cutting other than basic perforated bread knives (i.e., no chef's knife or paring knife). The space feels somewhat cold (more like a staged house than a warm home).",10.0
"The host was very responsive and provided keys for all of us (4 guests). They installed AC during the first night that helped a lot with the hot Montreal summer. The apartment was very clean, and the furniture, bathroom, and kitchen were new. It was a great value, and it has a fantastic location opposite a church and a block away from a beautiful park.",10.0
"I visited Montreal and spent 3 nights here with my husband and his parents. The flat was as pictured, set up and perfectly decorated. It was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay. The kitchen had all of the utensils and dishes necessary to prepare meals if wanted. The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition. There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers. The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do. We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily. The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately ""at home."" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook. Upon check-in we had an issue with the lockbox. Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us. She was kind, personable and professional. We had a small issue with one of the beds that had not been properly assembled. We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with the front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would be polite. It was fixed before I saw it again. I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service. They truly deliver on their promise of 5-star 24-hour service. I would be thrilled to have future bookings accompanied by Flatbook service and can't wait to use them again!!!!",10.0

"Amazing place in a great part of town. Large, modern, and well laid out. Quick response, self-check-in was easy. It's a managed property, so not a personal touch, but professional and pleasant. Only complaint is that the place is a bit loud: you can hear walking (stomping?) from upstairs, and the front room lets in all the noise from the traffic. Otherwise super great!",10.0
"Amazing location and value in Plateau, great for groups. Due to the building's age, floors/walls are quite thin, so light sleepers should bring earplugs. The host was excellent and easy to communicate with.",10.0
"We had a great stay at this lovely apartment in Le Plateau! Very nice and spacious, very comfy couch and a great location. Communication went well and all necessary amenities were provided.

We were very happy with this apartment: it's very spacious and located in the heart of Le Plateau.,10.0
"Where were 4 guests, and pleasantly surprised that there were also four sets of keys available! The flat has a dishwasher and a laundry machine, detergents were supplied.

It's about a 30-minute walk to downtown (conference center), or a 10-minute bus ride (bus stop just outside the house). We didn't use the kitchen much, but there is a coffee maker, a big fridge, microwave and stove.",10.0

Host responded promptly and was very helpful. The parking suggestion worked perfectly, with someone arriving on holiday to open up when all other garages were closed. 

The place was clean and had all the amenities needed. Highly recommend this place.",10.0
"This was an amazing find. Centrally located, this apartment was perfect for our 6 person group's doors and drink tour of Montreal. Plenty of supplies and sparkling clean, would definitely stay here again. (Parking details were provided by the host and cost about $25 a day)",10.0

I had a great time. I felt like home.",8.0

"Yannick is a helpful host for local events, eateries, and getting around. The apartment is a classic third-floor walk-up in the ""Plateau,"" on the rise near Mount Royal. Great location. Easy access to metro subways, buses, and very walkable. Close to restaurants and shopping. He is on a one-way, quiet street. If you're driving, parking can be limited or unavailable, so scope the neighborhood and watch the signs! There's a Montreal parking app and Metro Transit app that are very helpful, and Yannick can help you strategize for a spot.",9.0

He went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. I felt safe and secure and was able to live according to my unusual schedule and hours without any problems!",9.0
"Nice, Nice, Nice. European and artistic but well organized and convenient house. Perfect location. A block away from a great street filled with international restaurants and grocery stores.

So have a nice time!!",9.0
"Shane was an excellent host. He is very accommodating, communicative, and fluent in both French and English. I never felt like I was intruding on his space and I felt at ease sharing his kitchen and bathroom.

"You can go without hesitation, it's as described in the presentation and the neighborhood is ideal for visiting Montreal. 

Of course, the apartment isn't very bright, but it's rare to be in the city center with an unobstructed view of the countryside! And then we're mostly there at night...",10.0
"The loft was immaculate! The decor was lovely too. It felt ""good"" - comfortable and safe the moment I walked in. I appreciated the security lock at the entrance to the building and the elevator.

"Great place, great location, and Andrew was very helpful and easy to communicate with.  It's steps from Notre Dame cathedral, and was a convenient place to be: in Old Montreal/Ville-Marie, but also right by the Place d'Armes metro station, Chinatown, and the bus to Mile End/Quartier des Spectacles. We found it very peaceful and relaxing, and great for an afternoon nap after a long walk!

The apartment was clean, quiet, open, and airy, there was free wifi and Netflix, and basic kitchen amenities, including a coffee maker. We enjoyed getting some bread, fruit, and veggies from Marché Jean-Talon and having them for breakfast. 

I would gladly stay here again, so I guess that's the best recommendation!",10.0

"Great little studio in the heart of Old Town - super convenient and steps from Notre-Dame Basilica. The apartment has everything you need and is impeccably clean.

Only slight downside for us was the communication style - not quite as welcoming and flexible as we've become accustomed to with AirBnB hosts. More of a serviced apartment experience rather than a true AirBnB but comfortable and positive overall none the less. Thank you!",10.0

It's within walking distance of everything and offers so many options for shopping, dining, patios, etc. The space is so cute and trendy, just as described. They offer so many amenities in the kitchenette and bathroom that you don't have to run out for the little things you might need. Very quiet inside the space. Check-in involved walking to a nearby location to get the key from a lockbox, but it was manageable. Thanks again!",10.0
"Nice apartment in a great location. However, this apartment is in a building that does not allow short-term rentals. We were not told beforehand. There is a warning on the front door that you do so at your own risk. Also, the owners were not very responsive to our concerns regarding the smoke alarm beeping regularly while we were there (it was never fixed for the full week we were there), and that there were no pillowcases for the extra pillows.",10.0
Perfect location for St Catherine's and the Plateau. The apartment was in a great location and felt very safe with a security door to the main entrance. My wife and I loved our stay. We would highly recommend this apartment.,10.0
"Olga and Andrei's place was very stylish, in a great neighborhood, and easily accessible. Contrary to what people are saying about the key location, it was very easy to find and a 3-minute walk from the condo.

Cons: There is a sign on the front door prohibiting short-term rentals (Airbnbs), the pillows were flat as a pancake (there were extras in the closet but no pillowcases to go with them), a dishcloth and/or a hand towel would have been appreciated. 

Pros: The place was super quiet, in a lovely area, the bed was comfy, and we very much enjoyed our stay.",10.0
The hosts were very kind and I had no complications. The apartment was also clean and didn't lack anything.,10.0
"The location of this apartment was so perfect. We loved being right in the heart of Old Montreal with easy access to so much. The apartment itself was also just what we wanted and needed—clean, cozy, quiet, modern and with most everything we needed. Keep in mind when booking that parking is not included and will run you about $20 a day. Andy made self check-in very straightforward. We gave it four instead of five stars because there were signs in the lobby saying that Airbnb was forbidden, and we worried about being kicked out. We never had a problem though. If they had been granted an exception, it would have been helpful to know that.",10.0
"Yves was an amazingly helpful, organized, and very welcoming host.

He was also extremely helpful, he provided recommendations for the best ways to get around the city, and informed us about free Bixi bike day. 

His condo was very clean, and he provided all of the accommodations we would ever need. 

He was also great at getting back to me right away - my messages were always answered within a few hours, and he answered all of my questions! 

I would highly recommend Yves' condo if you're planning to stay in this part of Montreal. It's a great location - it's so easy to get around the city with this condo as your home base!",10.0
"Highly recommend this listing for a perfect place to stay in Montreal. The place is even better in reality than the pictures if you can believe it. Stayed with two other friends for a long weekend and had plenty of space to feel comfortable - honestly it was hard to leave sometimes, the place was so beautiful. Convenient location to get around Montreal and great neighborhood.

Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Yves, but he was the perfect host regardless. We had everything we could possibly need but he was still very communicative and friendly about making ourselves at home in his place. 

Overall would definitely stay here again - and probably will since I visit Montreal often!",10.0
"I just returned from five nights in Yves' apartment, and I can't say enough great things about my experience. The space is spectacular: bright, beautifully decorated, modern yet comfortable, and spotless. The sunken living room is an awesome place to hang out, the bedrooms are spacious, the outdoor area is a great place to relax with a cup of coffee in the morning under the trees. The apartment is in a fantastic neighborhood that has a real French flavor. It's within walking distance to many of Montreal's attractions, and a short metro ride to others. And Yves himself is the consummate host. He was friendly and gracious, was very flexible with our schedule, and checked in on us several times to make sure that we had everything we needed. This is a true Airbnb winner and I can't wait to return!",10.0
"We had a five-star experience during our two nights at Yves' condo. The apartment is bright, beautiful, and spacious.

They're friendly and you'll never get bored when you have a conversation with them. They provide lots of suggestions and advice if you don't know where to go. The bedroom is nice and clean, and the backyard is awesome. We had a great supper time in their backyard with A&D, and we made BBQ! The apartment is located near the water and the park is beautiful. The area is quiet and the neighborhood is pretty nice. It's a 10-minute walk to the Metro (subway) and we didn't have any trouble traveling around downtown by taking the train. I can't wait to see them again next time!",10.0
The apartment is in a verdant and very peaceful neighborhood. The two bedrooms are large and the beds are comfortable. Alexia welcomed us and made us feel very at ease at her place. She was very accommodating with our arrival and departure times and even helped us find a place to print our tickets. I recommend!,10.0
"Alexia and Denis were very accommodating and easygoing hosts - I really could not have asked for better representatives of Montreal! We had gone into the city not really knowing what to do, and Denis sat with us for a good 15 minutes describing in detail some of his favorite places and the best times to go. Both Alexia and Denis were fluent in English and French, and we would engage in lively discussions on anything from politics to vegetarian recipes to Mario Kart (be warned: Alexia is prepared to defend her championship title on the last one!). On the flip side, they are also perfectly fine giving you space whenever you wish to rest or simply avoid social interaction.

As for the listing itself, parking was readily available on the street and the location was an easy 10-minute walk to the nearest subway station. The bathroom and bedrooms were clean, and the wifi connection was good. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood with no traffic noise, and there are no pets in case any guests might have allergies. I will definitely be recommending this listing to any friends or family visiting Montreal!",10.0

"Nice location. Good cafe nearby called St. Lo Bagels. Keep in mind check-in for the first day around 6pm. Stay the next day then out by 9am the next day. That's two days of accommodation which I thought was a bit inconvenient. Beds are fairly hard futon style. My travel buddy got very little sleep in the other room. The host is helpful with places of interest. Has recently installed a new shower. Woken up by noisy traffic both days as it's close to a busy road. Honest review. Nice hosts but probably look for something more comfortable next time. If you're looking for something on a budget, this would be a good option.",10.0

"Very pleasant stay at Alexia and Denis' place. The rooms are spacious and clean, as is the apartment which is also well-equipped.

Our hosts were available to give us advice even though we didn't see them much as they worked a lot.  As a result, we had the apartment mostly to ourselves.

The apartment is located 10-15 minutes from the Verdun metro station but there is a bus stop practically at the foot of the building for getting there.

The neighborhood is quiet and offers everything you need for dining or shopping.

Thank you again for your hospitality! We look forward to seeing you again!",10.0

Alexia and Denis were fantastic hosts. Excellent communication beforehand. They were incredibly helpful with lots of information. The house was spotless and tidy. Highly recommended and definitely worth staying there again.,10.0
"Alexia and Denis were very welcoming and accommodating, we had traveled a long way by car and were running late.  Only one small detail, the bed in which we slept was a bit hard for us, I would recommend to adults to sleep in the room with the Greek landscape view where, according to our son, the bed was comfortable. Children would adjust more easily to a harder bed. Otherwise, the apartment is very nice and well-located, very close to the river and pretty parks. We highly recommend these hosts.",10.0
"Our stay with Alexia and Denis was very good and we felt comfortable. Both are very friendly, open-minded and helpful. The apartment is about 10 minutes walk from the metro station, which takes you to the city center in 10-15 minutes. It's very quiet, you can easily park on the street in front of the house. We would definitely stay again!",10.0
"It was my 4th time being accommodated by Alexia and Denis (*2nd time visiting with my boyfriend). Amazing couple who you really want to get to know about and have a deep conversation with. They provided useful information about what’s going on in the city. Check-in and check-out are flexible. Their apartment is close to the Metro station and neighborhood is quiet. We had a fun, relaxing, and enjoyable long weekend. Looking forward to my visit again next time! Congratulations on your wedding~ Bon voyage ❤️",10.0
"Super stay at Denis and Alexia! Very welcoming and friendly, they know how to make you feel at ease and are available whenever we need help or advice. We felt a little like home. The apartment and bedrooms are spacious and very clean, there's everything you need for a good stay. The green metro is 10 minutes walk away (journey of about 10 minutes to the Montreal Metro Center), and Bixi stations are nearby the apartment. The Verdun neighborhood is very cute, and don't miss Wellington Street and swimming in the Saint Lawrence River nearby;).",10.0
"Denis was very nice. We found the place easily under Denis's instructions. During our stay, I enjoyed several free talks with Denis. It is surprising to find that he is an engineer and has the same background as us.",10.0
"Great hosts, fantastic communication. Only thing missing was AC or a fan so the room got very hot with no air flow when it was over 90 during the day. No fault of the host, but perhaps a fan would be good. Very friendly and kind hosts who helped when we had a flat tire and offered to help find a shop to fix it. Would recommend if you need a close place to everything and kind people to chat with!",10.0
My first time using Airbnb and also my first time in Montreal; Alexia and Denis made it a great experience. They have a very clean apartment and are close to the metro. The recommendations and map were appreciated! Thank you so much :),10.0

"Nice quiet neighborhood, parking available on street (better practice your parallel parking skills!), nice big rooms, clean and incredibly accommodating hosts. Me and two teammates stayed over a weekend and barely saw the hosts until the last day we were packing, but they were always a quick message away. Loved staying here.",10.0
"Our stay with Alexia and Denis was better than expected. We interacted most with Denis, who was super friendly and always ready to give any advice on what to visit and where to go (the breakfast advice was awesome).

Nice place!,9.0
"We can't say enough great things about this host. Any question or concern we had, he responded within minutes. The unit was clean and looked like the photos posted & all the details about the location were accurate. We would highly recommend this unit and host to anyone considering visiting downtown Montreal.",9.0
"This apartment was very nice and we really enjoyed our stay. It looks like the pictures and was very quiet, though nearby to restaurants and shopping in the downtown area as well as Mont Royal. The kitchen had all the standard amenities. They provided shampoo/soap/conditioner and towels as well. I would stay in this apartment again. There were only 2 of us but it is large enough to hold a couple more people (though only has 1 bathroom).

Two things to note: as stated in the description, the building is currently under construction. It was very loud for two days of the trip but we didn't hear it at all on the third day. Keep that in mind if you choose to book while the construction continues. Second, Sonder requires you to register on their website (with name, email address, and phone number) in order to rent an apartment from them.",9.0
"The highlight of this place is its location. Easy access to shops, the metro, restaurants, etc. The amenities are good. The kitchen, dining area, and living room have basic furniture that will work for most travelers. The beds are a little stiff but there are worse places to lay your head. The bedroom with the ball lamps on the side table is very bright while the other bedroom is wonderfully dark. Temperature control is challenging since the only AC unit is in the dining area. Water temp fluctuates without adjusting the nozzle/valve, but that's probably building-wide. During our stay there was construction on our balcony so we woke up each morning to those sounds. We were instructed not to open the windows to avoid dust coming in. On the morning of checkout the next client came in at 7 AM. That was awkward. In summary, it's a nice place but this wouldn't be my first choice for the next visit to MTL.",9.0
"Beautiful apartment, super clean, easy instructions. I really recommend this apartment!",9.0
"This is a great spot in downtown Montreal! Close to all the downtown attractions, including nightlife and restaurants, etc. Issues included being a little dusty when we got there, as well as being a bit too far from the closest supermarket. What you see is what you get. Communication between guests and hosts was fantastic. Another problem was that while we were there, one of the neighbors had construction, which resulted in a lot of noise early in the morning, which disrupted our sleep. Overall, we had a great stay.",9.0

"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay (3 nights) with Tessa and Trevor. Although we didn't get to see them too much, when we did they were both extremely friendly and always ready to help with directions or recommendations for places to eat at or stores to visit. Their apartment was clean and cute, and the neighborhood they live in is quiet and felt really safe to walk around late at night. Mile End is a great neighborhood - lots of interesting cafes, bakeries, two renowned bagel shops, vintage stores, bars, lots of bike rental stations and bike lanes. We would both definitely return in a heartbeat.",10.0
Tessa and Trevor were very friendly hosts. The bedroom was clean and comfortable. They would definitely stay there again!,10.0
"We enjoyed our stay!

The neighborhood is great, with a pretty and safe atmosphere;
The apartment is very pretty and clean, the living room and porch really make a difference;
The room is good, I wish it was quieter and the bed was bigger though (not in a bad way, Tessa told me ahead of time that it's a twin-size bed. It's perfect for one person, not two. It wasn't a big deal though; the room is next to a busy road so I could hear trucks and cars during sleep).

Overall, the room is really cool. This is my first time using Airbnb. I really loved it. It's way better than any hotel. I felt at home and Trevor helped us get to know the real local stuff. I will definitely book it again! Thanks again, Tessa & Trevor!",10.0
Tessa and Trevor were both really nice hosts. They were friendly and happy to help whenever I had questions. The place has so much character and is in a great spot! It's so close to everything and Mile End is such a cool area. I would recommend staying here while you're in Montreal.,10.0

"I had a nice stay at Tessa's place! Tessa and Trevor are kind people who gave good recommendations.

The location is great, with lots of awesome restaurants and music venues in the neighborhood. It's also quite close to the park and easy access to other parts of Montreal.

The room has a comfortable chair and desk that's great for when you want to get some work done at home. And there's a laundry room with washer and dryer, which proved to be convenient.

The only issue was that it was quite cold (especially at night), and we weren't able to get heating. Tessa did provide extra blankets, but sadly didn't do much to keep me warm. I'm sure they'll get the heating fixed (as Montreal can get super cold), so shouldn't be an issue for others.",10.0

"We stayed at Tessas and Trevors apartment for 6 nights. The room was comfortable and the apartment was beautiful, nicely decorated. She/he definitely has an eye for visual details!! We mostly used the room for sleeping and it was more than sufficient for us. The location was perfect; the bus stop is right next to the apartment and it was easy to travel around Montreal. There were also some nice restaurants and shops, and Tessa gave us a helpful list of things nearby. Tessa gave us 100% of her help if we had any questions.",10.0

They provided great recommendations on things to do in the Mile End area, which was left for us in the room so we could easily take it with us and explore the area.

Parking was a little annoying; there are a lot of restrictions, so if you have a car, make sure to read all the posted signs carefully! The area was super cute, Tessa's place was very centrally located and walkable to just about anywhere we wanted to go in Mile End.",10.0
"Excellent stay in the trendy Montreal-style neighborhood.  Bus stop for downtown just outside, direct route. Bike paths throughout the neighborhood. Many sports facilities too.

The room and apartment were also exactly as pictured, Tessa really has a great eye for decorating. If you love animals, I would also recommend this place because they have an adorable and super friendly cat named Navy. As for the neighborhood, the Mile End area is really cool− it has a bunch of great restaurants and bars. Transportation was very convenient, as well. There is a bus that leaves from the corner and the Rosemont metro station is also super convenient and easy to get to. I will definitely be recommending this place to all of my friends! :)",10.0

"It was a fantastic experience at Karen's house in Montreal. We felt right at home. Communication with Karen went very smoothly and effortlessly. She checked in before and during our stay via email to see if everything was okay and provided additional tips for our trip. Even beforehand, she asked what we would like to do and gave us suggestions on where to shop and go out, and prepared a list of how things worked and where everything could be found. The description of the house is absolutely realistic, and the surrounding area, Plateau Mont Royal, is the new trendy neighborhood for living and enjoying life in Montreal. We spent a very nice week there as a family with 4 adult children, walking a lot, buying croissants from the best baker in the city around the corner, and celebrating with the adult children at one of the most popular bars around the corner with Montreal friends. Although so centrally located, the house is absolutely quiet and no street noise can be heard. Upon arrival, there was beer and milk for coffee in the fridge and a bag of coffee for the espresso machine. We can only recommend Karen and her house wholeheartedly.",10.0
"Our group of 3 adults and 3 children (aged 8-15) stayed for 5 nights. With the eclectic decor and fully equipped kitchen, we felt like we were staying at our friends' home. Karine offered helpful suggestions for the neighborhood and was quick to respond with more information when asked.

The grocery store is right around the corner. Some of the city's best coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping are all within walking distance. The metro was also close enough that we had no problem making multiple trips to and from each day, as we opted not to have a car for our trip. 

The home worked great for our family. Two rooms with single beds accommodated my children perfectly, and the master bedroom was spacious. All bedrooms had fans which we put to good use as the home does not have AC and we were staying through a heat wave. The backyard oasis was perfect for winding down after our day's activities, and our daughter loved her private backyard balcony and hammock. The home also had plenty of other fun diversions for the kids to play with. We very much enjoyed our stay. 

Thank you, Karine and family!",10.0
"You will experience the true Airbnb life! Karine shares her family home, and it feels like you are warmly welcomed into her family! We especially enjoyed spending our evenings in the garden, and enjoying the temperatures that were hotter than usual this summer! The spaces are spacious and there is no feeling of being cramped.  The garden and house being very shaded, despite the heatwave, the temperature remained livable! The many fans available did their job! 
The kitchen is well-equipped for cooking for six people, and the dishwasher is greatly appreciated :)

"Sebastian started off strong. Throughout the booking and arrival phase, he communicated clearly and effectively. He was very helpful when we needed suggestions for parking. The unit was spotless and better than the photos. He even had a handy tour guide booklet printed out for guests. The location was prime for exploring downtown Montreal. It was just a 3-4 minute walk from the Metro.

Unfortunately, our visit was marred by a burglary. The back door appears to have been unlocked. We didn't use the door and were unaware of its existence until departing the residence. Sebastian is sure that it was left locked. We had left around 3 pm and returned around 3 am after attending Kanye West at the Bell Center and going out on the town. During the break-in, my personal laptop was stolen, and a closet door was destroyed. The police came and there was little they could do without the tracking software installed on my laptop. I believe Sebastian is a great host and has a great spot, but I was very unimpressed with his handling of the event. He had little to no concern about the loss of my possessions and even tried to charge us $400 for the damages to his closet. Airbnb customer service throughout this process was useless and made settling back home quite stressful. This experience has caused me to consider traditional lodging methods for future trips. Although, I think this was an unfortunate coincidence, it certainly dampened our trip.",10.0

"This was a great listing and an amazing place to stay. Sofia's place is clean, well decorated and just the right amount of space for 2-4 people. The space felt cozy and we loved it. We were only a bit disappointed that we found out at the last minute that there was no AC (as listed) but Sofia was very understanding and compensated us based on our experience. 

Sofia herself is a great host who is very attentive right from the first moment we wanted the place. She kept in touch by email and text and even checked in with us daily. The instructions she left were clear and she was available to help when we needed anything. The neighborhood was nice and quiet as well. 

I would definitely stay at this listing again!",10.0
"Sofia's place was exactly as advertised. It was really clean and her directions were very clear. Sofia kept in contact with us to make sure everything was ok.

Thanks again for everything, Sofia!",10.0

"My mom and I loved staying at Sofia's place during our trip to Montreal. Her place was clean, quiet, and well-equipped for a very comfortable stay. Parking behind the building was so convenient. My mom had to work from home for a couple of days, and the living room made a great home office as well. Definitely recommend for a peaceful retreat in Montreal that's still reasonably close to downtown.",10.0
"The accommodation on the top floor we liked very much. It was equipped with all amenities, including a variety of foodstuffs. Parking is available behind the house. The apartment is accessible via an staircase. For first and last access, the outdoor staircase must be used. The nearest metro station is 7-8 minutes away (round trip fare $6 per person).",10.0
"I had an amazing experience, Sofia's directions were very clear and precise. 

Thank you",10.0
"We had a great stay at Sofia's place! Photos are accurate. One private parking spot behind the apartment was very convenient. It's on the third floor with no elevator, which was not a problem for us. 

There is no air conditioning, but in the middle of June with the window cracked open and the fan on, it wasn't a real issue.

It's about a 10-minute walk to the subway, depending how fast you walk. We took the subway every day and got very used to the walk. There aren't many things to do in the area, but with the subway so close, it didn't really matter to us.

At first glance, the neighborhood appeared a little sketchy and run-down, but we never had an issue. It's a very quiet neighborhood with quiet residents who seem to keep to themselves. And the interior of the apartment is very welcoming and well furnished.

All in all, we had a great time and would stay again! Montreal is a beautiful, relaxed city and I recommend it!",10.0
"Sofia's place is worth every penny for its value. Although it's not located in the best neighborhood, this is the place that is close to downtown and offers easy access to anywhere.

I had a great stay at Sofia's. Didn't run into any issues.,10.0
It was my first time coming to Montreal and Sofia was a great host. She was very responsive and helpful. Her condo is really clean and there are plenty of street parking spots. She also has a parking spot in the back but I did not use it because it is easier to park in the street. One minor complaint that I had is that you can smell cigarette in the bathroom. It is probably from the neighbors smoking. I did let her know and hopefully this issue can be addressed in the future. We just left the bathroom vent on and it seemed to help. The location is decent and about 10-15 minutes from Downtown. Overall I had a great stay and would recommend it.,10.0

"Sofia's place is very nice, it is a lovely home and had everything we needed for our stay, everything looked like the pictures and everything listed was there. The location is not bad and only 20 minutes away from downtown Montreal without traffic, I didn’t find any restaurants within walking distance but there are many close by in a car. There are two cornerstones conveniently on each block near her place, which was nice. We just had to be careful because there are a lot of personal belongings belonging to the host in the home so we tried to be as respectful of her things. A lot of people touched the home. 

If you can't take the stairs, that would be the only issue other than that everything was great. I would recommend this for people needing a quiet place to stay not too far from everything.",10.0
"Sofia is a wonderful host who has put the time into ensuring visitors have clear instructions on how to get to her location, as well as clear check-in and check-out procedures. The home itself was very tidy and spacious, with a gorgeous kitchen and balcony. For those traveling with a vehicle, it is a great location -- within a quick drive to downtown, and she had a parking spot available. I would highly recommend this space for folks with access to a car or are comfortable using public transit to get around. Thanks, Sofia!",10.0

Special thanks for the late check out. Cheers :-)

Please note: You need to climb two stories (there is no elevator), so it's not ideal for the elderly or those with physical disabilities.

"We had a great stay at the Sonder flat. It was perfectly located for us in the center of nightlife, great food, and bars. As a large group of 6, the flat was a nice size and we slept very well at night. The only drawbacks for us were the lack of kitchen staples (most rental homes include ample sugar, salt, olive oil bottles, etc) and some issues with electricity (the only way to turn on bedroom lights was via turning on the living room light as well and there were lacking usable sockets in the bedrooms). Otherwise, we had a great time and would definitely return with larger groups again.",8.0
Awesome area to go out with lots of cool small restaurants,8.0

The best part of the apartment is its location.",8.0

"The hosts are very warm and communicative. The location is really great, very close to downtown, McGill, Old Port, and other POIs. The apartment was nice and modern with good amenities. The only problem is that the second bed is on a loft on top of the other bed, which means there is no privacy at all. It has a very short ceiling so it's only good for sleeping. And, the AC and ceiling fans do not reach the loft, so it was always hot.",9.0
"Large space, clean and tidy. Comfortable large sofa, supermarket and bars nearby.",9.0
"Ben was a wonderful and accommodating host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the loft. Everything was perfect for our two-night stay in Montreal. La Plateau is a vibrant and fun neighborhood and I can't imagine staying anywhere else in the city. The apartment is so comfortable and relaxing. I especially loved the oversized bathtub and waterfall shower. 

Ben was very easy to communicate with and was kind enough to check in with us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. He was able to provide great restaurant recommendations and beyond. Thank you, Ben! :)

We made great use of each and every amenity, including the rooftop patio, which provides a great view of the surrounding neighborhoods and skyline. The condo is located in the heart of the action and finding something to do was never an issue.

Ben ensured that we knew of all the best places to eat and which events to attend for the true Montreal experience.",9.0
"What you see is what you get! The place looked exactly as it did in the pics. Very clean, modern, fully stocked with everything you need and more right down to board games, books and movies.

He had the place ready on time and took us on a walk through to make sure we were good instead of just handing us the keys and splitting. This was my first Airbnb experience and after this one I will be using Airbnb again for sure.

Thanks Ben and Airbnb!!",9.0
"Bens place was very spacious and modern, with all the amenities we could want. Both Ben and his wife were super lovely and accommodated us with an early check-in at the last minute and had great communication. Ben and his wife even greeted us with fresh bagels and schmear from the famous Fairmont bagel shop and croissants. Their communication was great, and the place was a great deal for the area. It is super close to a lot of bars, restaurants, and shops and walkable to the metro which was about 10 minutes away and close to many buses. Even though it was a hip and somewhat loud area on the weekend, being off one of the side streets was very nice and quiet for a good night's rest. One thing to note is that you will need to use the set of keys to lock the door so going in and out requires the keys. It took some coordination but in the end it worked out. His entertainment setup is also amazing for when you want to curl up and watch one of their diverse library of DVDs with surround sound. All in all, I would stay again and Ben was a good host for our first time in Montreal.",9.0
"Ben was incredibly helpful throughout our entire stay. We met to pick up the keys, and then he was available via text for the duration of our visit.

He did everything he possibly could to help us retrieve it.  We truly appreciate him going the extra mile.",9.0

"Lovely condo that looks true to the photos and is in excellent condition. The kitchen was well-appointed with the basic things we needed. Beds are a bit noisy and bedding is nice to look at but cheap quality so not very comfortable. Note that it is a great, central location though it's on a somewhat seedier block of Ste. Catherine so you will see homeless people hanging around the church across the street from the condo often. We didn't have any issues though. Also, the smoke detector was off the wall and not working when we arrived, but I received a prompt reply via email from Sonder with an offer to fix it ASAP. Overall, a good place to stay in downtown Montreal.",9.0

The apartment also had everything we needed for our stay, and we were able to eat some evenings at home when we didn't have the energy to go out. One of the beds squeaked quite a bit, so if you are a light sleeper it could be a bit hard. I would recommend staying at the apartment.",9.0

Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, bars and locally owned boutiques within walking distance. Perfect!",9.0
"Centrally located apartment in a really nice, lively area of Montreal. Very welcoming host. Isabelle was SO thoughtful. She offered a disposable kitty litter and catnip for my cat, who quite enjoyed the stay too!

The room (and apartment) was SUPER clean and came with everything from a bathrobe to shampoos and soaps to even - and this one impressed me a lot - a PRAYER MAT. For people who need one to pray! I had NEVER seen anywhere think of providing so simple and obvious an amenity before, not even expensive hotels. It shows a level of empathy that she continued to demonstrate during the whole 10 days I stayed with her.

She's a good conversationalist and also very capable of resolving conflict calmly, which is good since there are bound to be toes stepped on when two strangers decide to live together for several days.

All in all, despite some minor awkwardness, I'd say that I had a nice stay and would recommend Isabelle's company and hospitality to anyone wanting to find low-price high-class accommodations in Montreal for a brief time.",10.0
"The host: Isabelle is a fantastic host. She is direct, easygoing, and fun with a great sense of humor (to the extent that she understands and appreciates mine. lol).

The place: The room has all the basic amenities you could dream of with a great balcony to enjoy if the host agreed to share it with you. Although small, this is a known fact, it's perfect for the solo traveler. 

The neighborhood: I've lived in Montreal for quite a while now and am still puzzled by Mile End. I call it ""the little Paris"" because of the amount of French people living there, but not only. The place is charming, and the small cafes and pizzerias definitely give you a taste of Europe.",10.0
"Isabelle welcomed me, and I felt like she had been my good friend for a long time by the time I left! Isabelle went out of her way to find a parking spot, made sure my stay was lovely and comfortable. She is a fabulous chef, and a wonderful company.  I truly enjoyed my stay.",10.0
"Bad weather forced me to advance my arrival and Isabelle was available to receive me a little earlier than planned. A neighbor was making noise and she went to ask him to lower the volume. In short, she managed to make my stay comfortable and I thank her for it.",10.0
"Great place, great hostess, great value.",10.0

"The apartment was lovely and in a fantastic location in Montreal. 

Just as described. 

Kenny was welcoming and helpful. He made our stay very pleasant and accommodated our arrival and departure times.",9.0
"We had the most wonderful experience at Kenny's spot! It's in an awesome location, central in the Plateau, and a quick 10-15 minute drive or cab into downtown.

It is cute, clean, and he leaves you towels and other nice additions that really make you feel comfortable! 

The property is set up through an entry code so no key exchange makes everything so seamless and efficient.

We will definitely come back to stay here again!",9.0
"Although we didn't meet our host in person, he communicated with us via text and promptly replied to any of our exchanges. We arrived in the evening and the lights and air conditioning were on for our comfort. Fresh flowers were on the table and the apartment was clean and stocked with all necessary supplies. The apartment was spacious enough for our family of six. Great location, close to shops, clubs, and restaurants. We would definitely come again.",9.0
"The apartment is very well located, on the Mount Royal plateau, close to restaurants and shops.

Kenny was very attentive and did everything he could to make our stay pleasant.

The apartment is just like in the photos, with 3 beautiful bedrooms and a terrace.

We highly recommend it.",9.0
"Very nice place with three proper bedrooms and a sofa, kitchen and living room. There were four of us and we were perfectly comfortable. In a great central location, easy walk or short drive from many Montreal destinations. Kenny was very accessible. Thank you!",9.0
"It's my first time using Airbnb, overall it's a nice house!",9.0
"Kenny's Airbnb was very spacious and unique. Everything was clean and the location (Plateau) was really good. Close to many bars and restaurants without the noise and crowds of the downtown core of Montreal (which can be reached by foot in 20-30 minutes or easily via subway).

Check-in/check-out was convenient using a key code. The apartment had a dishwasher, AC unit, washer, and dryer. There's also a TV box with Netflix, a nice added touch.

Free parking provided at the back of the house was very helpful. Finding parking in Montreal can be a huge headache.

I would definitely stay here again!",9.0
"Cute place that sleeps 3 singles comfortably (though we were only two). Loved the quirky decor. There was coffee, sugar cubes, and a French press which was nice. No hairdryer though, so ladies - bring your own. :)",9.0
"Very well organized
However, it is a bit noisy",9.0
Very large space. The photos did not capture its full extent. It has everything you need. Excellent location. Parking space is a little awkward.,9.0
"Our experience with Kenny was wonderful. Kenny was very quick to respond and helped us find an extra parking space for our U-Haul trailer which we had with us as we were moving our son into his apartment for the school year.  

The location is perfect, the apartment is large and I especially enjoyed sipping my coffee on the back balcony! Also, the free parking was fantastic for a small/regular sized vehicle. Parking may be too tight for a large SUV. The keyless entry was convenient, and the AC was welcome as it happened to be a hot and muggy couple of days.  Finally, we asked what we should do upon leaving and Kenny quickly wrote back ""don't do a thing"" and ""good luck"" to our son. It was a nice, personal touch.",9.0
"It was great staying at the heart of Rue St Denis, just 2 blocks from the Metro. Having a parking space is an added bonus. Air conditioning was great. Kenny was so thoughtful; she left bottles of water for us, which was a nice treat during the hot streak. The terrace was a nice treat. This place is awesome for a family.",9.0
"This property has a great location and unlike most in the area, it offers a private (albeit small) parking spot in the rear alley. 

It features two terraces, one overlooking busy St Denis, the other overlooking the backyard. 

The parking spot is a bit difficult to get in and out of. My full-size car fit, but I needed my travel partner to guide me when leaving the spot. 

Coffee and bottled water were readily available and a nice touch. 

The Metro station is very close by. 

I think it would be tight fitting six people comfortably. One bed is quite small; five would be more accurate. 

The free WiFi was fast and reliable. 

The host was very responsive with emails, arranging how to access the apartment.",9.0
"Great place to stay! Very clean and conveniently located near all the bars and restaurants and a metro station. It was very quiet, so you don't hear anything from the outside. I would definitely stay again and recommend it to future Montreal travelers!",9.0
"We had a great experience for our first time at an Airbnb. We really enjoyed our stay, and the location was wonderful. The rooms were clean, and the place had a cozy feel to it. We would definitely repeat.",9.0
Terrific place in Montreal. Great location. Clean and comfortable.,9.0
"Kenny's apartment is a great place to stay in Montreal. Like others have said, it's located in the heart of a great neighborhood, Plateau Mont Royal, and right around the corner from a metro station. There are multiple great bars and restaurants (including a bistro called Cafe Cherrier and the famous L'Express) within just a few minutes' walk.

We were a group of four and the apartment fit us very comfortably. The rooms are spaced pretty far apart for privacy, which was an added bonus. The bathroom is large and the water pressure in the shower was excellent (it's a pet peeve of mine when pressure is low!).

Kenny was extremely responsive—he answered a bunch of my emails before the trip and a couple I had while we were staying at the apartment, most of them nearly immediately. 

I would definitely stay here again!",9.0
Great,9.0
"Kenny's Place was very clean, as we expected and she even allowed us to return the next day when we forgot our trays. We would definitely stay here again.",9.0
"The apartment was adequately sized. The location was excellent, a three-minute walk to the metro station and a bus stop right outside the front door. The street scene was quiet as was the apartment itself.",9.0
"The place is located in a great neighborhood, right on the Plateau and not far from the trendy Mile End neighborhood. There are many nearby places to eat or go out. The apartment itself is very nice, comfortable, and quite spacious.",9.0
Kenny is an excellent host with great communication and accommodation. The apartment is located in a trendy neighborhood and is very comfortable for 6-8 people.,9.0
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Mona Lisa Apartment was just like the pictures and very charming! The Da Vinci theme was not lost on us... I loved the ""last supper"" on exposed brick.  Rooms were clean, bright and as pictured. Our host communicated beautifully and we were happy to find our accommodation in a new city with surprisingly little stress!
Private parking, laundry, two lovely decks, near bistros, across street from lovely cafe with the best croissants and coffee, metro very close, 1.9 mile easy walk to Old Montreal, park nearby, ... We loved it! We will be back.",9.0
"The entry/exit organization is very well done. We were not very present in the accommodation (kitchen not used), due to our discovery of Montreal!  
The accommodation is well described in the listing. Construction all along. Well located to discover Montreal... a friendly café located right across the street. 
A slight drawback on the bathroom cleaning, particularly the bathtub... but it can be fixed. 
Good value for money. No visual contact with Kenny, communication by email... Access code for the accommodation. Thank you for allowing us to leave our luggage after 12 pm since we had an evening flight.",9.0
"The living space is cozy with ample room for 5-6 people, a great location in a charming neighborhood, parking spaces and a small balcony.",9.0
"We had a lovely time here. The apartment was huge, super spacious with two balconies and everything we needed for a home base in Montreal. Kenny was super fast on our inquiries, and parking/checking in were a breeze. The location is great, with lots of awesome restaurants around, and the park not too far away. We highly recommend it. Thank you Kenny for the great stay!",9.0
"The Mona Lisa is a fabulous place to stay in Montreal. It's location is smack in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants. It's a quick walk to wherever you want to go and the metro. Inside there is lots of space to stretch out. We were three people and never felt crowded. The bathroom is nice and the shower had plenty of hot water. Overall, a good choice for a weekend in the city.",9.0
We had a great weekend at Mona Lisa! It was the perfect location for exploring the neighborhood and the entire city. It was convenient for transportation and even had a parking spot. I would definitely recommend staying there.,9.0
"With a very late arrival, Kenny was very understanding and so we were able to enter the accommodation without any difficulty. The apartment is in accordance with the photos, spacious and very well equipped. Close to the metro, and very well located, it's ideal for people wanting to visit the city. Thank you very much Kenny, we really enjoyed our stay in Montreal.",9.0
The apartment was great! We loved the location and Kenny answered all my questions very quickly. The space was clean and lots of space for us. It was great having the items needed to make coffee and a quick breakfast before heading out for the day. I would highly recommend this listing.,9.0
"Kenny's place is amazing :) It is right next to plenty of great food, bars, and shopping. It's very cozy and easy to access with parking in the back and the metro down the street. Thank you Kenny!",9.0
"Basic apartment on the second floor of an old, Second Empire residential building. Front and rear porches. Three nice bedrooms plus a sleep-able sofa and a spare queen mattress. 

This place can easily accommodate eight with good privacy.

Shops all around for basics and beer plus some lovely cheese shops and bakeries.

Great location.

Two parking spaces in the back.",9.0
Liked everything about the place. It was very warm and very close to amazing places.,9.0
"Nice flat ideally located in the heart of ""Le Plateau,"" a 2-minute walk from Mont Royal Street and the tube station. Convenient for parking a car. Kenny was very nice and helpful!",9.0
"The place was great to stay at! Kenny is very accommodating and the space was great. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The neighborhood was cute and there was a lot to see on foot, we didn't even need to use our car.",9.0
"Kenny's place was perfectly situated, just a 3-minute walk from the metro and right across the road from a cute coffee shop (with lots more great restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance). Kenny was very quick to respond to questions and provided info clearly. We liked that the apartment had Netflix already set up, and the kitchen was well-stocked with utensils if you want to save some money and cook for yourself. Bring your own food staples though, (salt, sugar, butter, etc) as there was no food in the apartment. Parking spot was easy to find, and we enjoyed the general feel of the place (brick walls, a good amount of light, big stack of clean towels). Our only real complaints were first, that the apartment is listed as 1.5 bathrooms, but there was only 1. As there were 4 of us, this wouldn't have been a deal breaker but we would have liked to know what to expect ahead of time. And second, the bed in the back bedroom was not very comfortable (the front bedroom was fine, and no one slept in the middle bedroom so I can't speak for its comfort level). All in all, I would recommend Kenny's apartment; I do wish we'd come during the spring or summer months to enjoy the two private balconies and backyard!",9.0
The geographical location is ideal. The beds are very comfortable.,9.0
"Fantastic location with lots of nice restaurants and shops, all within walking distance.  Warm and cozy feeling, and a family of six comfortably fit, I would definitely stay there again.

"The apartment is very well-located but of low quality, with average equipment. There are no amenities for short stays (e.g., salt, oil, basic foodstuffs...). 

It does not justify the advertised price.",9.0
Very well located apartment. Nice 3 bedrooms and large living space. Check-in and check-out are very easy! This is my second time at Kenny's place and it's great!,9.0

"Montreal Mona Lisa was everything that was promised: well located, clean, comfortable, and with parking at the back. Check-in was super easy and Kenny was an attentive host, getting back to us quickly with any questions we had. We'd be happy to stay there again.",9.0
"Clean, nice and cozy in a great location!",9.0
"We were three colleagues and the apartment was perfectly suited for that. Three individual bedrooms with a shared bathroom. The location on Saint Denis Street is excellently situated, close to shops and restaurants and the Laurier and Mont-Royal metro stations.

Attention if you are coming from France, there are no adapter plugs, so you will need to bring your own but there are stores like La Source on Mont-Royal street and likely many others. 

For cooking, there is a small amount of dishes but for us who only used them very simply it was enough.
The bedrooms are spacious with good bedding. We don't physically meet Kenny but she is very responsive and answers all our questions during the stay. A little problem with the entrance door and her father is there in 5 minutes. He is very nice and accommodating.

In short, a very good stay with a good value for money.",9.0
"The apartment is very good! I was there with my family (4 people in total) and we had a very good time. Close to cafes and restaurants, Mount Royal Park and Little Italy, the flat is also close to public transport and underground stations. Communication with Kenny was precise and super easy.  I would like to repeat the experience in Montreal and I suggest this flat to everyone!",9.0
"Kenny was a great host. The apartment was very clean, as expected. We had an issue with parking where a guest staying in the other unit occupied two parking spots, which forced our car to get very close to the neighbor's spot. I sent an email to Kenny and she contacted the other guest and resolved the parking situation very quickly.",9.0
The host cancelled this reservation 116 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0
"Kenny's place was such a great decision! It's right in the heart of Montreal. The rooms were kept clean and tidy, and the apartment as a whole was so quaint! It was perfect for 6 people. The parking space was helpful for anyone driving up, no need to find street parking. Kenny was very quick to respond to any questions I had! Definitely would recommend.",9.0
"Great location, with a parking spot right smack in the middle of all the action. Many good choices for food, coffee, cocktails, and enjoyment within a 5-minute walk. The check-in process was super easy and Kenny was very quick to get back to me about any questions.",9.0
"Convenient location and ample space, everything worked out well.",9.0
"There are a number of good things about this apartment: it's in a great location, it has three bedrooms with good-sized beds, the use of a private parking space is very helpful, and the wifi and hot water worked fine.

However, I expected something more upscale given the cost. We had water dripping inside the window when it rained at night, entry systems that stopped working (and some confusion over who to contact about that), light switches in odd places, one loud air conditioning unit for the whole apartment - a number of glitches. 

The apartment definitely worked for us during our four-night stay. But there were a number of issues along the way.",9.0
"This was a great option for a decently sized group of people looking to explore Montreal on a budget; there's plenty of good enough bedding (it seems like there's at least one extra spare air mattress and couch space, if your party is more than 6 people). The location is stellar (walkable to many areas of interest, with good restaurants), and the check-in process is hassle free.",9.0
"Overall, Kenny's is a great place. The only suggestion I have would be for the tub, as it could use a slight improvement.",9.0
"A lovely place in a great location. I especially appreciated the small balconies in front and back, where we enjoyed our morning coffee and our evening glasses of wine. Only issue was with the sheer curtains. You had better be prepared to get up when the sun does!",9.0
Average stay. Nothing outstanding.,9.0
"Great location and nice light inside the house thanks to two skylights. It's fairly quiet inside though the front bedroom gets some traffic noise from the street -- but nothing that would interfere with sleep as long as you're used to living in a city. 

One thing to note is that the apartment is on the third floor and the rear staircase is somewhat precarious. You might want to get a street parking spot in front of the house first to unlock the door and unload large items, then move the car to the dedicated parking spot in the back. Otherwise it takes a minute or two to walk around the block from the back to the front or vice-versa.

A minor annoyance is that all the drains have fine mesh filters on them that get stuck very quickly. We ended up having to clean out the bathroom filter pretty much every night.

Contrary to the description, the apartment does have a hair dryer, but did not have shampoo when we visited. There's a drugstore across from the metro station if you need to pick anything up.",9.0
"Nice apartment in a fantastic location. Plenty to see and do nearby, and a great space for groups to stay. We'd definitely stay here again.",9.0
"The place is adequate. Very well located. Very comfortable, it's a 3-bedroom apartment! Full kitchen. Kenny was very kind. I recommend this place.",9.0
"Awesome place, parking spot in the back and close to downtown.",9.0
"Great location, great apartment with lots of room, Kenny was very helpful. Would definitely book again.",9.0
The space was awesome for our needs - really spacious with three bedrooms and an additional mattress. Very close to Mont Royal metro station. Exceptionally fast response to all communication - and very clear instructions. Only complaint is the air conditioning unit is just not sufficient for the space on a super hot day. First night was exceptionally uncomfortable - slowly got better as the nights after were much cooler. Really enjoyed everything else though and would recommend.,9.0
"Very well situated near the Mont Royal tube station, with lots of restaurants and nice shops around. The street-facing room gets very noisy because of traffic, but the other two are nice and quiet. The flat is well equipped and friendly. Kenny responded promptly and well to all our requests. I'd go there again.",9.0
Well-placed and perfect for a family with three children.,9.0
"Location, location, location!  Walking distance to bars, cafes, and restaurants. We wish there was a coffee machine, but it's never been an issue with a great cafe just across the street!",9.0
We had a very nice stay at Kenny's apartment. He was very responsive via email and was able to accommodate a slightly earlier check-in for one of our guests. The apartment was in a nice location and well suited for a group of 3. We would return to Kenny's apartment.,9.0
The host cancelled this reservation 45 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0
"The accommodation is very well-located with 3 nice bedrooms. Contrary to what is written in the description, there is no TV. You need to call to get the wifi code.

The accommodation deserves to be maintained by the host, particularly for the cleaning area...attention there's nothing to cook, no pots, no bowls, not even a cutting board.",9.0
"I have no doubt this was once a beauty (whenever the pictures were taken). However, the host admitted that the space had been rented to a long-term tenant and the evidence was everywhere...from cigarette butts left both inside and outside as well as drug paraphernalia left behind. The floor obviously hadn't been mopped in quite some time and it smelled of smoke. There was no TV (although it was listed on the listing) and the smoke detector was not working and was not addressed when pointed out. Old linens were left behind but removed when requested due to smell. As well, the dishwasher was plugged into an extension cord, which was plugged into the wall and would trip the breaker when turned on at the same time as the AC. On a positive note, the location is great, the AC worked, and the beds were comfortable.",9.0
"The Mona Lisa apartment is located in a wonderful neighborhood with parks and the beautiful Mount Royal on one side, and the vibrant Mile End district on the other. It's close to the subway and therefore a good choice for every explorer. The interior of the home is pretty as well, although it would benefit from some renovations in certain areas. The host is incredibly responsive and helpful, so that was never much of an issue. Overall, I recommend it for families.",9.0
"Well-located, clean and well-maintained housing.

"Montreal Monalisa is located in an ideal location. Very close to the metro and restaurants. The outdoor terrace near the kitchen is a lovely place to have breakfast. We found the unit clean. 

Some observations. We saw 2 smoke alarms in the hanging basket. Not quite sure why they were there, but any future guest should ask about this. There was no toaster. Not quite sure if this was an oversight or are there electrical issues. They did have a portable air conditioner which provided enough cooling for the main area, but the bedrooms were warm. One of the fans did not work and another did not function as well as it should. There was not a third one.  An unusually warm time in Montreal, there needs to be better air flow in the bedrooms, which means three well functioning fans. Light switches were hard to find and some of the lights did not work. 

The main complaint is that they listed as an amenity, a parking space. This is not true. Fortunately, the manager was there when we arrived and very graciously got in my car and helped us find a public parking space that was good until we left. Public parking is very difficult in this neighborhood, so be aware that this could be a problem.",9.0
"The apartment is well-located, just next to a metro station. However, if you are counting on parking, be aware that it is an error and parking your car is very complicated in Montreal.",9.0
"Great location for those who love the neighborhood like us...

Beautiful house view from the street. 
Nice brick walls on the interior side...
For the rest, quite average. It would deserve to be ""repainted"" and a good sweep.",9.0
"Spacious apartment, very well located (with a free parking space). Some outdated equipment (or that doesn't work). Please note, it is not suitable for an infant (steep and unsafe staircase).",9.0

"Very nice apartment, very well located. We lived there with four people, our stay was very pleasant! I recommend it! 

The apartment is very warm and very well equipped",9.0
"Apartment well-located with 3 bedrooms, therefore practical for groups or large families. The best thing is having two small balconies to enjoy the Montreal sunshine.

The downside is the bathroom, we had big problems with the bathtub and it's quite tricky considering there were 5 of us using it. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay here!",9.0
"No dedicated parking space (which is why I gave a 3-star rating). This was a big issue for us since we had a rental. Parking in Montreal is difficult and confusing for visitors. If you can't read French, it's almost impossible.

The apartment is in an amazing location (two metro stops very close) and is big for the area! (Deserves 5 stars). Three nice-sized bedrooms with loads of hanging closet space/storage space. Two small balconies, one facing the road and one facing the alley. Both are relaxing to sit on. The kitchen had all the amenities we needed. Nice size bathroom! The water pressure in the shower is very low. As a woman with medium length hair, I had to spend much more time than usual washing out my shampoo/conditioner. 

My main concern is the lack of communication from the host. If you call him, he answers, but if you email him through Airbnb (which he prefers), he either doesn't answer or answers late. With our parking issue when we arrived this was a big deal for us. Just call him for any issues you might have.",9.0

We ran out of toilet paper and the host told us where the new rolls were, but there was only one extra and we had already found and used it. So the last day of our stay was without any. 

I was also thrown off by a racist remark made by the host when we arrived, which came of an unnecessarily prolonged banter when we just wanted to unpack and rest. Probably would not stay here again for this reason alone.",9.0

"We did not meet Rebekah, it was an acquaintance who gave us and took back the keys. We were a family of 4 (a baby and a 4-year-old child).

We liked: the proximity of shops (supermarket, pharmacy, fruit shop, the warm Rose Café), the bus at the foot of the building, the size of the apartment comfortable for 4,
We less liked: the apartment not very clean (cigarette smell, ashtray not emptied, a match in the bedroom - for a non-smoking apartment!! - the parquet that darkened our daughter's knees at four years old, the fridge not stocked, dust under the cushions of the sofas ... and so on), the lack of equipment (broom, vacuum cleaner, dishes to prepare food), the washing machine defective (it broke down after 2 uses, we had to go to the laundromat), the broken lights in both bedrooms (which we repaired), the TV which is actually a screen for watching DVDs, the bedding for the third person in the small closed room is actually a non-convertible sofa of one meter long (our four-year-old son could not sleep on it ...). Rebekah therefore made us use an inflatable mattress.

It's a cheaper apartment, certainly, but not consistent with the description. Good for a couple who likes to eat outdoors.",6.0
"Fannie's apartment is a typical apartment in the Villeray neighborhood with lots of charm. Clean, perfect for a couple! The neighborhood is very nice with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby the apartment. The Jarry metro station is 2 minutes away on foot and allows easy access to downtown Montreal. I highly recommend it without hesitation! We loved this neighborhood so much that we want to move there ;)",9.0
"My accommodation was very warm and pleasant overall. I really enjoyed the neighborhood for its proximity to many places that are dear to me: park, Talon market, Villeray... The metro is very convenient, a 2-minute walk away, in just a few minutes you can find yourself right in the heart of Montreal.

The accommodation itself was enjoyable, but quite dim. The room was super, and the bedding gave us some great nights' sleep. 

Cleaning could be more thorough, as the place didn't breathe very well when we arrived.  Also, there was a minor issue with the neighbors; we had a concert every evening which can be annoying when you come home after a full day in the constant noise of the city. 

Thank you Fannie for being so pleasant and accommodating. Thank you to her for being present when we needed it.",9.0
"I had an amazing time staying in this apartment. It's a great place with a large group of people and everyone is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable. In just a few days, they took me to explore Montreal, helped me with my administrative tasks, and explained the differences between Canada and my home country. We even had some big communal meals... 
I particularly recommend this stay for active people who want to make new friends. There's always someone at the apartment, it's lively, and for those who appreciate that, it can be amazing. 
It's not far from the bus/metro. I was able to get to downtown Montreal multiple times without any problems in a short amount of time. 
The apartment is bigger than the photos show. 
My room was spacious and comfortable. No issues with cleanliness. 
Despite the short duration of my stay, I know I'll keep in touch with my hosts and continue visiting regularly. 

TL;DR: Bigger than the pictures show, nothing negative to say, very lively and a huge plus for the conviviality and charm of the shared living spaces.",10.0

"Super stay. Catherine (Jonathan's roommate) is very nice, cheerful and attentive. It was a real pleasure to be on vacation with them. The accommodation is clean, comfortable and well-equipped (good internet connection; washing machine & dryer; office for working...). The room is quite spacious. The value for money is very good in my opinion. I was able to enjoy the roof terrace before it got too cold. The apartment is well located, there are parks and shops nearby, other shops are not far either, I often walked there (Mont Royal which I like is a 30-minute walk away). There are good restaurants and very good cafes within a 5-minute walk. The metro is about 10-15 minutes away. There's also a bike station and a good grocery store a few minutes away.

The neighborhood is nice, the street is quiet. For those who want to do some shopping or window shopping, they will probably have to take the metro to go a little further. But easily accessible with the metro. 

Very good first Airbnb experience.",10.0

If you want to buy some cheap fruits and vegetables; go to the shop at the corner of Papineau and Beaubien. You also have a great shop at Beaubien and La Roche on the way to the metro. 
You will be able to enjoy the rooftop for sunbathing or an apero at sunset.",10.0

There were small bottles of soap and shampoo on the towels left at my disposal. This was very much appreciated. Catherine is very welcoming and easy to reach. If you are looking for a cute and quiet corner of Montreal, Little Patrie is perfect for you. The only thing I would improve is the dust on the floor in the bedroom and kitchen. Overall, the general experience is positive.",10.0

"Beatrice's place was great. Couldn't complain about anything at all. The location was great, the place was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the kitchen had everything you need to cook and serve a full meal (I didn't get a chance to use it). 

At first I was skeptical about the place because it had no reviews and the main contact number on Airbnb is not a local one. But there was really no reason to be as Beatrice provides you with a direct contact number to her mother, who handed me the keys. 

They were both very accommodating with check-in times. Marie is very sweet; she told me what was around the area and ways to get around. She made sure I had everything I needed before she left. 

I would definitely stay again; it would be my first choice if available on my next trip back to Montreal.",10.0

It was a short walk to the metro, making getting to Mont Royal and the old town easy. Comfortable place to stay.

Only suggestion would be to get groceries before you arrive as there isn't a supermarket nearby.",9.0

"Well-located housing, close to the metro station, easy street parking, spacious enough for 4 people. The air conditioning allowed us to have good nights during this week of heatwave. Points to improve: provide more cutlery (insufficient for 4 people) and add some decor on certain empty walls.

We thank Jason for granting us a late departure so we could watch the France World Cup quarter-final match.",9.0
"The reason I booked Jason's place is because I attended a conference at the Palais de Congres de Montreal. For the price, I would say that I made a good choice! My friend and I drove to Montreal and we didn't arrive until around 2 am. Jason gave very detailed instructions for self check-in which made it really convenient as I wouldn't want to bother him at that time. After we had arrived in  Montreal, we commuted throughout our stay. It is a 7-min walk to the metro and I would say that the neighborhood is pretty quiet and safe (there were times when we went home around 1 am). Jason told me that we could park our car in the backyard which was a bit difficult to find since Jason did not respond when I asked him about it (not a big deal though because my friend and I figured it out eventually). The condo is just as how it looks like in pictures, and I especially loved the kitchen and the bathroom. There were essentials he left for us like soap, shampoo, towels etc. During our stay, we lost Wi-Fi for about a day and Jason fixed it as soon as he could. Overall, our stay was nice. I would book his place again. Thanks Jason!",9.0
"My cousin and I stayed in Montreal for 5 days. The apartment location offered us everything we needed for those few days: easy access to buses and the metro, and a convenience store.  The accommodations were lovely; they offered a fully stocked kitchen that we decided to cook after a trip to the Jean-Talon Market. On evenings we enjoyed relaxing and cooling down in the really good AC. Wifi worked perfectly as (Website hidden by Airbnb) spottiness. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a neighborhood experience, that’s very economical and still connects you to the city in less than 25 minutes.",9.0

The apartment is a 8-minute walk from the Sauvé metro station on the orange line, so convenient for reaching the city center. The entrance is autonomous and therefore allows flexibility for arrival time. Communication with Jason went well too. Only minor drawbacks: the sofa was in poor condition and did not allow for another sleeping arrangement, the lack of decoration and investment in the apartment and the lack of dishes, barely enough for 4.",9.0

"Staying at Sabrina's place in the Plateau neighborhood was the best experience I've ever had as my second time visiting Montreal because she was resourceful and helpful in suggesting to my mother and me trendy restaurants and places to see in Montreal, but most of all her apartment was clean and had everything I needed. I would strongly recommend others to stay at her place. Thank you Sabrina for everything.",9.0
"Sabrina was a very nice woman who was extremely helpful. Her apartment was in a very safe neighborhood and was close to shops, restaurants. I was told I could choose a room. When we arrived, she had placed us in the least appealing room, which was the guest room.  I was more than happy to be there as we were right next to the bathroom and I would have felt very odd taking over her bedroom. She let us use her condiments, which was greatly appreciated. We cooked a lot and she was very respectful of giving us space that we were seeking. Overall, the price was awesome, the area was great, Sabrina was very cool, and so is her decor in her home! Ten times better than a hotel. Home away from home!",9.0

The Plateau neighborhood is one of the most charming and preferred in Montreal, with lots of trees and cute houses with staircases. I truly felt at home. Not only because the apartment had everything I needed, but also because Sabrina is a wonderful person and an excellent host.

"Sabrina's home is just lovely and the perfect place to stay in Montreal. As she had to leave for the first two weeks of my stay, I did not get to see her the whole time, however when she was there she was really nice and made me feel very welcome. Her place became nearly a second home. The pictures are true, it is just so nice as they show it. Her place is in the Plateau, the best place to be when you like being close to restaurants, coffee shops, and alternative stores. Sabrina explained me where to buy organic food and where to go out! I absolutely enjoyed my stay in Montreal. My highlight was definitely when she showed me how to make homemade granola and a delicious lentil soup. I am looking forward to seeing her again and to share a Swiss meal. I can only recommend staying with her, and I will certainly go back.

About the location of the house, I found it very convenient to go anywhere. It's quite close to the center of the city or anywhere. However, it's probably a good idea to have the bus schedule with you all the time so that you wouldn't need to walk for 20 mins to the metro (especially in the winter :P) Besides that, there are lots of stores around to get anything so you wouldn't have any problems! Overall, I absolutely loved it! Thank you Sabrina <3",9.0

She had maps, sticky notes, tour guides, a key, tea, granola, spices, a laundry machine, you name it, she had it covered.  She even contacted me on day two to make sure we were all set. The location is two blocks from Mount Royal. Wonderful boutiques, groceries, cafes, and restaurants. Our only issue was the walk to the metro. We tried the bus, but there wasn't always one. For avid walkers, the 20-minute walk to and fro would not be an issue. I resorted to parking on the street near the metro then walked. Not a big deal.",9.0

The neighborhood was quiet, a bit removed from the city center, accessible by bus and further away from the metro (20 minutes). The building and street did not match our expectations (3rd floor of an apartment building) as we imagined a typical entrance on Mont-Royal plateau with direct access via stairs from the street.",9.0
"Sabrina was a very nice host.

We had a few contacts before my arrival in Montreal. She contacted me to inform me where to find the keys for the apartment in case she wasn't there at the time of my arrival. As it turned out, she was there to meet me and thank God for that, because on my own I would not have been able to carry my 23 kg bag up three floors. The place was neat and tidy, the neighborhood was okay, and Sabrina was a very warm and friendly person.

The location of the apartment was a few metro stops from the city of Montreal.

My five-day stay there was comfortable and pleasant. Thank you, Sabrina, for all your help.

"Sabrina was a very laid-back and friendly host and it was a pleasure to stay at her place. She was flexible about check-in and check-out times and made our stay even better by providing recommendations of places to eat and visit in her area. The neighborhood was very vibrant, with shops, restaurants, cafes, a big park, and a fabulous bakery all within a 10-minute walk. Her place is close to bus routes and we found it to be a great home base for our stay in Montreal. The photos and description on her Airbnb post are accurate, and her place is very clean, stylish, and welcoming. Thanks for a nice experience, Sabrina!",9.0
"When we arrived, Sabrina gave us a tour of her apartment and then sat down to map out all the metro, bus stations, recommended restaurants, etc. After that, she went on her way and we didn't see her the rest of our trip. The apartment itself was in a quiet neighborhood in the Plateau and we were two blocks from small shops and food places. Overall, her place was nice. Note: there is no A/C so it was nice that she had plug-in fans in each room. The only downside was the guest bedroom bed was not very comfortable (but if you like firm mattresses, you will be okay) and the kitchen had ants (which is due to the time of year).",9.0
"Sabrina is an excellent host! She contacted me a couple of days before my arrival to make sure I could get in. She and her boyfriend even helped me carry my bags up the stairs. She was very friendly and immediately gave me a map and some tips for Montreal. The apartment is bright, clean, and charming. The room is large with lots of storage space.  Also, there's a nice bathroom. The apartment was in a quiet neighborhood but close to the city center. There are many bars and restaurants on Mont Royal Street nearby. Highly recommended!",9.0

"The apartment was just about as advertised, save for a few things. Free parking was listed, but there was no parking to be found. We ended up getting a ticket the first day. We eventually found a lot in the city (15 minutes away by Uber) to leave the car for the week, but that was a hassle checking on it all the time. Also, while there is a washer and dryer, it's located in the basement of the apartment for use by all tenants, which costs money, so timing is key. We ended up walking to a laundromat a few blocks away and using that instead. Apart from that, the stay was pleasant and the apartment was comfortable. Several easy restaurant options were nearby.",9.0
We felt very welcome during our stay with Sabrina. The apartment is in a beautiful neighborhood and the location made it easy to explore Montreal.,9.0
"Sabrina was an amazing host. The apartment is beautiful, and just around the corner of Rue du Mont-Royal, which is home to a plethora of shops and restaurants - meaning if you choose to stay here, you have plenty of options for food and shopping. Each morning I went for a walk down the beautiful street and stopped at some coffee shops on the way. It's also just a few minutes walk to the Metro, which is great if you'd like to explore the rest of Montreal. Or you can hop on a Bixi bike close to the apartment and ride downtown. But the best part of the apartment is how close it is to (what I believe to be) the best poutine spot in Montreal - La Banquise. The location is perfect for both young people looking to have an exciting night out and families alike. Sabrina's apartment was clean, fresh, and easy to access. Overall very pleased with my experience. Thank you, Sabrina!",9.0
"Sabrina provided a welcoming stay in Montreal. Her apartment is cozy and she made sure that I felt at home, although I only saw her a couple of times.

"It was a really good experience at Sabrina's place, she was so kind and open to my comments and to talk with me about anything, she was always looking after me if I needed something else. 
Great communication in English and if you know Spanish she will be glad to practice with you.
There are several bus routes that can take you wherever you want, and they all connect with the metro system using the same boarding card.",9.0
"Sabrina was so great. She had these little maps and cool places to go check out in the city. I stayed here while looking for a more permanent place to live and she was incredibly helpful!

"Sabrina was great! The check-in process was super easy, she was very accommodating with my check-in time. The room was very nice and spacious. Her place is close to a lot of major bus routes which made transportation very easy. She also had lots of suggestions for places to go and experience. Overall, it was a great stay.",9.0
"Sabrina is beyond lovely and her home is too! She was very flexible for my late check-in/late check-out. The home was clean, quiet and beautiful with lots of natural light (the apartment building does not have an elevator). It's located in a very nice area close to bus routes a block or two away in every direction, a convenience store on the corner, a handful of restaurants very nearby, as well as Mont-Royal Ave a block away which has tons of shops, cafes, restaurants, grocery stores, bars, pharmacies, a metro station and access to the top of Mont-Royal Park further down. She provides the essentials, water/towels, space in the hallway closet, space in the cupboard/fridge in the kitchen, wifi access, ability to adjust the temperature of the room and a washing machine for laundry if needed (hang dry only though). Communication was easy and I appreciated the help/suggestions when I had questions but also the privacy I was given at other times. I would 150% stay here again and highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in a nice neighborhood outside of the city but still with access to many things to do! Thank you again Sabrina!",9.0

When I didn't meet Raed during my trip as he was abroad, he was very welcoming and ready to provide help and tips when needed. I can then strongly recommend Raed's place.",10.0
"The apartment is located in a fantastic area, two seconds from the Metro station, walkable to the plateau and downtown. A Bixi bike stop is right beside the Metro as well.

I was extended for work and there were literally no hotel rooms that met my work cost guidelines. Raed's apartment was cheaper and infinitely better than the room I was staying in and was closer to the metro too.

Raed made check-in a breeze and worked with me when my plans changed for checkout. He was available via text and phone and helped me all the way through.

Next time I'm in Montreal, this will be my first choice of accommodation.",10.0

The apartment is in a fantastic location and Raed was a very accommodating host. Fantastic place to stay.,10.0
"This is a great apartment and Raed is a very nice and accommodating host. However, I had a couple of issues with this trip. This is nothing against Raed or his place. Both the apartment and the host are great. Just a few logistical, subjective-comfort, and communication related things. 

When asking Raed about potential noise in the apartment, before I booked, he said ""this is all very subjective... it should be fine."" When I got to the apartment, there was major construction (which begins around (8-9AM) surrounding the apartment (the apartment is on a right angle on a major intersection near Place de Arts) and the music from nearby festivals (very loud) begins in the afternoon and ends late at night around 11PM-12AM. 

I was aware of how close the festivals were, but based on Raed's comment, I figured it would be relatively quiet and didn't anticipate such loud music and construction. I was a bit annoyed when I got to the apartment and for the first few days, I was bombarded with construction early in the morning and then blaring music for most of the day. This may have been miscommunication, or maybe it is a new issue, but I felt somewhat misled. Now this might not bother anyone else, which is fine. But I did ask about the noise level before I booked. And yet, the experience I had wound up contradicting what I had been told by the host. So make sure you ask specific questions if you have specific concerns. And if you are looking for quiet during the day — good luck!

There was also some initial confusion when trying to book the apartment because the dates that were listed as available were not actually all available. In fact, I had to change my reservation from June 12-26 to June 12-20 because Raed had his own plans with the apartment from the 20th onward but this was not reflected on AirBnB and it wasn’t until after I booked my dates that I found out the the apartment wouldn’t be available after the 20th. This lack of clarity in communication was pretty inconvenient for me. Plus, I had to wait to hear back from and constantly inquire with Raed when trying to find out the actual available dates to see if the apartment was going to be available or not. Even after I booked, the dates listed as available remained inaccurate. If I didn't keep contacting him, I'm not sure how things would have turned out. This put a some stress on my travel plans, which were admittedly very last minute. I realize Raed was probably very busy, but it's always the little, logistical things that matter.

Despite these relatively minor issues, I must state that Raed was very accommodating and responsive during my actual trip, very friendly, and in the end - he was very considerate by allowing me to check out a few days early.

Great apartment. Great host.",10.0
"The location is ideal, right on Place des Arts, and the apartment itself is very enjoyable to live in.  Above all, Raed is an extremely kind and attentive host. Overall, I highly recommend both the apartment and its host. Definitely my go-to place for future trips to Montreal.",10.0

I would definitely recommend it to friends and will look for it on my next visit.",10.0

"This was a beautiful stay, much appreciated. Raed and Hidaya were accommodating in every way, kind, generous, and flexible. The home was immaculate, better than a 5-Star Hilton.

"The location is phenomenal. You could honestly park your car and toss your transportation passes. This place is close to everything. The host was mostly responsive. 

Only issue I had was not having access to the rooftop for the entire 7 days I stayed. The nice rooftop is included in the description for this place, so that was a major selling point for me to book the space, making it simply disappointing that I didn’t have access. The host was not able to provide an answer on how to get access to the rooftop. Finally, I booked the entire apartment, and it was listed as full apartment access. The room you actually get is the smaller room with the bed that looks more slim and less comfortable. I had a good rest in the room I slept in, but I assumed that having the apartment to myself would allow me to sleep in the nicer room that is actually pictured on the website. Not sure why it is pictured if it is not available to potential guests. 

Outside of those things, Raed was very quick to respond and good to work with.  

I would return to this Airbnb, unless a place with proper rooftop access is available.

"My wife and I stayed here for only one night and it's truly one of the best Airbnb stays we've ever experienced! The hosts were there on arrival and so pleasant and helpful with directions and ideas of things to do. The apartment is a five-minute walk to the Olympic stadium and underground metro system. Also, bars and restaurants within a 10-minute walk (Le Blind Pig and Tannerie were very good!). It's such a nice place to stay with absolutely everything you could need AND more! Basic provisions in the fridge which were most welcomed after a long drive. Comfy bed. Excellent wifi. Small balcony to sit outside. We will definitely be coming back next time we're in Montreal and staying for longer, thank you both for your kindness and hospitality!",10.0
"My daughter and I had an amazing time staying at William's place. He prepared many things for us: snacks, basic ingredients for cooking, some juice, and even homemade cookies! The house was extremely clean and everything was very well organized. We received immediate responses to our requests. The house was a 2-minute walk from the subway, which was a great convenience. We hope we can stay at William's place again when we have the chance to go back to Canada.",10.0

Communications with William and Sue were prompt and informative.  The check-in and check-out were very easy. I appreciated the welcoming muffins and cookies, in addition to the basic foods left in the fridge and kitchen cupboards. 

Both William and Sue were welcoming and hospitable, making the stay most comfortable and enjoyable.",10.0

"I've stayed in many Airbnbs and this one deserves a prize. Expectations were high with all of the great reviews and everything was just as good, or better, than what the other reviews claim. The area is quiet and residential, not bustling like downtown Montreal and you need to walk a few blocks for anything, including the subway which is very convenient. Very close to the botanical garden (+great restaurant) and the impressive Olympic sports center where you can get a day pass for $6. Will be back!",10.0
"Fantastic location! I am a very regular Airbnb user, and this accommodation completely won me over! 

Cozy, well-furnished, affordable and comfortable, it is in a very good location, in a quiet neighborhood and very close to public transportation. The fully autonomous entrance, extremely simple, is a big plus.

William and Susan are discreet, charming but extremely attentive and professional hosts. Nothing is left to chance and the little touches inside are divine. 

My new must-have!",10.0

"This was my first time using Airbnb so I was not sure what to expect. Susan and William absolutely blew me away with their hospitality and kindness. We drove in a bit late into Montreal but Susan came out to greet and welcome us. The apartment was extremely clean and organized. There was coffee available, cupboards and fridge had food for our disposal and the nicest touch was the homemade bakery items and crepes. There was also a private parking spot available for our car, which was appreciated. If we had any questions or concerns, Susan would respond within minutes and would ensure the problem is taken care of on the spot. When we come to Montreal in the future, we will most definitely book this apartment again instead of going to a hotel!",10.0
"This is an extremely clean and well-kept accommodation. You will find all the usual amenities plus more, such as a refrigerator stocked with eggs, homemade jam, milk, margerine, and condiments, etc. You are greeted by an array of home baked muffins and cookies. Communication was easy and excellent when we had a problem with the cable service. William and Susan were there in a flash to help us out. This one-bedroom apartment is in an ideal location for walking to the Botanical Gardens, Olympic stadium, and Biodome, and has easy access to the metro and bus service. Very quiet...like a little oasis in the city of Montreal.",10.0
"We recommend William and Susan’s Place to anyone traveling to Montreal!!

The hosts are delightful, the place is immaculate, beautiful, comfortable, and VERY well-equipped. They obviously take great pride in offering an exceptional experience  to their guests. 

In addition, the location is excellent - situated in a quiet tree lined neighborhood, very close to the metro which is very clean and efficient. In addition, the wonderful Olympic Park is close by with its gorgeous botanical gardens and much more. We felt very comfortable strolling around the area. 

A good grocery store and casual dining spots are nearby; very convenient!

Truly an A-Plus choice!!",10.0
"For proof of our satisfaction, this is the second time we've stayed at the Ideal. 

The apartment has seen its equipment improved (air conditioning, Dyson vacuum cleaner, etc.). And there are always welcome cookies (homemade) and a couple/few odds and ends in the fridge for surviving the first few moments (being able to make a good coffee without having to go shopping right away, for example).

In short, a great condo, with great people. Go for it with confidence. But not when we return there ourselves;-)",10.0

"Probably the best Airbnb I have been to, and I've been to quite a few entire apartment Airbnbs. William and Sue were great hosts. We arrived late at night and Sue walked out in the rain and freezing weather to make sure we were able to get in safely. They also left homemade treats and some food in the fridge! 

As for the apartment, it's located very close to the metro station so we had no trouble accessing the city at all. The apartment was pretty much spotless. The sheets smelled clean, every room was very clean. I was very happy with my stay here and would absolutely recommend it. You won't regret it!",10.0

"I enjoyed a comfortable and restful stay at William and Susan's cozy, immaculate apartment. The cleanliness, amenities, and warm personal touches made me feel immediately at home. The thought and care that they put into creating a welcoming space were evident throughout. As hosts, they showed the perfect blend of attentiveness, warmth, and professionalism that made our communications and interactions pleasant and easy.

I appreciated having a fully equipped kitchen and staple pantry items such as pasta for complimentary use. (Groceries at Marche Maisonneuve were a quick ride away on the 139 bus from Pie-IX station.) The sparkling new appliances and furnishings and modern heating system made for a comfortable, problem-free stay in late-November temperatures.  Entering and exiting the apartment was safe and easy, with the keyless lock system in place.

Thoughtful touches included plentiful linens, spare umbrellas in the closet, and various toiletry/personal care items available for use. Susan checked in regularly to make sure our stay was going well.

The location was convenient: easy access to the center of the city, but removed enough for a quiet retreat from the bustle. I enjoyed catching a glimpse of everyday life in the residential Hochelaga-Maisonneuve neighborhood. (College de Maisonneuve, literally across the street, serves post-high school/pre-college students, coming and going throughout the day.)

Staying at L’Ideal on our first trip to Montreal and as our first use of Airbnb was a choice I was glad to have made. I look forward to returning to Montreal (am now very much a fan) and staying here again.",10.0
"Wow! I am a very picky person and not easily impressed, but staying at this Airbnb exceeded all my expectations! Everything was exactly as promised. Communication and information was precise, great location, off-street parking, private entrance and the apartment was exceptionally clean and updated. William and Sue even provided homemade treats and stocked many basics such as coffee, milk and more. They were friendly and attentive while still respecting one's privacy. Great hosts and a great service - I would definitely stay again! Thanks William and Sue.",10.0
Second time at Will & Sue's was just as wonderful as the first. The little snacks she leaves are a real nice touch for a true bed and breakfast experience. The place is perfect and the hosts are there for you when you need them late on New Year's Eve and can't find any food. But they give you plenty of space. Really feels like home away from home.

For the location and accessibility of this place, we should have definitely paid higher. We were located very close in between two train lines 5 min walking distance of that, a strip of clubs, stores, restaurants, etc while being right in the middle of downtown, so the value of this place exceeds expectations. If you are a peace and quiet person and don't prefer the city life then this location is not for you because it is a non-stop party area with plenty to do.

"Yves was an excellent host. He kept in near constant contact with me via Airbnb and email before our stay, and during our stay was always reachable by phone. He has a beautiful apartment in a great part of the city. Yves was an excellent host as well. We had a great time talking to and getting to know him during our stay in Montreal. He gave us some great recommendations on places to go and things to do. The next time I visit Montreal, I hope I'll be lucky enough to stay with him again.",10.0
"Yves and his friend Nadine were very hospitable. Communication was spot-on. Upon arrival, we were greeted with quality complementary chocolate, red wine, and OJ. The apartment was plenty large for my wife and me. Location was very convenient as it was one block from the shops and food on St Denis, but was also isolated from late-night noise.

A nice benefit is roof access. We had a nice brunch on the roof with some takeout from one of the local cafes. 

I would return again.",10.0
"Yves' apartment is super well-located in the heart of the entertainment district. There's everything he needs around his place to enjoy Montreal by day and night! His welcome was more than warm, a big smile, a super joy of living and enough to make a hearty breakfast (bread, fruit, juice, Ferrero Rocher...)!! Going to Yves is ensuring a good stay in Montreal, enjoying an apartment where there's life after all, that's what we love about Airbnb!! You can book with your eyes closed!",10.0
"Yves Loft was exactly as he described it; it was clean, tidy, and spacious. He was kind enough to leave food, coffee, drinks, and snacks for us. His place had everything we needed, and was located in a convenient spot. I would definitely recommend Yves and his loft, and I hope to rent it again.",10.0
"We had a great stay at Yves' place. We booked last minute and were unable to get there in time to meet Yves in person (he had a flight to catch), but his communication was excellent and we were able to get into his place with no problem. The location was great - near the metro, walking distance of Old Montreal, Mont Royal, etc, tons of places to eat on Rue St. Denis and in the surrounding neighborhoods. His flat itself was just as described and very clean. We would certainly stay again.",10.0
"Both Yves and his loft were awesome! Met me at the loft, was very communicative. Left wine and chocolates, amongst toiletries and other things for my wife and I.

Fantastic location, about a 1 minute walk to Rue Saint-Denis, full of restaurants/bars and great nightlife. Parking is super easy, two cheap garages in walking distance.",10.0
"The experience of Yves' loft begins with the welcome. Yves is a very friendly host and puts you at ease from your arrival, with bonus snacks, juice, ground coffee, and red wine. Coming myself from Montreal, the loft is strategically positioned. You are within walking distance of the Berri metro station, the heart of the city and subway lines.  You're in the entertainment district, at the center of artistic life and terraces, but you don't hear any noise despite the proximity of the dynamic St-Denis street. The bed is very comfortable, the place is VERY clean. Are you coming in the summer? Fans and air conditioning guarantee a cool night.  The building is very secure with a modern key system with code at the door. As a bonus there's a small café at the exit of the building. Tired? Want to see a movie? The Quartier Latin cinema is 20 meters from your door. I have finally found my favorite place during my visits to Montreal.  - Simon D Scott",10.0
"I booked the listing last minute on my way to Toronto from Halifax. Yves made necessary arrangements for the keys to be delivered at a late check-in at 8pm (thanks to his charming friend). Although I didn't get a chance to meet him, he welcomed me with chocolate, snacks, and a few drinks. His loft is bright, spacious, and clean; I was intrigued by the beautiful decor, cool artistic pieces, and overall flow. I enjoyed the location, close to many bookstores, music shops, restaurants, boutiques, and transit. In short, I didn't really have to go past 1km to find everything I needed. Yves is a superhost. I highly recommend his place.",10.0
"Yves was a lovely host. He made arrangements for us to drop off our bags even though we arrived several hours before check-in, left snacks and drinks, and was overall very gracious during our stay. The place was perfectly clean, spacious, beautiful, and centrally located. It was extremely close to a number of bars and restaurants, as well as the metro and bus stations, not to mention a short walk from Old Port and the rest of downtown Montreal. We would highly recommend this location! Thank you for a wonderful weekend! Best, LeeAnne and Alina.",10.0

"This was my second Airbnb experience, but my first for Montreal. After years of doing hotels, I've decided to use Airbnb when I can. I've heard great experiences and horrible experiences, so I was apprehensive once again. I was so pleasantly surprised with Yves's place. After a few hours of being in someone else's living space, I felt very comfortable. I didn't meet Yves, but check-in and entry was very easy and convenient, which is what I need and want. Great location—just minutes walk to one of the main transit stations. Very cool location, and very clean, tidy, and uncluttered loft with character. Yves prepares for his guests, which was very welcoming and appreciated—milk, juice, snacks, tea/coffee, essential toiletries, tourist/travel info, ...and for me wine. For 4 days, I felt very comfortable having my own personal space, which surpasses the hotel experience. Thanks again, Yves",10.0

There are many shops nearby and the room overlooks a very quiet street. We had access to all the apartment's amenities and the room was fully equipped, which is very practical for our first arrival in Montreal.

"Pictures do not perfectly capture Frédérique's place. I LOVED staying here. The house is warm and cozy. The decor is carefully chosen and Frédérique has done a lot to create a Zen and private room for her guests.

I work remotely, so it was important to have a quiet environment where I could work and have high-speed internet access. Her home provided both.

As a host, I enjoyed meeting Frédérique. She is easygoing, fun to talk to, and is as involved as you want her to be. She was a host when I went to Montreal, and a friend when I left Montreal.

I highly recommend staying at her place. It is perfect for solo adventures or a couple.",10.0

"I am really lucky to have had my first Airbnb stay at Frédérique's home. Before my arrival, she always responded promptly and was very helpful. I went to Montreal for a conference and it was also my first time in Canada. Frédérique's home is very stylish and you can tell that she made a great effort to decorate the place.  The most important thing was that she is very generous to share the nice apartment with her guests. I could access the living room, balcony, and the well-equipped kitchen. The oven, washing machine, and dryer were new and they were functioning very well. There are also two lovely cats. After a whole day conference, it was really nice to relax with the cats and some homemade food and local wine. I also love the brunch place Frédérique showed me. The food was so delicious. I will definitely reserve Frédérique's place if I ever go back to Montreal and I will also recommend this place to my friends who are going to Montreal.",10.0

The apartment itself is a good size, perfect for three people, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We planned on cooking some of our meals but realized the oven was not working so only stovetop meals would work. The other appliances are very outdated but for the most part, functional.

"This apartment was great for my friends and me having a weekend in the city. It's a good location within walking distance of plenty of restaurants, cafes, and things to do during the day. The apartment was small as expected, but we weren't in it much so it served its purpose. We paid to park in the garage which was very tight; it has a 6ft clearance and it was more than tricky to drive through. The apartment smelled like cigarettes when we first arrived and the bathroom smelled like spilled milk, which was disquieting to say the least. After turning on the AC unit the cigarette smell eventually went away, but the bathroom couldn't be aired out very much.

The apartment overlooks the main street which is full of nightlife and restaurants. With the windows open it could be a bit noisy, but when they are closed it was very quiet so it was not an issue! Having the metro so close made traveling the city very easy. The biggest challenge was parking; if you plan to have a car your only decent overnight options require you to walk quite a bit.

Great windows and lots of light and views of St. Catherine Street which is pedestrian only in the summer. Lots of fun. 
There are two long sets of stairs up to get to the apartment so pack lightly. Also the air conditioner had a hard time keeping the front bedroom cool.",9.0

Wonderful apartment, spacious, clean, fully equipped, comfortable, decorated with taste, bright, quiet, ... And for such a small price. Best value at that price point.

Location

Outside the center of Montreal, yet close to everything. 5-10min walk to green line subway station, 1min walk to line 107 bus stop, 10min subway to old Montreal, nice walk along the river just next to the apartment, market on street corner, bakery 5min walk away... Perfect for a romantic stay.

The kitchen is fully furnished if you want to cook there (although during our stay the oven wasn't working, but the stovetop was), coffee is provided, there's a washer and dryer in the unit (with detergents provided!), the living room was lovely although the TV didn't have a DVD player. The bedrooms were wonderful - comfy beds and full-size mirrors and hanging racks in both. Even a clothes steamer. The bathroom was lovely too - best shower we've had all trip! Amazing water pressure and soft towels. Basically, lots of attention to detail made this stay just perfect! And the host was very kind and easy to work with. Communication was easy, although not excessive, and she made sure we had everything we needed. Isn't the ideal location in the city if you want to walk to attractions, but you could tell that by a map. We knew that going in, but it was such a good deal and cozy stay it was worth it for sure!",10.0

All the touches are there to make for a lovely stay - comfortable, quiet bedrooms, a kitchen equipped for a brewed coffee or cooking up a storm, a clean, sleek bathroom.

"Lovely, clean and comfortable second-floor townhouse flat. Need to be able to climb the winding external stairs (very common in this neighborhood). Enjoyed the full kitchen for morning coffee and DIY breakfast before heading out for the day. Great location - just ""outside the city"" enough to enjoy quiet evenings, but a few steps from the bus stop to the metro for easy access anywhere else. Bank for ATM just down the street, along with lots of restaurants, and a fresh fruit vendor on the corner. Get yourself a transport pass and enjoy Montreal!",10.0

The flat is very spacious (2 bedrooms) and well-organized, very clean, and very much as advertised (""bright, cozy, quiet"").  The location, with easy access to public transit (both bus and metro) to get downtown or around southwest Montreal and also being a short walk from the St. Lawrence River and its walk/bike pathway, can't be beat. Given all of these positives, it is also a great value. I will always stay here when visiting Montreal if Emma's flat is available.",10.0
"Spacious, clean, cozy apartment. Enjoyed it very much. Good base to see the city from, either by car (there is parking in front) or subway (walking distance from station). Quiet residential neighborhood. The only thing worth noting if someone has accessibility needs is that there is a bit of a steep staircase to reach the apartment. It worked out well for us and we would stay here again.",10.0

The banks of the Saint Laurent are very close and relaxing, the Verdun metro station is a 15-minute walk away but a bus connects it. A grocery store full of tempting products is located at the corner of the street.

Emma was able to respond quickly and efficiently to any minor problems that arose. It's very easy to contact her and have a conversation with her.",10.0
"The apartment is bright, spacious, very clean and located in a very quiet neighborhood close to all amenities (bus, metro, shops, service station...)

"Our stay at Emma's apartment was nice. Spacious, cozy! I fell in love with her couch:). It would have been 200% top experience if the housemaid had cleaned the apartment properly before we arrived. My mother-in-law is very sensitive to cleanliness. We contacted Emma and she reacted quickly and fixed this issue the day after. Emma is easy to contact, even if she lives in the apartment downstairs, she is very discreet. She is easygoing and has good advice on what to do in Montreal. Anyway, for the rest we really enjoyed our stay and felt comfortable. I recommend this place. Perfect for couples or small families.",10.0
"This apartment is spacious, bright, modern and clean. The fans were very helpful to keep us cool at night. Laundry was also a convenient addition, and there is even a steamer for any formal wear. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you'd need to make a few meals, and there is a little produce market on the corner. A nice walk to Verdun Metro station although wouldn't do this alone at night. The neighbors were very friendly. Loved the iconic outdoor spiral staircase, although I imagine this is tough in winter. Will be recommending this place to friends. It's quite a bargain for exploring the neighborhoods of Montreal.",10.0
"Emma is a great host! Her apartment is nice, cozy, clean and located in a nice neighborhood. There's a great small grocery store right next corner and a very nice breakfast place two blocks away. There are also many playgrounds within walking distance (10 minutes) right by the water, which we really appreciated. We traveled with our two kids (4 and 2) and even they got up very early (jetlag) there were no complaints. Thanks for that and sorry again! We enjoyed our stay very much!",10.0

The street is quiet, the apartment sunny, well-ventilated, and for this season, the heating is efficient.
Thank you Emma for her friendly welcome.",10.0

I stayed for a month in this comforting and quiet space. Everything a traveler needs in a lovely neighborhood within a 10-minute walk of the Metro. The fast internet connection was a nice plus.

"We enjoyed our stay at Nicole's apartment. It is a very nice neighborhood. Convenient for us as it is close to where our son lives with his family. The apartment is nice, well-equipped, a bit quirky but comfortable. Our hostess was most gracious and accommodating. There are a couple of drawbacks for some people. We had hoped to have a queen-size bed, which did not happen. And if you have trouble walking up 32 steps, it may not be for you. All in all, a nice place to stay.

"Unfortunately, my stay at Daniel's apartment was not good. Despite the excellent location, the apartment only accommodates a couple. My husband and I were traveling with our 15-year-old daughter, and the apartment had only one double bed and the third accommodation was a punctured air mattress. We immediately notified Daniel about the issue, but it took him 12 hours to respond and he demanded a photo of the punctured mattress to verify the information. As it was Christmas Eve, he informed us that we couldn't buy a new one or borrow another mattress and that we were unlucky. We stayed there for another three days alternating between my daughter and I on a two-seater sofa so as not to sleep on the floor in full Canadian winter. Furthermore, there was no washing machine or dryer as advertised. I recommend this place only for couples; it's not suitable for families and Daniel is an unreliable host.",9.0

"A very unique place within walking distance of most amenities. The space is relatively small but you won't be spending most of your time indoors, so it shouldn't be a big deal. Adding plungers for each bathroom would definitely improve some people's experience because you never know.

Everything was as described beforehand, check-in and checkout worked flawlessly, so we could start the adventure right away. 
The insulation of the window front is a bit inconvenient at very cold temperatures, but if you use the curtains and cover the underside, it's also a great apartment even at -15°C. Communication with Daniel worked very well, although not all questions were fully answered. (Which for me is definitely no negative point ;) )

The location is an ideal starting point for exploring Downtown!

"The host kept in contact and answered all my questions. The self check-in was smooth and efficient. The studio was very clean, cozy, with all the necessities; it does have a small bathroom that cannot fit two people at the same time, but this wasn't a problem for us. The studio is across from a fire station, so if you are a light sleeper it may not be the best place for you. I suggest placing a mat to keep salt/rocks during the winter seasons! However, it was a very good stay!",9.0

The bedroom in which I stayed was very comfortable, there were fresh bed linens and towels ready for my arrival and the host made me feel welcomed. Patrick has a very spacious, nicely decorated apartment, that is in a great neighborhood close to the metro. The directions on how to arrive at the apartment using public transportation were fantastic. Patrick has a busy work schedule but I was able to enjoy a chat with him and having something to eat together. Would definitely recommend Patrick as a host to travelers going to Montreal.",9.0

A very good welcome from Patrick in a pleasant room and apartment. Thank you Patrick and see you soon!,9.0

"Great host, clean room. Beautiful apartment. Not very central, but easy to get places by metro.",9.0
"Gorgeous old apartment with plenty of character in a beautiful neighborhood, a 5-minute walk from the metro station. It's a little ways from Downtown Montreal but there are plenty of shops and restaurants around the corner. Patrick is a great host, the bed was very comfy and the apartment was easy to find. Looks exactly like the pictures. Very quiet at night, the dog doesn't make any noise and is very calm.

I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you appreciate historic homes and wooded neighborhoods.",9.0

"I had a comfortable stay at Patrick's house. He gave me good advice on where to look around. His place is spacious, tidy, and the location is great for foodies since the famous Jean-Talon market is within walking distance from the house. I can't help but go back for more oysters and cheeses. If you feel like cooking yourself, you can get the freshest produce at Jean-Talon. And it's a 3-minute walk to the subway, which takes just 20 minutes to reach downtown. Patrick's dog, Jarva, is super cute and friendly; he's very easy to get along with.",9.0

"Patrick was great, the room was great, and the location was great. His dog was friendly and never barked when we snuck in late. We would have hung out more but our schedules didn't align. All of his suggestions were spot-on; if we return to Montreal, we will definitely try to stay with him again.",9.0
"I had booked another room but since there was a problem with that listing, I went to Patrick’s place. So it was a very last minute booking but he kindly accommodated me. He was very fast in answering the messages. Patrick and his girlfriend recommended some interesting restaurants, so ask them for that! ;)
The room was very clean with a comfortable bed. Also Patrick provided me some towels. The dog was very friendly, quiet, and respectful. The place was close to the metro (5 mins) so you can reach downtown in 25 mins.",9.0

Their apartment, decorated with a lot of taste, is spacious, clean, and well-maintained. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly, with the metro and all sorts of shops nearby. In short, another good reason for me to return to Montreal is to pay a little visit to Patrick and Edith.",9.0
"We had a terrific stay at Patrick's place. The neighborhood was quiet and very lovely. The subway is just a five-minute walk, making the Jean Talon Market among many other sites and attractions easily accessible. The apartment itself was just as advertised, but with even more charm and was very clean. Patrick himself is very kind and responsive. I highly recommend staying with Pat and his cute dog (who is totally gentle and calm).",9.0
"Thank you again, Patrick and Edith, for your warm welcome! We look forward to seeing you in Montreal!",9.0
I chose this apartment because it looked really chic and it absolutely didn't disappoint me. All the rooms are well-furnished (a sofa and several very comfortable chairs).

Patrick and his girlfriend were very accommodating and respectful. I felt like home. A really excellent choice for a stay in Montreal.,9.0
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Patrick and his lovely girlfriend. Their apartment was beautiful and conveniently located for public transportation. There is also a street just two blocks south with plenty of delicious restaurants and a lush park as well; the neighborhood is perfect and gave us a real sense of authentic Montreal while avoiding the overrun tourist areas. Their dog Java was a sweet heart and always the first to welcome us in. The hosts were a great resource and gave us many recommendations of things to do and places to visit during our stay. Overall, we had a terrific stay in Montreal and would love to return soon!",9.0

Patrick's place was perfect and its great location made it super convenient to get around! The apartment is just as amazing as it looks in the photos and everything is kept in great condition.

I would 100% recommend staying here to anybody and would gladly come back the next time I'm in the city.,9.0
"This is by far my best Airbnb experience! 
Patrick and Edith are not just a lovely couple but wonderful human beings.  They were very amicable and were always available for any help or guidance.  About the place, it is designed and decorated with artsy touches, minimal yet deep, and very clean too. It has a pretty tranquil vibe to it and their dog and cat would be very nice company. For me, the balcony was the cherry on top.  The metro is 5 mins walk away and the grocery store is steps away - which is awesome.  And yeah, they have some pretty amazing recommendations so don't forget to ask them. :)

Will definitely visit again, highly recommended!",9.0

She was also very helpful, understanding, and accommodating. I would definitely recommend her to anyone wanting to visit Montreal. I will definitely come again!!!",9.0
"I did not love this place, though the pictures on the profile looked super nice! It was dirty and hardly anything in the kitchen. A few plates and glasses, a small pot and pan - not for making any dinners at home. I even had to get my own coffee cup! Also, the bed was very hard for me, but others might like that. 
I will not visit here again.",9.0
"First time visiting Montreal and we couldn't have picked a better place. The condo was within walking distance of everything. Restaurants, shopping, transit - it's near everything.

"Here is the translated text:

Will list a few key things to help other travelers out:

- The loft is wonderful and perfect for a couple or family of 3-4. The bed is a double, which makes it a tight fit for two adults but it gets the job done.
- The location is definitely A+ and you will be extremely happy. It's within walking distance to a plethora of restaurants, shopping, as well as miscellaneous stores (Shoppers Drugmart, Convenience Store, etc.).
- Bixi bikes are located within 20 feet of the entrance/exit, making it even more enjoyable to ride a bike throughout Montreal.
- Uber is extremely accessible to and from this space, and I didn't spend more than $20 to get from the Airbnb to the casino, Schwartz Deli, Old Montreal, etc.
- The host provided us with towels, cleaning supplies, soap, etc., for our stay although we did use our own.
- Pictures in the listing are 100% accurate and you won't see any surprises.
- Wifi is also available at this location as well for those who rack up data usage.

Overall, I give this space a 5/5. This was my first Airbnb stay as well as my first time in Montreal, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will be booking this space again if I do come back to Montreal soon.

The room is more than what you need. The bed is big enough for two people, and you have space in the room to put all your luggage. Even though they say the room is under construction, I think it's more than what you need for a few days.

The apartment is very clean, and they allow you to use the kitchen to cook. 

They both speak English and French; Collin is German, and Sandy is really good at Spanish, so language shouldn't be a problem.

The location is great, so overall it's a great place to spend a few days getting around Montreal",9.0

Colin is an open, welcoming, kind (and handy ;) ) person and it's very pleasant to chat and spend time with him. The apartment is very well located, beautifully decorated, and the room very nice. Metro, Montroyal Park, small restaurants, shops, and a bakery are all nearby. We highly recommend a stay with them and we will definitely return without hesitation.",9.0

"Sandy and Collin's flat is located in central Montreal, a few hundred meters from Mont Royal station. The block is nice, with a park not far away as well as a supermarket. 

The flat description matches the pictures on Airbnb; it is just bright, clean, and cool. 

Collin will advise on great places to get a beer or eat, having maybe thousands of good addresses for food (thanks again for Trip de Bouffe!).

We travelled with our little 14-month-old boy who faced jetlag and woke up every day at 5 AM. Nevertheless, Sandy and Collin remained very patient and we are very grateful for that.

In summary: a good place to stay to visit Montreal.",9.0
"A perfect spot to launch our Montreal exploration! We parked the car at the neighboring pay lot and didn't drive during our entire stay. Colin is a very nice, quiet & accommodating host. The room was lovely, a little warm on a couple of the hot nights, but otherwise very comfortable. The neighborhood is very active, but the apartment is nicely located down a quiet side street. 

Note that the apartment is on the second floor, which might be an issue for those with disabilities.

We look forward to returning!",9.0

After driving 13 hours we got in way late and arrived finding the room exactly as pictured, and everything fresh, tidy, and clean. We awoke to find ourselves in the heart of Montreal, half a block from Mont Royal and a short walk to this lovely park.  We just stayed the day and another night, and didn't even really get a chance to meet Colin, but it was a perfect place for our short stay. The brochures and maps of Montreal in our bedroom were a nice touch!",9.0
"The Collin Experience…. That’s how I describe my trip to Montreal. Collin made my friend and I feel like we were visiting a friend rather than staying with a stranger. He was very warm, welcoming and accommodating. The listing was more than described the view from the terrace made for a perfect place to just relax with a couple of the local IPAs from the area. The backyard has a quant little seating area where you can enjoy a private conversation in the morning with a cup of Espresso. Collin directed us in all the right directions for AMAZING food and places off the touristy path. Best trip to Montreal I’ve had and I think it will be returning once a year around the same time :) Thanks Collin for making me and my friend feel right at home in a new place.",9.0
"It was my first experience with Airbnb and it was great.

Sandy (whom I met briefly) and Collin were very welcoming, and I felt like at a friend's place. Their apartment is no more nor less than what was displayed in the pictures. 

While the flat is very close to a lively avenue, I can confirm what I had read in a previous comment (I think ?) : it's very livable. You don't hear much noise, so the location is great too, in addition to being convenient for public transportation.

You can really have confidence in Collin's recommendations for places to eat: He knows! 
The French bakery he would recommend you has delicious croissants (and the compliment comes from a Frenchman). Also I had my best dinner in Canada (meal and wines from Québec) at a bistro he suggested to me, at the corner, 100m from their place.

To conclude, I was very satisfied with my four-day stay at their place.",9.0
Colin's place is awesome and the neighborhood fantastic. He's a cool guy and we had fun staying at his place. I can definitely recommend him as a perfect host.,9.0
"The location is AMAZING! Not only because there's the best boulangerie in town, but also because you are right in the heart of the Plateau, smack dab between Mile End and Center/Vieux Montreal neighborhoods. Colin was so nice, wanting to connect with us and get our feedback about the city and giving us some good tips. We felt like we were staying at a friend's house. He really makes you feel comfortable during your stay at his home.",9.0
"I stayed at Collin's place for over two weeks during Quebec's glorious fall season while on a sabbatical visit at Concordia University, and I greatly enjoyed it - it's spacious and functional and located in a very vibrant area full of quirky eateries, cafes, and shops, and within walking distance of Mont Royal where I did some wonderful hikes amidst the changing foliage. Considering the nightlife in the neighborhood, it's not a completely tranquil place - the bedroom faces a small residential street near the corner of one of the main drags (Avenue Mont-Royal), but you can still get a good night's rest if you're not hypersensitive to occasional outdoor acoustics. Both Collin and I had busy schedules, so we didn't coincide on a daily basis, but one night we shared a fantastic meal whose ingredients had been grown organically on urban rooftops in Montreal. Highly delicious + recommended!",9.0
"Our host was very helpful and answered my queries promptly. We only met once and he was very friendly and made us feel welcome.  The room we had was as described and very clean as was the bathroom. The apartment was a bit smaller than we had hoped, but we made do as we weren't there very much ourselves. The location is the most attractive feature, being only 1 block from several main streets with loads of restaurants, bars, and entertainment.",9.0
"Colin is a strong and friendly host, his advice was helpful for visiting MONTREAL in 3 days and enjoying the good restaurants. The street is quiet, yet close to an animated neighborhood with restaurants, bars, shops (including the best bakery in the country) and near the Mont Royal metro station. 
We feel at home, the equipment is complete, coffee is provided for breakfast. The room is pleasant, the floor creaks, it's a bit awkward for nighttime movements within the apartment but it seems to be customary in Montreal. 
Our stay was perfect, we thank him again for his hospitality.

"Colin was an amazing, friendly host! He really went above and beyond to make me feel welcome in Montreal, and truly embodies what Airbnb is about—meeting cool, friendly people from all around the world. :) Be sure to check out the recommendations for food and drink in his guidebook as well, all of which were delicious and very reasonably priced. 

The room was just as pictured, and very bright and nice during the day. The location is also wonderful. The apartment is right in the center of Le Plateau, and only a couple of minutes away from the nearest subway station.",9.0
Colin was a great host and we really felt welcomed to stay at his place. The apartment and the neighborhood are lovely.

"The apartment was clean and Collin provided towels, guide books/maps, and our own shelf in the refrigerator. We hardly used the fridge space because we were out and about the whole trip. For that same reason, we didn't talk to Collin much although he seemed like a great guy and gentleman. Reach for the stars! Thanks Collin, our experience was excellent!",9.0
"Collin and his girlfriend were very welcoming and pleasant. The apartment is very nice with a pleasant decor and amenities planned for visitors, very practical.

Endless brunch spots, bars, used book stores, people watching. But... that's not everything. You've got to chat with this guy! He's awesome, easy going, and he will make you feel at home.

We had a great stay at Collin's place (which is really perfect in the trendy and nightlife district of Montreal) and he gave us lots of good tips for shopping and restaurants in Montreal. Thank you so much!,9.0
"The place was great, and it was close to some really sweet bars and restaurants. Colin was really helpful in providing us with excellent places to eat and go out. We didn't have much of a plan coming to Montreal and he was quick to fill us with ideas! His place is cozy so it can feel a little cramped with more than 3 people. The only area to hangout is the kitchen or the bedroom, but if you plan on just using the apartment as a place to crash then it's great! Overall Colin made the experience very nice and I recommend others booking their stay here as long as they are cat friendly!",9.0
"Thanks to Collin's advice, the trip to Montreal was amazing.

His apartment is right next to some bars and restaurants, so you can get anywhere on foot.

The place is close to so many restaurants, bars, and 24-hour quick markets, so you can basically do everything by foot, and there's also a subway station a few blocks away, making it easy to get around town. The bedroom is exactly as pictured. Also, Colin's girlfriend was very friendly and welcoming and she gave me precious tips on where to eat and have some fun in Montreal! I recommend staying there! :)",9.0
"Colin and Melissandre were very kind guests. The arrival process was extremely easy, even though I got there when they weren't home. They were both super welcoming and able to chat about restaurant recommendations as well as tour guide tips. They are fun if you like video games, Netflix or comic books and I feel anyone would feel at home in their place.",9.0
"My friends and I visited Montreal for a weekend and stayed at Colin's apartment. We arrived slightly early and he was very accommodating and kind to us. Though there may be a larger age gap between us, Colin is young at heart and knows how to have a good time. He made some nice recommendations for bars that my friends and I visited. 

He also has a cat and we would have played with her all day! If you're privileged to have the room pictured on the listing, you will have the pleasure of being able to play with her every time you open your door :). The apartment was as beautiful as expected, and I couldn't have enjoyed it any more.",9.0
"It was a very good and pleasant experience. The apartment is exactly as pictured, very cozy and comfortable.

The apartment is very well located, the neighborhood is quiet and safe, the metro is a few blocks away from the apartment as well as the bus, its location is very accessible. Highly recommended the guide Colín gave us to explore the best places!",9.0
"I really appreciate Mel and Colin's openness with me. The food and kitchen were lovely and delicious. Their apartment's location was awesome, surrounded by the best bakery, cheesecakes, and other cuisine. They are truly open-minded and brilliant people who know how to enjoy life. Definitely recommended! You will gain more than just one tour. I thought I disliked Montreal but then I'm loving it:D",9.0

Totally recommended :-)",9.0
"Awesome location. Hosts were ready and willing to help with any advice.  As is typical in Canada, there's no AC but hosts were ready with a fan. I would stay here again.",9.0
"If you are welcomed by Colin, you will have the chance to meet a very friendly and open couple eager to exchange. The room is such as the photograph suggests, pleasant and comfortable. The location is ideal for experiencing the dynamism of a city like Montreal where it's good to live. Located within walking distance of the ""Mont-Royal"" station, which in turn is located at a station on ""Berri-UQAM"", a synergetic center of the city, you will be able to move around quickly. In the end, the accommodation as well as the city should delight you.",9.0
"Collin and Mel were such friendly and attentive hosts!

Before my arrival, he texted me to explain how to get the keys, but when I arrived, Mel was there and gave me some nice tips about the area.

Thank you guys for receiving me!
I hope to see you soon!

"This place was amazing. The hosts were friends and full of advice and information.

The guidebook Colin provided was absolutely perfect, it helped us decide on all our meals.

The location was prime, walking distance to the metro and right in the heart of downtown. A person really doesn't need a car.",9.0
"As a ""virgin"" Airbnb-er this trip and experience has made me a believer in the whole process! Colin and Mel were beyond amazing and accommodating. I felt like I was staying with friends rather than strangers. They are both beyond friendly and helpful in making your way around the city :) The flat is in a beautiful area of the city, surrounded by cafes and boutiques. All the rest of the hustle and bustle is within walking distance or biking distance, as I opted for. There is a bixi bike stand just around the corner from Colin's place and this made it super convenient to come and go. The room and bathroom were clean!! This was a huge test for me...and I was grateful for the cleanliness factor. The apartment was hot while I was there (outside temp of +37 with the humidity) but there is a fan in the room which allowed me to sleep well at night.  I suggest ear plugs if you are a light sleeper, I go everywhere with mine, but I know I would have struggled with the outdoor traffic and creeky floors if I didn't have them :)

I couldn't have asked for a better experience, thanks you guys!",9.0
"It was a great experience staying with Colin and Mel. Everything went smoothly and everything was very relaxed. Colin and Mel were always very friendly and helpful, though unfortunately I didn't get the chance to really get to know them properly since I was always busy myself and spent most of my time outside the apartment. Furthermore, I have to point out that the location of the apartment is very nice. The next Metro station is less than 5 minutes walking distance and you can reach virtually any place in the city within less than 30 minutes.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in Montreal.",9.0
"Colin and Mel were excellent hosts and this place was a really great value! The location is perfect and close to many shops and eateries as well as centrally located for many Montreal attractions. The flat is exactly how it is described in the post and their cat, Chipie, is adorable and very friendly. When we arrived, Colin drew us a map of some great local spots to check out in the area and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely recommend staying here.",9.0
"The stay at Colon's apartment was wonderful. He was always very quick to answer my questions and provided all the info that we need for our arrival. We stayed there for 3 nights and felt very comfortable there. The place itself is beautiful, lots of light and very nicely decorated. The bed was very comfy and the room more than big enough for two. The bathroom was very big and with a window. The apartment's location is great. Just off Mont Royal with lots of places to eat and shop and the metro is just a few blocks down. 

Colin and his girlfriend were extremely welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. They provided us with an extra duvet on very short notice and even though we didn't see them a lot due to their busy schedule they were always open to a little chat and asked how our day was and if there was anything we needed.

This place is really awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone who visits Montreal.",9.0

"This was our first time using Airbnb - and Collin and Mel ensured that it will be the first of many! Collin was very prompt with messages even before we booked. When we got in, both him and lovely Mel were there to check us in. They are such warm and wonderful people - they helped us with our bags (even though they didn't have to!), gave us so many incredible local tips (Collin is a chef, both he and Mel love cooking, so these guys know the real deal when it comes to food) and let us use their kitchen to make chai and generously told us we could use their Nespresso coffees and teas. The photos of the room and space on Airbnb are accurate - it's nice and cozy, faces a relatively quiet street so you have peace at night, but best of all, it's in a fantastic neighborhood. We loved that it's close to the metro, steps away from one of the best bakeries and excellent restaurants...just a fabulous way to soak Montreal in.

This being our first time, my husband was super nervous about ""staying in someone's home."" But it really felt so much more personal than being in a hotel, especially with their gorgeous ""cloud-like"" cat Chippie! We walked away making friends, these are people we'd love to spend time with over drinks (and we did!). Couldn't have asked for more. Thank you Mel and Collin, you guys made our stay in Montreal super special.",9.0
"Really great location close to lots of shops and restaurants, but the apartment is still quiet so you can get a good rest. Mel was a wonderful host who offered helpful tips for getting around. I recommend staying here if you're looking to experience the best of Montreal's hip side!",9.0
"The space is very close to everything, the neighborhood is fantastic with an incredible bakery just minutes away. The metro is only 5 minutes away so definitely a great location. Collin and Mel were very nice. The only downside is probably just the fact that the walls are very thin. My friend ended up feeling really sick from something she had, so the walls were thin that the whole apartment could hear that she was unwell. But other than that, the space was incredible and the location was great. A really solid choice for discovering real Montreal.",9.0

The room is very pleasant and faithful to the description. The location of the apartment is really ideal: two steps from St Laurent Blvd and St Denis street and the Mont Royal metro station. There are plenty of small shops nearby: supermarket, bakery, pharmacy... 

In conclusion, I would recommend staying with them, you will be very well received!",9.0

Great place with a spectacular view of Montreal! Definitely recommend!,9.0
"I cannot review the property because this host cancelled my reservation just before my visit. She magically had another property available at twice the price. This was during the F1 race, so I was essentially stuck as the city had no vacancy given the 10-day notice. This is my first host failure with Airbnb. I was also disappointed that Airbnb provided no resolution for this issue. So I am not sure what to expect from other renters of this host. Possibly there was a real issue with the apartment that was identified 10 days before my visit but could not be fixed by my arrival or they realized they rented it to me at too cheap a price and cancelled the reservation knowing I would be stuck.",9.0
"Stay perfectly on the 26th floor in Montreal!

"This was my first Airbnb experience and Noussa was very helpful. Not only was checking in easy, she was willing to work with our schedule as we were driving in and had unexpected delays. When we checked in, she gave us a thorough walkthrough of everything from parking to checking out at the end of our stay. Additionally, she gave us suggestions on things to check out in Montreal. She was also very easy to contact, and was always willing to help out, as the case when we came back one day to find out someone had mistakenly taken our parking spot. She was very quick in finding a solution and we didn't have to worry about parking anywhere else since parking downtown can be expensive. 

Overall, a very good experience.",9.0
"Great location. Everything is within walking distance. We parked the car for all four days and walked or used the Metro. Communication was excellent with Noussa. We had 4 adults in the condo, a little tight with only one bathroom. The condo was great, the gym was excellent and the outdoor common space was nice.",9.0
SUPERBE APARTMENT!! The host is really nice. The apartment is luxurious and fully equipped. I recommend it to everyone. The building is beautiful.,9.0
"Had a fantastic time in Montreal! The location is perfect, right in the center of everything. We just parked our car and walked everywhere. It was great to have access to the pool and relax after so much walking. Noussa was an amazing host, easy to communicate with and really accommodating! The place was incredibly clean, which is saying a lot coming from me since I'm a clean freak. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal.",9.0
"Great location, close to shops, restaurants, and the metro. The apartment was clean, spacious, and having a 26th-floor view provided good city views. The second bed was a pull-down bed that was curtained off rather than being in a separate room but worked out OK for us. The building had great amenities, although the spa was closed during our visit; however, we enjoyed the outdoor pool and would have used the BBQ if we had stayed longer!",9.0

"The apartment is very centrally located and convenient. The host was very friendly and easy to communicate with. However, the unit is smaller than the photos depicted and not exactly a 2-bedroom as advertised. Also, the master bedroom only had sheer curtains to block any daylight after 6 am.",9.0
"Never felt so welcome before, this Airbnb was amazing. I stayed for 3 days, it was very spacious and the location was really awesome. I had a great time! I ever lost one of the house keys in the elevator and panicked but Noussa saved me with a spare at the right time! Communication was great; she would reply instantly and make sure I had everything I needed! She went above and beyond! Cleanliness 100% dust-free, it looks like it was never lived in before and also HUGE balcony and awesome view! Thanks Noussa! Looking forward to coming back soon.",9.0

"Very nice contact - the location is extraordinary - we were right in the middle of things - the teenagers enjoyed the gym and we had Chilean steak and wonderful views. Who can cook their steak on the 10th floor with a view over the city?

The Old Town is easily accessible by metro, station under the house. We will definitely come back.",9.0
"The location of the condo was amazing! The condo itself was also beautiful. However, we were a bit disappointed when it said it came with three beds and only two were available on arrival. Thankfully, she kindly brought the other one but we spent some time looking for it! Also, there was unfortunately not enough toilet paper to last out a three-day stay! There was also some confusion with the parking; there is no free parking available which was disappointing. Despite all this, I would still recommend staying here.",9.0
"Our hosts welcomed us effectively, proving to be accommodating (particularly regarding our departure time, parking...). They remain discreet. 

We appreciated the apartment, which is new, even though one of the two bedrooms is only closed by a curtain. The building with its communal facilities (we enjoyed the pool, barbecues on the terrace, gym...), its location near the city center, shops, restaurants, and the art museum...

We had an excellent stay and we are much more than satisfied.

The building is very luxurious, modern and has a lot of amenities. The parking lot is clean and well spaced, we left our car there and were able to explore the city by foot and public transit.

The beds are very comfortable and our travel crib fit in the main bedroom. It was also convenient to have the parking (which Noussa is very clear about in the ad that it's $25 per day), because parking downtown overnight for five days is not easy. The building is very modern and new, and there is a grocery store right next door. Noussa is a great host!",9.0

Wouldn't recommend this space due to inaccurate listing description.,9.0
"Their descriptions and photos don't do them justice! What they don't say in the description is that this isn't just a place to stay, but by far an amazing overall experience! Thomas (Nicky's assistant) was available at all times and gave us a lot of recommendations for places to go. But, that's not all... They are the managers at Thursday's and suggested we should go there for dinner, drinks, and dancing. Little did we know that free shots were included (and really good ones, actually)! And Thomas is so energetic and nice that he made us feel super comfortable with our stay and definitely made an impression of how awesome Montreal and its people are. The apartment was spotless and gorgeous, although we didn't spend much time in the apartment because we were too busy exploring Montreal because of the apartment's fantastic location. It is about 15 minutes walking distance to all the restaurants, bars and shops, and the subway is about 5 minutes walking distance as well. When I go back to Montreal, I am definitely staying here again. I definitely recommend this place.",10.0

"What I loved: 

- Nicky and his friend Mike are trustworthy, helpful, and reliable
- The size was fantastic as well as the layout. 
- The kitchen amenities and cooking utensils available were more than expected. 
- The Metro (grocery store) was only 5 minutes away (by walking) and had so many great food items for cooking or ready-made meals, and the prices were reasonable. 
- The shower had great water pressure. 
- Tap water was safe to drink and use for anything 
- The neighbors were quiet and polite, and the neighborhood was safe with plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. 
- Netflix was a huge bonus!

Good to know: 

- The bedrooms have everything you need, but don't have clocks, so use your cellphone or whatever as an alarm clock 
- The air-conditioning unit is hooked up in the living room. So, if you want your bedroom cool, use the 2 fans that Nicky provides. 
- It's better to park your car and leave it at Nicky's to roam the city by foot or transit. The traffic is pretty heavy and it's hard to find parking in Montreal. You'll actually be faster and less stressed on foot or transit.",10.0

The Montreal Metro is a short walk away, getting you to anywhere. There's a good supermarket and a gourmet grocery store within a five-minute walk. After each busy day touring in Montreal with our grandson, the apartment was a great place to settle down. We cooked a couple of nights and the kitchen is really well equipped. Highly recommended.

"This is a great place to stay while you're in Montreal. The host, Nicky, was very responsive, very helpful and has set up a beautiful apartment. 

Having a parking space is a huge plus. Being four blocks from Saint Catherine Street, and three blocks from Grey Nuns, which is where my son has his dorm while he's at Concordia was perfect. The kitchen is really quite handsome and everything was sparkling clean. 

The master bed was much more comfortable than I was expecting. We didn’t use the second room so I can’t say how that bed is but if it’s anything like the first one, you’ll be happy. The bathroom is spacious and refined. 

We will definitely be staying here the next time we come up to visit our son, so you better book early :-)",10.0

It was the perfect location -- a nice stroll to Old Montreal, to the heart of the downtown area and to the Bell Centre where we took in a concert. The walk to the Bell Centre is no more than 10 minutes -- perfectly convenient for our needs. Nicky's place is great. Communication and check-in was an excellent experience -- easy and fast. The apartment was spotless and the kitchen well-appointed with everything one requires to prepare meals. The air conditioning was a blessing, particularly the one in the bedroom, which made for comfortable sleeping. The patio was also a nice feature. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at Nicky's place and would certainly stay there again! Thanks, Nicky!",10.0

Old Montreal, the Underground and the Golden Mile of Rue Saint-Catherine (shopping) are within easy walking distance. Otherwise, bus and metro service are steps away. The master bedroom is comfortable. There is a washer and dryer. A full kitchen and dishwasher for those who cook. Internet speed is great (40mb down, 15 mb up). Apple TV attached to a larger screen has Netflix. Two comfortable couches. The neighborhood feels safe even at night. Note that you are downtown so expect traffic noise. Highly recommended.",10.0

The location was great - in a quieter area but still within walking distance to both subway lines as well as many amazing restaurants (for both budget-friendly options and fine dining experiences). We got some much-needed R&R on our vacation, too, from both the large, comfy bed and the great living room setup (large TV, great sound system, lots of couch space).

"My friends and I (3 total) stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days. The location is really great - a block away from the metro and near some really great restaurants, pharmacies, coffee shops, and shopping districts. We arrived about 10 minutes early while the place was still being cleaned out, but we were able to meet YJ who is really very sweet. There was some confusion about parking and I would ask for clearer directions to the garage. YJ did have to return to show us the exact garage, but I am so grateful for her willingness to help her guests. The apartment itself was small, cozy, and clean. It's identical to what you see in the photos. Free Netflix, internet access, toiletries, all the amenities you'd really need on a short vacation.

"It is a simple, no-frills accommodation in a good location. Free easy parking is a plus, very close to public transportation. Fast wifi. The bathroom needs renovation and a few hooks to hang towels on. The kitchen is well equipped, did not find the cutting board though. I would say it is a decent accommodation for those who travel on budget by car. Do not expect a local, home-like experience: it's a rent-only apartment and we never met the host. However, all our requests were met and the response was fast and informative. Thank you Yj and Sebastien!",9.0

"I really liked staying in the apartment. It was very clean and had all the necessary kitchen utensils. The bed and bedding were of good quality.

- Free parking is a major perk 
- Not fancy, but extremely clean with all the necessary amenities",9.0
"Good location, parking is available, reservations and check-in went smoothly, exactly as advertised, consistent with the reviews' expectations.",9.0
"The location is good and close to restaurants, shops, and amenities. There's a college nearby, making it a lively area, but we didn't have any issues sleeping at night or anything. The garage parking is a plus (with in-and-out privileges) if you drive or have a rental car. Check-in and check-out was easy and straightforward. We had a little trouble opening the master lock, but eventually got it open. Sebastian was very responsive, friendly, and helpful with any issues or questions. He responded quickly to all of our inquiries. If anything, the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, but overall, the place is just as described in the listing and photos. I would recommend staying here.",9.0
"We stayed at Sebastian/Yj's place for 3 nights and it was great. He was very responsive and had some great suggestions for things to do in town. We ate at Kampai (shrimp tacos to die for) and spent most of our time in the Old Towne and at the Just For Laughs festival.

Location is great; Bixi bikes abound, and everything is in walking distance. CRV DOES fit in the garage, but I wouldn't go any bigger than that! :)

The flat is nice and clean and well equipped. Bathroom a little dated, but who cares when you are out and about!!  I would stay again if we head back that way.",9.0
"Great location, a short walk from the Bell Centre. Parking is a bit cramped but manageable.",9.0
"Clean. Parking and WiFi are a plus. Located in a financial district, it's a 25-minute walk to the nearest historical sites and a 10-minute Uber ride away.",9.0
"It was really convenient being able to park our car in the garage. We were like that the apartment had a lot of light and was simple. It was situated close enough to downtown that we could walk everywhere.  The Superette was right downstairs for getting milk and coffee, etc. 

For our part, we didn't mind not having any contact with Sebastian during our stay. We came and went as we pleased. We didn't need to call him for anything. We found most of what we needed in the apartment except for a bathmat and a cutting board. 

The only thing I wouldn't really make note of is the state of the bathroom. While it was impeccably clean and painted white, it was very much dated. The grout was moldy and the wall was peeling from humidity. There was no working vent in the bathroom. The sink drain stopped up systematically, several minutes to drain after brushing teeth.  The water pressure in the shower was OK, but again I only used the hot water. I thought that it was warm, comfortable. 

The mattress was extremely firm. The pillows were very high. That's all personal taste. The couch, however, I was very uncomfortable even for tonight to sit on. 

Still, we are very happy we stayed there and would go back again because it was very clean and well located with a parking garage. 

Not Sebastian's mom died soon as you get off the elevator on the fifth floor, you are overcome by the smell of cigarettes. A neighbor no doubt.",9.0
Very clean place and the host was very helpful. Had a great experience!,9.0
"Great location! Right by the subway and near all the restaurants. The building is an older building and so it had a bit of a stench throughout the halls and into the room. Thankfully there was an air purifier/AC in the bedroom that cleared it up. The bathroom was decent but definitely rough around the edges. Was pleased that Sebastien had very clear and easy instructions on how to check in and check out. The wifi wasn't working during our trip but we weren't home enough to really be concerned. Underground parking is a great addition to this place. Just be aware that the parking lot is a bit dirty. Overall, great place for a great price!",9.0
"This was my first Airbnb experience and I can say with confidence that this is the best place to stay at when visiting Montreal. The place was very clean, as shown in pictures. It actually looks even more beautiful and clean in reality than the pictures. Check-in was very easy, just had to follow the instructions. Since I drove to this place so the best part was the place had parking too, which is otherwise very difficult to find in Montreal's downtown area. The place is only a few steps away from the Metro station and from Saint Catherine Street (very lively at night, especially on weekends). Mont Royal Park is also very close by, so no need for driving to it. The Fine Arts Museum is nearby too.

Overall, we had an ultimate experience and our stay was very smooth and relaxing. 

We would definitely stay at this place only whenever we plan to revisit the city in the future. 

Also, our host Sebastian was very helpful in promptly replying to our queries and helping us with suggestions for places to see in the city.",9.0

"Sebastian was an excellent host and we had a lovely time during our stay in Montreal. He was very clear with his check-in and check-out instructions before our trip. The apartment also came with Netflix, which was great on a rainy day. Overall, the place was clean, and the bedroom was especially neat. The bathroom could use some renovations and upkeep as it was a bit old/well worn. The building itself is older and near a lot of universities, so it could get loud/rowdy at night. Thank you again for hosting us! We hope to be back in Montreal again.",9.0
"Beautiful apartment in an excellent location for exploring Montreal. Obviously recently renovated, very clean and modern. The only real downside is the bathroom which is quite dated in decor (plus the shower isn't the best). Considering value for money, however, the apartment was excellent and we would happily stay again.",9.0
"We had a great stay in this apartment. It's in a good location close to the metro, supermarket, pharmacy, and many restaurants, and check-in and out was easy. We ended up with a large car rental which was a squeeze to get into the garage but we managed with patience!",9.0

"The host was a very nice person, but you can't really see in the pictures that the bathroom is pretty old and the walls are feeling off. The window in the bedroom cannot be closed until the end so you can hear noises or feel the cold. The bed was broken too. But the host was very helpful and brought us an air mattress. Netflix was amazing",9.0
"The host was quick to respond, helpful, and patient. 

The place looked exactly like the photos and was exceptionally clean. Parking in the building was very convenient.

Amenities were minimal and only air conditioning was available in the bedroom.

The neighborhood wasn't ideal (loud partygoers walking home at 3 am, etc.).

Overall, a positive experience.",9.0
"Overall, it was a great stay. When we first arrived, we were greeted by a homeless man sleeping under the phone box, which didn't make for the best first impression. However, the apartment was nice and close to downtown, and you can't beat the price given that parking is included. Sebastian was super helpful during check-in, allowing us to check in after 11pm. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. At night, the bedroom was a little noisy (neighbors, outside noises, etc.), but with its proximity to downtown, some of that is to be expected. Definitely worth the stay if you're visiting Montreal.",9.0

"This is a very convenient and great place in downtown Montreal near Concordia University. I had to help my daughter move out of her university residence, which was just a few blocks away. The underground parking and the elevator made it very easy to carry things to the apartment. The location is perfect. Pharmacie Jean Coutu, PA Supermarket, banks, restaurants, Dollarama and shops are one or two blocks away. The metro is just one block down the street. The apartment is very welcoming, cozy and has everything that you need. The TV has access to Netflix. I would definitely stay there again.",9.0
"The apartment was nicer than I expected. It is close to tons of great restaurants and milk tea shops. You can walk to downtown shopping malls. However, the bathroom was kind of outdated. Some plugs did not work, as did air circulation. The garage looks sketchy but worked. Overall, I would say it's a very good place to stay, especially if you don't drive.",9.0
Amazing place to stay! Very close to restaurants and shops! Highly recommend.,9.0

"The place is very clean and spacious. Only the bathroom needed renovation (to match the rest of the apartment) but everything worked well, no problems. Everything essential was provided. It's a nice comfortable space. I only had problems with parking at the beginning (check-in). A key fob is needed to enter the parking garage. So you need to find temporary street parking to go upstairs to get the key, so that you can go back downstairs to enter the parking garage. When leaving (checking-out), you also need to use the same key to exit the parking garage. Once you're out, you need to find temporary street parking once again so that you can enter the apartment and place all the keys where you first got them.",9.0
"Good location, super close to train and bike share stations, lots of Asian restaurant options around the corner, parking is very helpful. Check-in directions were detailed and had no problems. Wifi was fast and had no problems. Consistent with other reviews, the bathroom needs a lot of care and repair, the futon in the living room is uncomfortable. We came during the major heat wave so the AC unit in the bedroom (only) was helpful but only so much you can do with 100F heat. Lighter and cotton bedding would be helpful in summer time, otherwise the bed is comfortable.  It has the basics, we enjoy making breakfast in so having use of the kitchen was great.",9.0
"The place is quite clean, comfortable as shown in the photos and centrally located in downtown. 
The check-in process is a bit complicated with lengthy instructions for first retrieving keys and then finding parking. Be prepared to dedicate extra 15-20 minutes for check-in.",9.0
"The location was perfect as we come to Montreal annually and enjoy walking throughout the city. Even though we walk, it's located very close to the Metro. The loft was very clean and we really appreciated the A/C. I know it rarely gets hot and humid, but it was when we were there so that was a lifesaver! Everything you need if you decide to eat in and cook. We eat out a lot, however, loved that we could make coffee in the morning which was provided. Overall, great experience. Easy check-in and parking. As with most Montreal lofts, parking is very tight, but my Toyota Rav4 had no issues getting in and out.",9.0
Small but well-located place in Montreal that included [website hidden by Airbnb] was perfect for our short visit to Montreal.,9.0
"The living space at Yj's place is very modern, with tons of natural light coming through the windows! The bathroom/kitchen are a bit less polished, but if you will be eating out more anyway this shouldn't be a concern. The location is undeniably great, being in the heart of downtown Montreal, minutes away by walking from McGill/Concorde, shopping, eating, and across the street from a Metro Station. Very convenient stay for us to explore downtown Montreal.",9.0
"Great location, but with many issues: inadequate air conditioning, subpar bedding, a dangerous garage door nearly destroyed our car, and outdated bathrooms and kitchens.",9.0
"Overall, we had a good stay at this apartment. It was well-equipped with everything we needed, even an A/C unit in the bedroom (very necessary in the summer!) and Netflix on the TV. The host was great with communicating with us, especially giving us a heads up that the parking garage ceilings are quite low (we double-checked the height of our car before leaving to be on the safe side!). The apartment was very clean, although the bathroom is quite old and slightly run-down.",9.0
Do not be misled by the advertisements for this location; you will lose your money and ruin your vacation!,9.0
"We loved this apartment as a young couple, it was the perfect location close to bars and restaurants! The only issue we had was parking our truck, but if you have a regular car, you will have no problem! Overall everything was perfect, the host was very helpful and kind! We’d definitely stay here again.",9.0
"Good value, nice balcony, great location! 
Missing some window blinds, with another high-rise apartment building across the street, it makes for a less than private stay. No A/C probably not a problem most of the time, but another story on a hot day.",9.0
"The website would say their place is just okay. You're basically paying for the location near the train station. The area was a bit seedy and there were multiple directions to get the keys and where to park. I thought I was on a treasure hunt which sounds fun, but after 5 hours of driving, it's not.  The website is as described. The apartment is very small and stuffy. The portable air conditioner was basically a fan since it was over 80 degrees in the city and the bathroom was from the 1980s. Lastly, the garage was one-way so there was a lot of maneuvering to get in and out.  The main issue we had was they forgot to give us a key to the building so we had to buzz in every time. When we were leaving my partner got stuck in the lobby and had to wait for someone to let him in. When the company that owns these Airbnb's sent me their automated texts reminding me to check out. I messaged back about the key and they ""politely reminded me that they had already mentioned that I could just buzz in until 2 am."" They gave us a list of directions to have us check ourselves in without being greeted, the least they could do is provide us with keys.",9.0
nice place :),9.0

Very good communication 

A few issues that need to be addressed and once taken care of, I would consider returning.",9.0
Good value and nice furnishings. Great location.,9.0
"The building isn't great, but the apartment itself is okay. Good location and free parking. Very communicative host. Smelly like smoke in the apartment, but I think that's because of the neighboring apartments. Not a great deal, but it worked out okay.",9.0
"The accommodation is well-located and complete. However, it is quite low on the floor, so you will have to endure noise from bins for over 30 minutes in the morning. 
The accommodation is dirty with broken equipment; we had to throw our socks away at the end of our stay...",9.0
"I can't speak more highly of this place. First and foremost, the host is wonderful! He always checked in to see how we were doing and was so quick to respond to any questions we might have had throughout our stay.

This is a great listing for semi-long tourism and working travelers. Filomena's place is very clean and well equipped.

"Superb apartment in a very beautiful neighborhood. 
Immaculate cleanliness and exceptional bedding!
You feel like ""at home""",9.0
"Nice place. Lots of light. Old charm also means squeaky floors both in the unit and with the upstairs neighbors. This woke me up quite a bit. 

Also could not access the TV with my Netflix account. It seems it is not connected to the internet, and we did not have a laptop, and there are no other options.

Nice touches like tea and coffee and chargers. Amazing location!",9.0

"Let me start by saying the pictures do not do this loft justice!! The loft is huge and was so comfortable for my family and me. The hosts provided my family with THE BEST recommendations, which gave us a local perspective that my family really enjoyed!! The apartment is stunning and was extremely clean. The beds were super comfy and had enough privacy for all of us. The location was simply out of this world - you are legitimately in the heart of Old Montreal and yet the metro stop was steps away which made it super easy to get to the BELL Center for a hockey game! Everything was perfect from start to finish. It has been the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! My family and I thank you Explore MTL!",9.0
"Very pleasant stay, we'll see each other again soon",9.0
"The location is perfect. It's a short walk to many things, especially Old Montreal, and the train station is just around the corner if you want to go further. The hosts were also very helpful and responded quickly to any messages. The apartment itself looked exactly like the pictures and was perfect for relaxing and playing some pool before going out. However, our only flaw was finding parking. There are several lots nearby, but the attendants were never there, so you can only pay for so long in the machine, which required us to wake up at 5am more than once to refill the meter.",9.0
"We really loved the character of this beautiful big loft, somewhat of a hidden treasure considering the unassuming exterior. Perfect location close to everything, plenty of parking and a metro stop 5 minutes away! Pros: It has everything needed to cook yourself dinner, an awesome pool table, wifi was fast and reliable, bedding and towels were clean, there was coffee and a blowdryer. Cons: no chalk for said awesome pool table, can't control the heat (it was really hot!), some utensils/dishes were dirty in drawers when we arrived, hanging your coat requires going to the bathroom, and I swear the upstairs neighbor operates a bowling alley!",9.0
"Visited for one night with two older teens. We loved our hip digs!

The place was spacious and clean. The kids enjoyed shooting some pool during our downtime and making coffee with the Bialetti.

Beds and bedding were comfy and cozy. Great water pressure in the shower. We had everything we needed.

Our hosts were very responsive to our feedback and questions and accommodating to our requests.

"The apartment was great for a guys' trip to Montreal. It is close to everything. Particularly, the Bell Centre is an easy 15-minute walk one way, the old town is an easy 10-minute walk the other way. Very close to the metro and large streets for transit to Rue St Catherine and other areas of the city. Note, however, that it is essentially a 2-bedroom apartment. The couches are not the best for sleeping. The nice modern shapes don't lend themselves to a comfortable sleeping position.",9.0

The loft was clean, decorated nicely, smelled really good, and was comfortable. Thanks Matt and Kaileigh!",9.0

Great location for checking out the old port, walking up to Crescent street pubs/clubs and hopping on the subway line to explore more of the city. Decor made for a really cool experience to stay in with a beer and shoot some pool (not a high-end table but lots of fun). The double bed was a dream to sleep on, and the queen was towards the firm side (if that's your cup of tea). Fantastic place to make a base for exploring all of Montreal has to offer!

"The place was absolutely adorable! Exactly as pictured. A short walk to beautiful restaurants and amazing architecture. The hosts were great too. The apartment was very hot and we had some trouble sleeping despite the extra fans provided. I don't think it was exceptionally warm for Montreal that night, in the 80s, so this is probably not a normal problem. Still good to consider if you're traveling here on hot days. Overall, absolutely wonderful and would definitely stay again.",9.0

"This place was perfect for me and my two young daughters. Location was great. We parked our car in a lot directly across from the loft and didn't touch it for the length of the trip.

A high cleaning fee and then they order you to do most of the cleaning work/prep.
The beds are by the windows so the morning sun will wake you up unless you're used to sleeping through that. Street noise is moderate. 
The place was clean and close to the metro.",9.0
Good place. Accurate with the description,9.0
"This is a terrific location from which to explore Montreal! The apartment is really spacious and comfortable, and is just as pictured. We felt very safe in this neighborhood. And we were very close to everything in Old Montreal. The hosts were super about communicating - they provided plenty of clear instructions up front and were very responsive when we had questions. Their advance instructions also included a lot of area recommendations, and the one recommended restaurant we tried (Olive & Gourmando) was superb. There were minor issues (dishwasher went on the fritz) that did not affect the enjoyment of our stay...stuff like this can happen anywhere. One caveat: if you arrive late (after 11) and park in the lot across the street, you will only be allowed to purchase parking until 5 AM and then will have to return to the lot, at which point you can purchase for a longer stretch (up to 60 hours, as far as I can tell...and we were able to extend after that as well). Everything is very close...you won't need your car.",9.0
Close to all Old Montreal sights and close to Metro,9.0

"Explore MTL made our visit to Montreal a memorable one. We felt comfortable and at home in their space and totally spoiled by their personalized customer service and unique insight of their city (so much better than staying in a hotel!). They went above and beyond for us and we only stayed a night! 

This ""Vieux-Montreal"" loft is spacious, trendy and bright. It's even better than the photos! Creative design, unique decor and eclectic modern furniture - the ideal space for my work vacation with the hubbie. Their home was spotless and well presented when we arrived. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed including complimentary coffee for the mornings and the lovely scented bathroom toiletries were a nice touch. The queen bed was uber comfy (seriously, where did you buy those sheets?!?). The wifi was fast and reliable (which is always important!), they also provided their Netflix account and a portable speaker for us to use. 

The location was prime, located on one of the major streets in the Old Port. Surprisingly no noise from the street carried into the apartment. The loft was a quiet and cool escape from the bustling city outside.

Transportation: soo easy! We parked our car in the lot next to the apartment and opted for bixi bikes and the metro.

The lovely hosts provided amazing recommendations for the entire city (wow) - they're clearly experienced foodies!!! They were always available to answer our (unending stream of) questions, offer helpful suggestions and were just incredible throughout the entire process! The check-in process was made painless with their detailed instruction manual - which was much appreciated after a long day of travel!

Check-out: Easy but hard to leave!

Thanks again for an amazing stay. We will definitely be back!!!",9.0

This place is gorgeous! Close to the old port and great for walking around and checking it out,9.0
"The location was great, right in Old Montreal. Unfortunately, we experienced some issues with our apartment that negatively impacted the experience. We rented the apartment primarily because it was advertised as having a complete kitchen. Upon arrival, we found old food from the previous guest had been left in the fridge by the cleaning staff. The dishwasher was also out of service, which was not mentioned in the listing. We purchased food on our first day of travel and stored it in the refrigerator. The next day, we noticed the refrigerator wasn't cooling properly and were forced to throw out our food. The stove was also not heating properly. Communication with the hosts was good but they were unable to offer any solutions for the appliance problems as they were not present in the country at the time. Overall, while the location was nice, we were disappointed because we chose this property due to the fact it had a kitchen.",9.0
"A very clean, spacious loft. Perfect location in Old Montreal. Just a short walk to restaurants, bars, and all the attractions that Old Montreal has to offer. Definitely will be staying here again!",9.0
"We had a lovely stay, the place looks just like the pictures and the beds are comfortable. This flat is all about location! We walked everywhere! Aaron and Kaileigh were fantastic at being in touch throughout the experience and really made us feel at home. Just a heads up, if you're a light sleeper, bring some ear plugs as you can hear the light murmur of the city at night, something I quite enjoyed, but also the flats above can emit some noise from time to time. Staying in the loft was a lot of fun and perfect for a Montreal getaway. Thanks again Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh!!",9.0
"You would be hard pressed to find anything better in terms of space, location, comfort, and safety.",9.0
Clean. Well-furnished. Felt like home. Would definitely recommend.,9.0
The host was very communicative and provided all the information and amenities for a comfortable stay. They very kindly allowed us to leave our luggage behind to pick up later even after we checked out.,9.0
"What a gem! Kaileigh, Aaron, and Matt are terrific hosts, well organized and readily available. We even received a message part way through our stay to see if there was anything we needed. The loft is gorgeous and well appointed. Exactly as pictured. We were met by Kaileigh when there was an issue with the internet. She offered interim alternatives and solutions and it was fixed the next day.

The neighborhood is great! Old Montreal and its sights are within walking distance, as are restaurants and coffee shops. A short drive to many historic sites, grocery stores, and drugstores. Everything you need is a short distance away. Parking is easily available right in front of or next to the building. Overnight parking is free on the street. 

Thanks for a great stay!",9.0
Great place to stay!,9.0
"Space is amazing. The location is walkable to the metro and there are places to eat. And the hosts are stingy with recommendations on what to do and where to get good food! 

I have to admit parking is tough everywhere. There's street parking at night, but since we didn't use the car, we parked it in one of the suggested lots. 

We were only two, but we agreed the space is perfect for a group! We definitely would use this amazing space again!

P.S. The pub downstairs is great for a late-night bite!",9.0
This place was amazing! I would love to stay here again! It exceeded my expectations and I will definitely try to book here again.,9.0
"Great location and cozy space. We were bummed that the pool table was broken (tilts down on one side so the balls roll all over the place and onto the ground because the baskets are broken). That was one reason for booking the place. The floor up on the loft was dirty, and when I put my pants on, they had been on the ground, covered in dust. It made me question the high cleaning fee. But aside from a couple of downsides, the place was just what we needed for a couple-night stay in Montreal. Easy parking across the street (you can track down the parking attendant and he'll tell you what to do) and easy access into the apartment. Cool layout and nicely decorated. Thanks!",9.0
Beautiful place. Very beautiful evening in the city. We enjoyed the little touches of the hosts. Thank you,9.0
"This is the second time we have booked an Airbnb with Matt, Aaron, and Kaileigh, and we were even more pleased this time around than the first.

This place was absolutely amazing. Great location, great amenities, super clean, everything about it was fantastic. Matt, Aaron, and Kaileigh are always great to deal with. They were in constant communication to make sure that we had all the information we needed. They even went as far as messaging me in the morning to let me know that we would be able to access the place earlier than we originally expected.

I highly recommend booking their place and will definitely do so again in the future.",9.0
"Great house. Great location. The homeowners were available if needed, but not intrusive.",9.0
Perfect place to stay for one night. Beautiful decor and furniture.,9.0
"Just like the photo. Studio type apartment but since space is huge (a lot of space!), the beds were segregated well via leveled floor. It has a bachelor's pad vibe. It’s a walk-up but wasn’t a problem since our stroller was compact. 

It’s close to St Paul street where the shops and restaurants/cafes are located. We also walked going to nearby neighborhoods like Chinatown. 

We enjoyed using the pool table. My 3 year old daughter loved the place.",9.0
"This is the perfect space to experience Montreal loft life. The vibe in the loft was very happy and peaceful. I loved the art on the walls and welcoming notes. A perfect sanctuary after walking around the great city of Montreal.  The sheets on the bed were super soft and there were nice touches of the delicious homemade granola, natural shampoo, conditioner, and soap.   I recommend this place.",9.0
Absolutely amazing place to spend a few days. Amazing location with some of the best-rated restaurants in all of Canada within walking distance. Highly recommend,9.0

"The lift was very spacious and very stylish! Communication with the hosts was extraordinary as they answered very rapidly and always ensured throughout our stay that everything was fine with us.  Also, the beds were really comfortable! I would highly recommend this loft without hesitation!",9.0
"Go to Airbnb in Montreal. Stayed at M, A & K's lofts in the past and each time my expectations were exceeded. They're constantly updating + upgrading their customer service, design + amenities which were already top quality. Since my last visit: they've moved to local + organic bath products (which smell divine), offer homemade granola (which is delicious) & provide aromatherapy lamps (lovely scents add to the relaxing atmosphere). It's obvious they have real pride of ownership, are focused on their guests needs + perfecting their craft. Their customer service + hospitality are unrivaled.

I'll be back!",9.0
"Matt Aaron and Kaileigh were great, very responsive and even ordered new pool cues on my complaint about the state of the current ones! The loft is huge and well located for business or pleasure in downtown Montreal. 10/10 would stay there again.",9.0
"It is a beautiful space in a convenient location! Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh were gracious hosts with excellent communication regarding any questions or issues that arose. We did have a problem with excessive noise one night in an apartment above us but that is not to blame on the hosts. They helped us handle the situation and we were able to resolve it. We really enjoyed our stay and would absolutely recommend this loft!",9.0
Another excellent stay + note that each time there is an addition thought,9.0

Translation: Simply perfect!!!,9.0
"Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh are fantastic hosts who are attentive and available from before the booking to after the stay. The loft is absolutely gorgeous and nostalgic. The space is much larger than what you would expect from the photos; guaranteed to make your mouth drop the second you walk in. A beautiful open concept, great location, and quite accessible for parking (street parking at $8/day). Cozy and stylish, perfect for entertaining a small group. Highly recommended for your next stay; it will make your visit to Montreal exceptional.",9.0

"Gorgeous place with large windows. Had a great time playing pool and relaxing for the weekend. I'm a frequent Airbnb user and this was one of my best experiences.

"We spent 48 hours with our children at Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh's place, and we absolutely loved our stay! The apartment is clean, super cool, and well-located.

Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh also shared their good addresses, which was awesome when discovering Montreal. Thanks!",9.0

It's within walking distance to many great restaurants, close to the metro, we enjoyed our time here and will stay here again on our next visit to the area. Very quick response to any questions, plus the hosts are very pleasant!",9.0
"Great space, great location. Spent a few days in Montreal for a couples getaway and the loft was big, bright, warm (it was cold outside) and well appointed. We walked to a Habs game (10 mins) and old Montreal is just blocks away. An outdoor parking lot across the street was convenient and let us pay for all 4 days up front. - $80. McGill street (steps away) had restaurants and a micro-brewery that are great and less touristy than the spots in the heart of the old town. Communication with M-A-K was great.",9.0
Great location to stay and explore Montreal!,9.0
A really amazing loft. So clean and located right in the heart of Montreal. Perfect place to stay if ever you're in town,9.0

"Perfect place for stays in MTL, just a 10-minute walk from everything! In the heart of downtown!",9.0
"Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh's place was exactly as described and their hospitality matched the reviews. I booked this Airbnb based solely on the reviews and was not disappointed. 

My husband and I had a mini honeymoon in Quebec and on our way home from Mandeville we wanted to see if we could extend our trip by a day and spend a night in Montreal (this is how our trip began). Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh were so quick to respond and so kind to accommodate us the same day as our request! 

The location was good with plenty of parking options nearby and it's a short walk to the excitement of downtown Old Montreal! The apartment is beautiful and very spacious in a secure building. The bed was comfortable, but be prepared to hear street noises - which is obviously not the fault of the hosts. 

The place is clean and well-equipped for a great stay in Montreal! We recommend staying at Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh's place! The hosts are so friendly and sweet you won't want to leave.",9.0

"Totally cute and unique apartment, awesome location close to Notre Dame and Square Victoria OACI metro with a Starbucks around the corner, easy parking directly behind the building and super simple check-in process. Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh were extremely responsive to every question prior to and during our stay. We weren’t bothered by the noise from the lively Irish pub directly beneath the apartment since we were exploring most of the day anyhow and the neighborhood/building is super quiet once it closes (11pm weeknights, all day Saturday and Sunday). If I wasn’t traveling with a child, I would have been down there myself!",9.0
"Great stay, the location is perfectly spot on! A+",9.0
Lovely apartment! We enjoyed our time here! Super comfortable beds and a safe location! I would definitely stay here again! :),9.0
"Loved this stylish loft. Old Montreal is the best location to be while in Montreal - shopping, restaurants and cafes. The extra details for guests are lovely and the hosts are very organized & respond quickly. Perfect stay.",9.0
"Beautiful loft located in the area of the old port close to restaurants and nightlife. The loft was stylish and fully equipped. The sofa bed was a bit tricky to unfold and the additional taxes on top of the rental fee made the loft an expensive stay. However, if you have the money, you can treat yourself because it was worth it :)",9.0

Beautiful loft style space in Old Montreal.,9.0
"I have stayed in quite a few Airbnbs over the years, and I feel I really hit the jackpot with this one:

- Hosts: From the welcome pamphlet to the quick communication, it is clear the hosts are really intent on making your stay as pleasant as possible.
- Location: Situated in the Old Port, we were within walking distance of everything we wanted to go.
- Unit: The photos don't quite do justice to the space; it really is quite impressive. It's clear the space was maintained as if it were someone's home. There is a ""wow"" factor when you walk inside.
- Extras: The unit is stacked full of small extras that make you feel right at home (or better), such as environmentally and ethically sourced bath products.",9.0
Thank you for your efficiency and prompt response when we had a little hiccup,9.0

"I had a very comfortable and amazing experience in this very welcoming place.  The prompt communication with Matt, Aaron & Kaileigh was very helpful. The loft is as appealing on the pictures as it is in person. I’m looking forward to coming back and would highly recommend this place! Thanks again.",9.0
"When you first book, they provide you with this immaculate PDF showcasing some of the top places to eat around Montréal, as well as one for getting into the Airbnb/parking. Those were beyond helpful, and I'm sure you'll love them just as much as we did. Definitely a place to spend two nights if you can afford it; one was just not enough time.",9.0
Try to prioritize convenience over fashion. There was no communication from the host's side.,9.0
Super loft for a romantic getaway!,9.0
"What a great spot and location! Loved the decor and the open concept. The pool table was a great addition.  The kids enjoyed playing while the parents took time to relax after taking all the great local activities. The loft includes everything you need, plus personal touches to make it feel very inviting. Great location on the border of downtown Montreal and Old Montreal. I loved walking out the door onto the street and being in the heart of town. The Pub Victoria is a great little local pub that is hopping which is next door. It has a good, little outdoor patio for a pint. Location is perfect (although we did not use the bikes there is a convenient bike rental location (bixi) right out front). The hosts were very quick to respond to inquiries. They offered all kinds of support including a professionally prepared introduction booklet (outlining house rules and need-to-know info) and a separate local activities/dinner suggestion booklet. They are very professional hosts who help to reassure you (as this was one of our first Airbnb experiences). They preempt your needs and provide all the required communications upfront opposed to us asking them for info; they already know what info most travelers are looking for. The only thing to note is upon arrival, the common area which includes hallway and stairs are very dated and not inline with the quality of the loft (yet functional) being a very ""Old Montreal"" building. But once you open the door to the loft, you are relieved. Great experience.",9.0
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this loft. It was exactly as pictured and very comfortable and spacious. It was just what we needed traveling with our two children. All of the required amenities were provided - and then some. We didn’t want for anything.  It was perfect. While we were out sightseeing, the kids would ask when we were going back to the loft. 

The location was great. We were able to walk to all of the areas we wanted to see - Old Montreal, Rue St Catherine, Chinatown, the Port, etc.  This was with no complaints from the kids - a true sign that it was a comfortable walk. When we wanted to venture further out, the Metro was a quick couple of blocks away. 

Aside from place and location, the best part about this rental was our hosts. They were very helpful from the initial booking, responded quickly to any and all questions and were very detailed in their communication. Everything was as they described. Most importantly, they were very gracious. Even when we had a small mishap, they made us feel very much at ease. We have used many vacation home rentals and found our hosts for this unit to be one of the best. 
We highly recommend!",9.0
"We had a great stay at this loft. The place is amazing, spacious and clean. Full of thoughtful touches that made our stay comfortable. The location itself is perfect, close to all attractions in the heart of old Montreal. The experience was better than we expected. Our hosts were quick to respond to all our requests and kindly accommodated all our needs. 

I would highly recommend this loft. It is a bit on the pricier side but well worth the money. 

A big thank you to our hosts who made this amazing experience possible. We look forward to staying here again!",9.0
"Very unique listing in a great location. The building is a bit rundown, but the unit itself is nice. The check-in experience was poor due to an incorrect address on Airbnb, but I'm sure this will be fixed for future guests.",9.0
"This space truly delivers...hands down one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had to date! 

Matt, Aaron and Kaileigh have included so many unique little touches that will truly warm your heart.

The apartment provides the perfect base when spending time in this lovely and vibrant neighborhood; if you are lucky enough to snag this space for your stay in Montreal, you are in for a treat!

You will not be disappointed...",9.0
The New York style apartment I stayed in was very clean and in a prime location.,9.0
"Arriving at this place, we didn't expect it to look so nice. Although we ran into a little situation, it was resolved right away with the help of Kayleigh. She responded very quickly and resolved the situation very professionally and efficiently. Parking was a bit tricky since the one next to the Airbnb only accepted cash and was difficult to operate. We found parking that was a 4-minute walk and was super cheap for 24 hours; we paid about $10.

I would definitely stay here again!",9.0
"This is the first time using Airbnb. I was not sure what to expect but my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. Matt, Aaron and Kayleigh made the whole process seamless. They were in constant communication with us prior to the trip and even during the trip if there was a need. The loft itself was impressive, stylish and comfortable. So much better than a hotel.  Location was wonderful. Old Montreal was more than we expected! Walking distance everywhere! Don’t be intimidated by the immediate surroundings. The loft itself is located above a pub but we never hear anything at all! There is plenty of construction going on nearby but nothing too disturbing . When you enter the loft for the first time it's like entering a new world! Hosts prepared a great food guide. We purchased an MTL passport and saved so much regarding local activities. Can’t say enough! Thank you amazing hosts!",9.0
Great location and good hosts. Figure out parking before you arrive as that's a challenge. Entry is not as great as the loft!,9.0
"Awesome place, Highly recommend!",9.0
Great location and good value.,9.0
"Matt, Aaron, and Kaleigh are very thoughtful, communicate thoroughly, and provide a lot of helpful information about the area, including excellent tips for local restaurants. The loft apartment is very clean, spacious, nicely decorated, and includes a pool table. The location is perfect for visiting Montreal's Old Town, and you can easily access public transportation for other areas. Parking may be a bit difficult because the apartment is in a business area, but we found a good parking lot about two blocks away that is reasonably priced ($11.95 CN per day).",9.0

Great spot! Check-in/check-out was easy. Cool loft apartment with a unique layout.,9.0
"Please note that the unit is located on top of a bar. We were not expecting this at all. Although our hosts had requested via an extremely detailed message not to make noise past 11:00 pm, the band played until midnight and it was extremely loud in the unit. The bar also had music going until about 2:00 am in the morning.

The unit lacked some basic amenities such as wine glasses and a coffee machine (only having a press). There were five of us and as a result, we did not have enough dishes for everyone. 

However, the loft is nice and cozy. It is well located in Old Montreal with many restaurants nearby. We enjoyed the pool table.",9.0

"Great place as described in the photos, although the main door, lobby, and hallway are pretty unappealing, the actual loft is great. Instructions and communication were stellar. Had an issue with the unit being really hot and I was told it's because heating is central to the whole building, which is really odd. The solution was to crack open a window. It actually worked but not really environmentally friendly. Would have been great to have some way of playing music. There's a Roku hooked up to the small TV but no Spotify unfortunately. Overall, we had a great time. The loft and its location are amazing!",9.0

"Great location near Old Montreal with convenient (paid) parking nearby. The apartment is spacious and clean, and the hosts were very responsive. The kitchen is large and relatively well-equipped; there's a nice TV with Netflix available. The interior renovation is somewhat lacking, and the heat could not be moderated except through opening windows and fans; it was uncomfortably warm. The beds are on a raised platform without a railing, which may not be ideal for some guests. We did love Montreal and the neighborhood.",9.0

"Second time staying in one of their places and we love our experience every time. I 100% trust that their homes will be a home away from home as they never disappoint. This apartment was as perfect as the photos. Great location, walking distance to everything in Old Port. Parking was a little difficult as we got there just around midnight and the garages were full. There are a few lots around - parked in one and walked back - no biggie. The hosts are amazing too - great communication every time! Thanks Kaileigh, Matt & Aaron!",9.0

"Our stay at Adelyna's was remarkable. The apartment is clean, furnished with good taste and very warm: 2 leather sofas, a large TV with internet connection and Netflix server, washing machine and dryer, etc... everything you need! We highly recommend this rental. If you want to visit Montreal, there's no hesitation as the apartment is close to all amenities and particularly the Fabre metro station. I would like to emphasize once again the kindness of Adelyna and her family that we had the opportunity to meet. Thank you.",10.0

"We stayed one night at Adelyna's place. The apartment is pretty and rather warm. It was clean and we felt like it had all the necessary amenities. We booked less than 24 hours in advance but everything was well-organized in the apartment. We didn't meet Adelyna in person, but she left us the key at the entrance with a password system that worked perfectly.  A point to note negatively, however, the apartment block as such is dirty and dilapidated. There were cigarette butts on the floor in the stairwell, and we weren't reassured upon arrival. But once inside the apartment, it was okay. Thank you Adelyna for your hospitality!",10.0

"Adelyna was a fantastic host. She was quick to respond and made checking in and out very convenient. The apartment was accommodating, clean, and very spacious. Having access to Apple TV was a great finishing touch to staying in Adelyna's place. Exceeded expectations for the value. 

The apartment is located very close to the highway with ample street parking. It will be very convenient for guests who drive! Keep in mind to respect some of the parking restrictions though. We didn't think much of it and paid the consequences. Overall our trip was great, we will definitely stay at Adelyna's again!",10.0
"Housing located near all public transportation (bus, metro), quiet and close to shops (traditional and fast food restaurants).
And next door to the apartment, you'll find the best poutine restaurant in town (prized at the Montreal Poutine Festival)! 
Adelyna is very friendly, hyper available and not stingy with information about the city.
The only downside is the smells of the FPK located right next door.
The housing was clean and well-maintained... we recommend it for a family stay of up to 4 people and it meets all the necessary family needs.",10.0

"Barbara was an amazing host! She communicated quickly and very clearly. Her place looked absolutely amazing, even better than in the pictures! And it was so clean! We will definitely come back to her place the next time we are in Montreal. Highly recommended! Thanks Barbara! :)",10.0
"The pictures accurately depict the place; for a small apartment, it is surprisingly spacious. The apartment boasts excellent interior design. It doesn't look like it, but the bedroom is an open concept without a wall to close it off, and the door is mostly see-through, so if privacy is important, this might be an issue. 

At night, it can get quite chilly as there isn't central heating; therefore, prepare for cold weather. Another issue I encountered was noise late at night because street parking outside the apartment (which was difficult to secure a spot) led to tow trucks coming around and towing illegally parked vehicles. They usually alert you with loud sirens before actually towing. Then snow plows would follow to clear out large snow banks. This was annoying as it made sleeping difficult. The neighborhood also has many interesting characters.

Apart from that, everything else was good; the keys were easy to access, the apartment had amenities and was clean. Barbara was also very quick to respond to messages. I recommend staying here with friends because of its large space!",10.0

"Barbara was very easy to communicate with and quick with her responses. Upon check-in we had difficulty with the key, as it was getting stuck and wouldn’t open the lock to the front door. (We also got confused as to which door was for her apartment - it's the middle one.) Barbara had already left for her own trip, but she came back, got us in and settled and provided a different key that worked better with the lock. 

My friend and I visited Montreal on a weekend where they were experiencing a heat wave, so not having air conditioning was a bit of a bummer. But the place has two balconies, one in the front and one in the back, so we opened the doors and had fresh air coming in through the apartment which was nice. 

Barbara has done a great job decorating the place. She's an artist, so it makes sense. It's definitely a cute and stylish spot and my friend left with inspiration as to how we may want to decorate our own places! :) 

Thank you again Barbara for letting us stay at your apartment. We loved the pace and would definitely come back. 

Ps. Love your artwork!",10.0
"Barbara's place is stylish, spacious, and very lovely to stay at; we had the whole place to ourselves and check-in/check-out was very easy. Parking was easy to find on the street, and it had everything you need.

We particularly liked how green the apartment was, with a wide array of plants in the living room and kitchen.

It was in a very nice quiet area which was close to nice places to eat and drink. It is also super near a park, which we would have enjoyed in warmer months :)",10.0
"It was a snowy, rainy and gray few days in Montreal but Richard's home was a peaceful respite to the foul weather outside. It was a great place to unwind and relax after my busy days at a wine conference. There was a very homey feel and a lot of charm, sort of the antithesis of slick and modern (which can be a bit soulless). I didn't get a chance to meet Richard but he was very responsive to any questions I had and gave me a warm welcome.",10.0

"My mom and I headed to Montreal for her first visit to the city, and we couldn't have stayed in a more central, well-placed, nicely appointed condo. The location was absolute perfection! The condo itself was so clean and quite spacious. I will say, if you plan to make meals, please bring your own condiments since this condo does not provide them. It does have a fully equipped kitchen though. We came prepared (minus salt and pepper!) but others may not, so just something to keep in mind. I certainly hope to come back again soon, with the husband this time!!",9.0
"Convenient location to visit Montreal. It takes 40 minutes to walk to Old Montreal.  Access to Mount Royal hill is very close (10 minutes walking).  Correct apartment, very good bedding.

"My family of four had a great time in Montreal using this apartment as our base.  The neighborhood has lots of great restaurants, good shopping and convenient access to the metro, Parc du Mont-Royal and McGill.

The apartment itself is as you see in the photos with no surprises. Pereira and Antoine were professional, friendly and helpful.",9.0

"The location is perfect if you want to be downtown, near all amenities and close to bus lines and the metro. I would like to add however that the apartment's comfort level was low. We never wanted to spend any downtime in the apartment. If you are looking for a place solely for sleeping - great option. But if you are looking for a place where you can feel comfortable in the space if you have an hour to relax, I would look elsewhere (the couch was uncomfortable and smelled slightly, the beds were extremely stiff, and the kitchen chairs were also bad enough to require a pillow from the bedroom to aid in comfort). During the evening, outside noise traveled into the bedrooms as if the windows were open, but that was minor considering we were downtown. The place is presented as in the photos, but our main issue was comfort.",9.0

"As we are not from Montreal, a few things came as a surprise due to my assumptions, such as the lack of air conditioning which made for a very warm stay at 30 degrees, and there's no parking available.

The host was very quick to respond to questions, the place is immaculately clean and spacious, and it is reasonably close to two lots of tourist attractions and great restaurants.",9.0

"My daughter and I stayed for four nights at Antoine's Airbnb. We loved the location, the keypad check-in was brilliant; it eliminated the need for keys. We could walk everywhere from this location. The space was exceptionally clean and tidy. The only downside for us was the people who live above this space. While Antoine cannot control this, if you are a light sleeper I would recommend taking earplugs. I slept in the bedroom closest to the front door and didn't notice it as much at night time as my daughter did who was in the other bedroom. Other than that, our stay was perfect.

"Spacious flat. Very clean and Antoine is very friendly and responsive. 
The flat could be better equipped in the kitchen especially where you can find the minimum. No baking dishes for instance making the use of the oven impossible. But if you ask Antoine, he will bring you what you need.

"As I mentioned in another section, it seems the apartment was just put up for rental. All of the furniture and items in the apartment were brand new. There are two bathrooms - one in the common area and one in the master bedroom, which was convenient. Given that the rental was brand new, there was remodeling dust on the floor both in the apartment and on the stairs, which I assume will be cleaned up for renters in the very near future. The wifi is shared with the next-door apartment through a wifi extender, and there were some instances in which it was less than reliable. However, when we reported any issues to Andre he was there immediately to fix them. I've not had a remote Airbnb property manager ever be as attentive and quick to fix issues, so everything that I listed above pales in comparison to Andre's attention to the property.",8.0

There are also restaurants of all types in the adjacent streets (my favorite being the all-you-can-eat sushi ""Sushi Crescent""). The wifi is a bit weak, but it's great to have access to Netflix through the TV. We had trouble finding the keys, so be sure to look for a box with a code attached to the ramp.",8.0
"The location was perfect, being right next to a ton of bars, restaurants, and shops. The main issue we had was with the wifi. It wasn't working the first day, but after mentioning this to Andre, he got it fixed. However, the signal is still very weak as it comes from an extension and wasn't strong enough to use the TV/Roku because these rely on apps and internet. Andre was very responsive, and although we were low on soap/shampoo/conditioner, he did note to get more.",8.0
"The apartment's location is excellent, right in the city center, making it easy to reach attractions. The room is clean and spacious, with all amenities fully equipped as shown in the pictures, thank you Andre! We will definitely come back again. Awesome!",8.0
"Overall, Andre's place was a good experience. He was very attentive and responded within minutes with answers to any questions I had. The location is within walking distance to many restaurants and nightlife.",8.0
This place is nothing like the pictures. The floors are so dirty you can't walk around without socks or shoes otherwise your feet will turn black. The single bed frame is pretty much broken and barely holding the bed up. The sheets had stains on them and also the master bedroom bed is just on the floor. The smell is disgusting. I would not stay at this place again. I would rather be in a one-room hotel than this place. Andre was good at first. Always replied back on time but this place is just a mess. Trust me when I say book elsewhere,8.0
"This apartment is in a great central location, walking distance to shopping and restaurants. Andre was a very helpful host.",8.0
"This is a huge apartment located in the center of Montreal. I rented it for a week because it looked nice in pictures. While the location is perfect (everything is indeed close-by), the apartment needs significant updates.

1) Wifi works from 8 AM to 6 PM. Despite reporting the issue to Andre and his attempts to repair it, nothing was done on either the same day or the following day. Honestly, I had better internet when I was in a poor neighborhood of Mexican suburbs. Absolutely ridiculous for downtown Montreal.
2) Bathrooms are just not appealing. Yes, they work - but I felt disgusting taking a shower there. No soap even to wash my hands!
3) Cleaning was barely done. The floors are dirty (you can see it on your feet when walking - they become dark in 10 steps!). Dishes were not washed. Cups are dirty.
4) The entrance to the apartment is actually really sketchy. The cafe on the first floor is so bizarre, my fiancé was literally afraid to walk into the building! Plus there's a lot of garbage on the street in front. Moreover, once on the stairs, the light barely works - it's really dangerous to go down. Forget it if you have mobility issues.
5) Everything in the apartment is from the cheapest section of IKEA. Literally everything. In one room there is not even a bed, just a mattress on the floor. Not that the furniture/towels are bad, they can hardly be reused for long periods of time.
6) As the windows go to garbage bins and a hotel, one morning I was woken up at 6 AM by a trash-collector's cars - it was really loud and long (approximately 30 minutes).

In short, 3 stars are basically given for the apartment's location. I would never consider staying there again, and I definitely do not recommend it to anyone unless you don't mind sleeping in a sketchy place with dirty showers and kitchen.",8.0
"Andre's apartment was just what we needed for a guys trip to Montreal, the location was perfect, right beside a couple pubs and 3 breweries. If travel needed, you can rent bikes right across the street. The kitchen and living room were big and spacious. There is a small balcony in the master bedroom, which also has a bathroom with a shower, the other two rooms consist of a double bed and a single. Other than that, this place is right downtown Montreal.",8.0
"Great location and great value, the host Andre attended to our needs promptly. It's an older building that could use some upgrades and he seems to be working on them. The beds were new and quite comfortable, and so are the washer and dryer.",8.0
"Fantastic location and a wonderful host. The place lacks air conditioning and has questionable construction throughout. However, it offers great value and I highly recommend it to most people.",8.0
"This is a good location for all of the downtown area, and it will accommodate quite a few people at a modest price.

However, it has an undesirable dark entrance and spartan (if effective) furnishings, no-character Ikea basics. I've left laundry detergent because there was none.",8.0
"Andre's place is literally in the heart of downtown Montreal. It's very close to the shopping street & bunch of restaurants and bars. It's pretty clean and spacious too. My only complaint is that the apartment doesn't have AC, so if they are coming during the hottest days of the year in Montreal like us (35+ Celsius), the apartment would feel a bit hot to stay during the daytime. But, the host does provide a small fan for each bedroom. Overall, combining the location and price, it's still very recommended for groups of people to experience MTL!",8.0
"The place was not very clean, the location was good. The furnishings were poor.",8.0
Apartment suitable for young adults (18-25 years old) with perfect location for nightlife and enjoying the center of Montreal.  The apartment is very spacious but the lack of maintenance and cleaning is obvious.,8.0
"Great location, right next to all the nightlife. This place is above a hookah lounge. If you're looking for fancy, this isn't it, but otherwise it's okay.",8.0
"The apartment is large and centrally located. We came for a conference and it was very practical, accommodating four people at a modest price. The place is not fancy but very practical.",8.0
"The apartment's location is excellent. However, the apartment was not as clean as I would have liked.",8.0
"It's a noisy area with many bars nearby and on weekends you can hear people talking loudly into the early morning. In the mornings we encounter people drunk outside their apartments. 

The location is good because it's in the city center, spacious, and the host responds quickly to messages.",8.0
"The location is fantastic and the apartment is enormous, with everything you'll need for a wonderful time in the city. We had an amazing time staying here.",8.0
You can easily go downtown and the house is great for staying! It's very nice and beautiful~!,8.0
Central location and ample space.,8.0
"We booked the apartment for one week during Formula1 week in Montreal. I did not stay/see the place; the comments of my team (people in total) 

Location:
Was good, central & convenient, area was cool (outside it was a bit dilapidated)
Cleaning = Cleaning and general, is not that it was dirty but sloppy; the fact of not having any cleaning service or new towels during the week should be taken into consideration for future apartment stays.
Easy to access with the codes - no key needed.
WiFi good 
Dave was very kind & quick with answers, we do wish him all the best and thank you for everything.",8.0
"The house is spacious and clean.
Downtown is just nearby, with a number of restaurants and shopping places.
You can even go to Old Montreal in 15 ~ 20 minutes by walk.

"This apartment is very clean, stylish and up-to-date. I highly recommend it. The neighborhood is a lot of fun too - Rue Wellington, two blocks away, is a bustling, gentrifying (but not yet ruined) street with lots of funky small businesses, restaurants etc. Catherine responded to my communications immediately. A wonderful base from which to check out a great city.",9.0
Clean apartment close to a metro station!,9.0
A perfect location for an escape to Montreal. Close to public transport and easy to drive to with plenty of street parking. Very friendly and safe neighborhood. The apartment is better than the photos; large and bright throughout. Shower is like a spa! Bed is really comfy and kitchen is very spacious and easy to cook in. We will definitely return to Catherine's when we come back to fabulous Montreal!,9.0

"A great place close to public transportation. Was able to reach Catherine very easily,",9.0
"This place was absolutely perfect! We were here for the May Long Weekend and it was such a great experience. The place is well equipped with everything you need! The bed is comfy and the place is very modern and beautiful! Transit is close by which makes it easy to get to downtown Montreal. The area it is located in is very friendly and has many places for you to dine or check out! 
It was such a great time and we will definitely try to book Catherine's place again the next time we are booking a trip to Montreal!",9.0
"Thank you so much! Our stay in Montreal was fantastic. Catherine was both very pleasant and there for any questions or help we needed, I stayed at Catherine's apartment with my 10-year-old son and a friend over the Canadian F1 championship weekend. We found the area to be great for both of us and my son; we had great restaurants nearby and parks to walk/play in. Parking was plentiful, and if you were unlucky not to get a space directly outside the apartments, you could find one close by. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Only one thing could make it more comfortable, and that would be AC. They may have been this, but I was unable to locate the controls, but this should not stop you from booking a very nice, beautiful apartment with a very good host.",9.0
Very beautiful apartment in a quiet and well-located location,9.0
Nice flat in a vibrant neighborhood,9.0
"Catherine's place was perfect for my stay in Montreal. The space was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located in the lovely community of Verdun (~20 minutes to downtown Montreal). Communication was efficient and timely, and pretty sparse since everything was easy to locate in the studio. I look forward to staying there again next time I am in town!",9.0
"Having never been to Verdun before, we were unsure of what to expect. We ended up loving the apartment and area and didn't even make it into the city or Old Montreal. There is lots to do and explore on foot and by bike (using the Bixi bike rentals located around the city). We loved a local restaurant just around the corner called Piquillo Bistro. The food is delicious and the owners are extremely friendly. The apartment was the perfect place to finish a long day. The bed is very comfortable and communication with Catherine was very quick. Would definitely come back!",9.0
Great location and space!,9.0
Well-located apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Faithful to the description and very well equipped. Thank you Catherine for her availability.,9.0

The host cancelled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0
"Great apartment in a great location! Steps from a trendy street with all the shops you could need, tons of cafes and restaurants. Two blocks from a great walking/running/biking path along the St. Lawrence River! Three blocks from two metro stations that connect you to the downtown core in minutes. The area is very safe. As a single female, I lived here for just under a month and never felt anxious walking at night. The apartment is beautiful, with lots of modern touches and basic kitchen facilities. Would highly recommend booking this loft - and would book again myself!",9.0

"Horrible horrible experience!! This apt. totally ruined our vacation in Montreal. We had just come from another Airbnb in Quebec City that was just amazing and above expectations and landed in a dirty, small and noisy Airbnb with a host that had no sense of hospitality at all! The floor was sticky, the dishes were still in the dishwasher, the bed was not made and only had 2 pillow covers out of the 4 and they smelled like a sweaty man, there were only 3 small towels that were stained and did not smell fresh and were also located in the kitchen? There was a Nutella pot outside full of cigarettes. You could hear every step and laugh from the neighbors upstairs. Even though this was not unavoidable for the host she should still warn the guests about it. The 2 bar chairs in the pictures were not even there and there were many light bulbs that did not work. So what you saw in the pictures was different in person. There was no closet available to the guest so we had to keep everything in our suitcases which made the apt. even smaller. There was no toaster, water cooker nor a coffee machine. Just essential things!! So we had to literally go out for a cup of coffee. The trash can didn’t even have a bag in it. It was literally walk in clean and tidy up the apt. (That’s not even yours to begin with) before we could actually get some sleep. We left after 3 days instead of staying our full 6 days and only because there were no other Airbnbs available in such a short notice and we had our 3-year-old daughter with us. Otherwise, we would not have minded sleeping in the car, at least the car was clean! We were only refunded €61 out of the €452 even though we only stayed half of the time! It honestly felt like a rip off and scam. When we contacted to host about our complaints and that we were leaving earlier she said she was sorry and that she would contact the cleaning company to see where it went wrong and get back at us with a solution. We never heard from her again!.",9.0
"Upon arriving at this home, all of the garbage was full, and the bedsheets hadn't been washed. Fortunately, this was the only downside to our experience. We contacted the host and received a prompt response. Under the circumstances, the host was extremely apologetic and dealt with the situation well. It seemed to have been a miscommunication with the designated cleaners. 

Despite this, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The pictures are identical to what the place looks like in person. There are several places to eat and shop within walking distance. This place also has a spacious balcony which is especially nice considering the location of the home. Parking is available, however there is one particular day of every week where parking is prohibited from 9:00-11:00 AM. We ended up getting a $62.00 ticket because we were unaware. As long as you pay attention to the signs you will be fine. Overall, we would certainly recommend staying here, and we plan to book this home again in the future.",9.0
"Catherine's Airbnb is the best one I've had the pleasure of staying at! It's neat, clean, totally equipped - better than expected - and located just 5 minutes walking from stores, the metro station, coffee shops, and restaurants. You get to be in one of the loveliest neighborhoods in the city and still only a 10-minute ride by metro or car to reach downtown and the main attractions. Oh, and it's near the St. Lawrence River! Book it and don't hesitate, Catherine is helpful, courteous, and professional.",9.0

He made the stay a smooth experience with any questions sorted right away. He went far and beyond to accommodate any request with great attention to detail. There was an instance where his integrity would come under a test, and let me tell you, the guy is trustworthy. I would definitely stay again and recommend him to anyone!",9.0

"We haven't met Ben in person but he was attentive and present through messages to ensure a smooth arrival at his apartment.  The one-bedroom apartment corresponds well with the photos, it is on the 3rd floor of a large 23-story building, with a pool/sauna and gym on the top floor (to which we have access freely and which are fantastic!). The building is well located, at the foot of Mount Royal and a few meters from the Guy Concordia metro station and Sainte Catherine street. It was a very good experience that we would gladly repeat!

Also, Ben was quick to respond and checked in to make sure everything was going well.",9.0

"Ben's place is convenient for shopping and walking on the West side of Ste Catherine in downtown Montreal. The apartment is clean and parking is easy to access. There are many restaurants nearby, so once you park, it's easy to explore Montreal on foot or by metro. I think the space is better suited for 2 people than for 4 (open concept), but it would be doable if you were 4 friends on a budget.",9.0

"This apartment was perfect for what we were looking for. Not only was it clean, it was well-stocked, and in a great location. The parking spot was an added bonus for us because we drove to Montreal. Ben was a fantastic host who was easy to get in touch with before, during, and after our stay. St. Catherine was a 2-minute walk away and had tons of restaurants and great bars to offer.

Parking was also very convenient. The bed was super comfy too! Ben was a great host and helped out if we had any questions. Would highly recommend!",9.0
"Ben's place is perfect for couples looking for a cozy spot to stay in downtown Montreal. It's clean, quiet, and looks exactly like it does in the pictures. It comes with many amenities, and the Wi-Fi works very well. Ben's place came stocked with soap, shampoo, toilet paper, towels, a hairdryer, and even an ironing machine. The free parking is extremely convenient for guests driving to Montreal; however, I do caution those with taller vehicles (like lifted trucks) since the ceiling of the garage leading to the outdoor lot didn't seem that spacious in height. We were able to park and leave our car in the same spot for the entire duration of our trip while relying on the metro station that is one block away to get around the city. Ben's place is also conveniently located two blocks away from Sainte Catherine Street which has a great variety of shops and restaurants all within walking distance. Ben was very polite and quick to respond to any questions we had. His check-in/check-out instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I would absolutely recommend booking with Ben. Thank you again for the wonderful stay!",9.0
"Great value and great location. Close to Guy-Concordia metro station, convenience stores, SAQ, tons of restaurants, etc. Quiet at night but some traffic noise during the afternoon. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comfortable stay for nearly half the price of an average hotel room. Great communication from the host as well!",9.0
"Ben was really nice and accommodating. Communication was superb. The location was also central and close to a lot of restaurants and essential places. Free parking was also very helpful since street parking is quite expensive and limited. The building is quite old and the other tenants on the floor did not maintain their units so the smell of smoking is very evident. The unit itself is pretty clean so that was good. Overall, good experience. Affordable price with decent stay/unit.",9.0
"Ben's place is nicely located in Montreal in a trendy part of town. Ben's communication throughout was excellent. There are many restaurants and bars within walking distance of his place.

The biggest advantage is that you get secure parking included with your stay, so if you are driving into town definitely great. Thanks for a wonderful stay!",9.0

The AC, though noisy, was great when it worked, although it did cut out all the electricity once, but Ben was on hand immediately to help fix the problem. 

Brilliant location; lovely neighborhood, convenience store in the building, within walking distance of the metro and plenty of restaurants nearby.

Free secure parking on site was a bonus, especially as we relied on public transport after parking up, which was easy to navigate.

A couple of additional touches would make it perfect: a full-length mirror in the room, some lighter bed sheets, and shelves/drawers for unpacking clothes. That being said, it was suitable for our needs.",9.0
"Ben's place is great for those visiting Montreal: walking distance to Bell Center, shopping area, restaurants, and Mount Royal.

"The experience matched the listing perfectly. It's a clean little apartment in a lively neighborhood. We brought a tandem bike with us, and it was stressful because it was too large to fit in the elevator. We couldn't find a bike rack and ended up locking it to the fence behind our parked car. Fortunately, it wasn't stolen from the secure lot, but we were worried about it. Tandem bikes are extra big and heavy. Perhaps a standard bike would have fit in the elevator just fine. The apartment has a balcony, and we could have stored the bike there.",9.0
"Loved staying at Ben's apartment. He was always very quick to respond and we really appreciated his attentiveness. On top of that, his home was quaint and cozy and in a very convenient location! We walked to many different areas from the apartment. Bus stops are nearby as well. It was extremely convenient and comfortable. Ben was extremely helpful in recommending places to visit and even accommodated us arriving a bit earlier so we didn't have to carry our heavy luggage around. Loved visiting Canada and loved being able to stay in this cute apartment. I'd definitely recommend it.",9.0

Kitchen missing many tools
And overpriced for what it is
Instructions were good and adequate, and downtown is easily reachable",9.0

"The place was okay, certainly not great. It would have been nice to have more than an old dish towel in the bathroom to dry our hands, let alone a couple of actual bath towels. The building itself was the real problem; dingy and run down would be the most charitable way to describe it. Falling down construction foam wrap in the elevator, plastic sheeting covering the carpet in the hallway. Not a good look. 

But for us, the real clinker was when we got there, plastered all over the doors and walls were signs saying the water was going to be turned off from 9:00 AM-5:00 PM. Totally unacceptable. The signs were posted the day before, and our host should have known and informed us of this. His response was ""It's not my fault!!"" And yes, that is his actual quote; not something I ever wanted to hear from my kids, and definitely not a response I want from a host.  I called Airbnb, cancelled our next day, and thankfully, was able to get a full refund. 

If you're looking for a budget place to stay, this might be okay as long as there are no other problems with the building. Otherwise, if you are looking for somewhere nice, in my opinion, keep looking.",9.0

"Ben's apartment was perfect. I arrived after midnight. Check-in was flawless. The apartment was clean. The air conditioning was already running. The area is near Concordia College. Lots of younger people. However, it was very quiet during my stay. A close walk to Starbucks and the location of my deposition near the hospital. Uber drivers were waiting for me if needed. Good deal.",9.0
"We loved staying here. This apartment is a basic studio apartment so if you're looking for a luxury stay this is not your place...but for us it was perfect. We just needed a place to crash in Montreal which was one of our stops on a very long road trip we were on. Having off-street parking was a huge plus - we parked our car and didn't have to think about it or look at it for the duration of our stay. This apartment is in a fantastic location and we were able to walk or take the city bike system to every single place we wanted to go - museums, Old Montreal, shopping, and restaurants.",9.0
"Great location and private parking are major pluses for anyone driving. The pillows were very thin, so be sure to bring your own. The rooftop and pool were nice. There was a lot of construction going on throughout the building, but I didn't notice it when inside my room.",9.0
"Thank you for the stay, Ben. The apartment was great.",9.0
"Great location! Walking distance to everything downtown. Ben was very friendly and helpful, highly recommended.",9.0
"Good spot! Great location, responsive host. Exactly as advertised",9.0
"Great location, easy check-in and it was wonderful to have free parking. 
The apartment was okay, it could use a woman's touch.
It is difficult to walk beside the bed without banging your shins but the bed was surprisingly comfortable. Could use some extra pillows though.",9.0
"Nice apartment, as described in the profile. Everything you need is there. Central location. Easy communication with Ben. Good value for money and ideal for a short stay in Montreal.",9.0
Great place in a great location. Nice stylish studio apartment in the downtown area... would definitely stay again! Ben was quick to respond to messages and really helpful.,9.0
"Great location, awesome private parking (as long as you don't have a truck or SUV that is too tall to fit), clean, and great communication from Ben! We would love to visit again!",9.0
"This is a great apartment located just outside of the central shopping district. It's conveniently located to a Metro station to take you wherever you need to go. The instructions to access the apartment are clear, and parking is provided. The only two complaints are that the pillows were pretty much non-existent, and there isn't a remote for the TV, which was only a problem because it was on when we got there, but there are buttons on the side to turn it off and adjust the volume. I would definitely stay again.",9.0
I highly recommend it! Incredible quality-price ratio.,9.0
Nice and easy place to stay. Nothing fancy but great communication with the host and everything was clean and convenient.,9.0
"Ben's apartment was clean (even though some utensils were not from previous renters, I guess). 
Communication with Ben was on point before and during my stay. 
There were lots of noise coming from outside and inside the building (but then again it's Montreal!).
The free parking is really great and easy to find.
This is a wonderful value for being three blocks from Downtown and it was what I was looking for.
I would recommend this apartment!",9.0

"This place is in the perfect location in so many ways. Great bed, nice couch, next to everything! Could easily fit 4 adults. Would stay here again.",9.0
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 days from December 29th to January 2nd. This place is amazing; it's very close to most of Montreal's attractions. For the price, this is a great deal. The subway stop is about a 5-7 minute walk. Everything is within a 5-mile radius. For those planning to visit Montreal during New Year's, EVERYTHING IS CLOSED ON JANUARY 1ST.

The only problem we ran into was that it got a little cold at night, but nothing too unbearable. The entrance to the parking lot is a bit low; my compact SUV antenna kept hitting the top of it. I can't imagine a big truck or SUV fitting through it. Overall, it was great and I would definitely stay here again.",9.0
"Excellent host, very clean, everything was perfect, good communication and very well located, I highly recommend it, thank you so much for your hospitality!",9.0

Beautiful and clean. Would stay again,9.0
"Ben's place is in a fantastic location. It's close to everything and has great amenities and is very secure. I had a wonderful stay and was very comfortable throughout my entire visit. Netflix was available on the TV, and he even had menus for some of the area's restaurants to help make dinner easier. Ben is quick to respond to questions and requests, and if I ever need an apartment in Montreal again, his listings will be the first place I check. Thanks for reading, and have a great time in Montreal.",9.0

"Nice place, but it wasn't clear it was a studio until we arrived. Good location. Decent size for a studio, though. Overall, enjoyed my stay!",9.0
"Ben's place was easy to find, and the free parking is great! The place is clean and located in an accessible area with many restaurants, bars, and museums. He communicated quickly and gave detailed directions on how to check in, and there is a sauna, right enough said. Safe and clean place. Very happy with my stay, will stay here again next time I'm in Montreal.",9.0
"My stay at Ben's apartment was great! It is very well located, near many stores, shopping malls, and supermarkets. The metro station Guy and many bus stations are also close by. Ben always answered me quickly, which I really appreciate. He was also very supportive during my arrival and departure. I definitely recommend his apartment!",9.0
Exactly what the listing states and true to the photos. Ben's place was exactly what we needed for our weekend getaway. Ben was very responsive and made check-in a breeze.,9.0
A nice place to stay in the heart of downtown Montreal,9.0

"Super Stay in Montreal! A very well-located apartment to walk around the whole city, Ben is a very responsive and available host for any help needed. Thanks again, Ben :)",9.0
"Ben answered all of our questions quickly before we arrived. The check-in process was easy. We found that we could walk to many places from the apartment, and we were so close to the metro as well.",9.0
"Ben's place is in a really central location - within walking distance to many restaurants and shops, as well as the metro stop. Even though it's in such a central location, we weren't bothered by any noise. The place has everything you need (kitchen utensils etc.) However, the building is very old and you smell smoke, marijuana, etc. in the hallways. The apartment itself could also have been a little cleaner. The parking spot was good for us, but I can definitely see people with larger cars having trouble even accessing the parking area. We paid roughly 30 €/night for our stay. So overall we were happy with what we got for the price we paid.",9.0
Location was spot on. Walked to everything. Perfect size and parking was super handy. Highly recommend!,9.0
"For those arriving from outside, especially by car and wanting to stay in the city center with included parking that is very easy to access, it's really a great place. It's safe. Everything is nearby, it's truly a practical location. Definitely worth returning to.",9.0
This was my first experience renting with Airbnb and Ben was great at replying to my questions. The place was as expected and was perfect for what we needed. Right around the corner from many restaurants and shops and within a 45 minute walk of most of the main tourist destinations. Thanks Ben!,9.0
Well-located. Swimming pool and sauna accessible. Accommodation rather quiet. Difficult to find parking inside.,9.0
"The place is as described. The parking is the selling point of this Airbnb. If you are traveling alone with a car, you may have to double park for a few minutes while you run up and grab the garage keys and return to your car. Unfortunately, the hallway leading up to the apartment reeked of cigarette smoke 24/7. I understand this is out of the control of the Airbnb host, but if you're sensitive to this smell or have bad asthma, this may be an issue for you. The apt itself kept most of the fumes out. The location was perfect and was walking distance to many great restaurants.",9.0
"Well-located apartment. Close to the metro and Sainte Catherine Street. Ideal for visiting the city. The only complaint I can make concerns the cleaning, as well as the bad odors coming from the hallway.",9.0
"Clean apartment in a great location. Ben was easy to communicate with, and check-in/check-out were extremely easy.",9.0
"Located very well in the middle of Montreal, it's easy to get to all tourist attractions from there. The only big issue was with the parking garage. We couldn't enter it with our car as it was too large. The maximum car height can only be around 1.78m. We had to park a few blocks away and pay extra for it, which wasn't nice because we chose this apartment in the first place because it included parking.",9.0
"Ben is quick to respond and his place is close to the metro. It's also clean! Don't be discouraged if you smell any smoke, it's just from the other units. Just open the window and the scent quickly disappears. I have bad allergies and was concerned about this at first, but it wasn't in any of the linens or couch.",9.0
"Ben's place was exactly what we were looking for. Good area, metro close by, lots of places to eat and drink all within walking distance. Would recommend to anyone!",9.0
"This apartment is in a fantastic location, providing everything you need to visit Montreal. Ben was responsive and the apartment was great. The on-site parking was very convenient too.",9.0
"Very well-located accommodation, close to the metro and several restaurants. Comfortable temperature, comfortable bed. Excellent communication with Ben A. Free parking on site an advantage in this area. Strange odor in the hallway during our stay, but okay in the apartment.",9.0
"The best place! So close to everything, right in downtown, highly recommended! You will love it, we did too!",9.0
"The apartment is basic but clean. Ben was very responsive to all questions. Check-in was easy and the instructions were clear. The parking spot was a huge plus as it can be costly to park if you have to drive everywhere. The apartment is in a great and safe location near the metro, restaurants, and shopping. We walked everywhere. If I'm being picky, investing in little touches would be nice such as better quality towels and higher quality pillows. But as I said, the accommodations were basic - not luxurious. Overall, it was a good and very functional starting point to explore and experience Montreal.",9.0
"Thank you for being such a great host! We really enjoyed staying there, and we really loved Montreal! What a great location it was!",9.0
"This place was just fantastic !!! Ben was an amazing host and did an amazing job communicating. Ben made check-in really easy and did a fantastic job in making sure the place was clean, as well as making sure his guests were comfortable and all the essentials were met. The place was in an amazing location and was extremely close to metro stations. So it wasn’t hard at all to venture out into the city and find your way back. Overall, this place was great and I highly recommend it to any couple who is looking for a nice getaway to Montreal. Ben was an amazing host and you can’t ask for anything better.",9.0
"Ben was an excellent host, particularly in his communication with us. The location of his place is perfect and very convenient for getting around the city! Thank you, Ben!",9.0
"Ben's studio apartment was located in a great location. We were there during the extreme heat and the air conditioner worked perfectly at keeping the space cold. Parking was super easy as the space was a secured outside lot where you could choose your parking spot. 

This is an apartment building. The common areas (hallways, elevators, lobby) are not clean.  The shared laundry rooms, however, are super clean. 

Ben responded quickly to any inquiries we had.",9.0
"The location is great, and the owner was very nice!",9.0
"The apartment was nicely appointed and clean, and the location was amazing. The pool was under maintenance, but Ben reimbursed us when I mentioned it to him.",9.0
"Well located near the metro. Has a basic kitchen. Free parking for a standard car (really big, won't fit). Has a gym, pool and sauna, although the pool was closed for repairs during our stay. Only issue we had was there is a lot of noise coming from the street due to one of the windows being jammed open to fit the air con machine. The next night we could drown out some of that by blasting the air con machine on full, but still not the quietest sleep. Overall it was a good stay.",9.0
"We really enjoyed our stay at Ben's little apartment. It was perfect for my wife and me. The air conditioning was a lifesaver during the Montreal summer heat. The apartment is in a great location, making it easy to explore downtown Montreal on foot or by taking the metro. I also used the gym, which was a nice touch. There were a couple of spots where the cleaning was overlooked in the kitchen, but it was no big deal for us. Ben is super quick to respond to messages and check-in was easy. 

We would gladly stay here again.",9.0
"My husband and I stayed in Ben's apartment downtown Montreal for 3 nights and we were happy with the location and the free parking. Ben was very responsive and provided clear, detailed instructions for check-in/check-out, parking, and building amenities. The apartment is close to shops, restaurants, and public transportation. It's also within walking distance of the biggest park in Montreal (Mont-Royal), which was a bonus. The neighborhood seemed safe; however, it gets very noisy on weekends!  It seems like many college students live in this area, which is fine, but they can be extremely noisy in the building, hallways, and on the street until late at night. The walls and windows in the building didn't seem to be very insulated, so there was also a great deal of very loud street noise (cars, motorcycles, trucks, people shouting, etc.).

The apartment itself is no-frills, but it suited our purposes for a few days. Since we stayed in the summer, we especially appreciated the air conditioning. The bathroom needs some TLC, but was functional. I believe the bed was listed as a queen-size, but I think it's one of the Ikea brand full/queen beds, and it definitely didn't seem as large as our queen-sized bed at home. The kitchen was well-stocked with dishes, glasses, etc., and has a full-size refrigerator. Like other reviewers mentioned, we experienced the smell of smoke in the hallway outside the apartment, but had no problem inside the flat itself. The elevators worked well and were big enough for my husband's mountain bike. Overall, the free parking and the location of this apartment outweighed the noise and the lack of fancy amenities. I would recommend Ben's apartment.",9.0
"Easy check-in, parking and amenities are big pluses for the price",9.0
"Ideal location for visiting Montreal, close to all amenities, clean and conforming to the host's description. I recommend it!",9.0
"Ben's place is in a perfect location to enjoy the city of Montreal. It was great that it had parking and we fully enjoyed our stay. It's a great Airbnb if you plan on being out during the day and using the Airbnb as just a place to sleep. The only negative was that he had a slow response time to my messages, but once he answered everything went great.",9.0
"Very well located, good collective amenities, a pity about the pool under renovation and an effort on cleanliness is to be considered, so it would be perfect, but we had a nice and pleasant stay",9.0

The apartment is well-located and very clean, we didn't miss anything. It has a very convenient parking space. The building in which the apartment is located offers a free large pool, sauna, squash court, and gym. 
Ben A is very responsive, his explanations for our arrival at the apartment were clear and precise. 
We recommend Ben A's apartment without any hesitation for a stay in Montreal.",9.0
"My parents are seniors and I booked Ben's place for their short stay in Montreal. This review is on their behalf.

They loved Ben's place and found it to be convenient, clean and perfect location. They found Ben to be polite, very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions or requests they had. Thank you Ben for being such a great host!",9.0
"Ben's place was very clean and quiet. He was very accommodating and communicative, and I would definitely stay there again.",9.0
"The location of this Airbnb is great, however, it fell short in many aspects. The suite was not clean. The bathroom was the worst. The sink did not drain well and had a terrible smell, the bath mat had hair and nail clippings in it. The shower curtain was brown at the bottom from not being cleaned. The plug to the tub was completely brown and disgusting. Bathing was out of the question. There were two very small toilet papers left that made us have to go purchase more along with soap. The baseboards throughout the suite were thick with dust. The kitchen had a dirty stove and fridge. The kitchen is not equipped with the essentials if someone wanted to cook. No cookie sheets for example, hardly any utensils. The couch was not comfortable and it had crumbs on it when we arrived. It is listed that there are candles but they were completely burnt out and the lighter did not work. We purchased our own because the suite bathroom sink had that bad smell. I will say Ben was good with communication and clear with details about how to get into the suite. I think this suite has great potential if it was cleaned. I didn't expect amazing for the price, but I did expect it to be clean.",9.0
"If you want to see Montreal, this is the apartment for you! Nicely appointed with everything you need to make your stay perfect. Easy walking to downtown, or a few minutes to the Guy-Concordia metro station if you prefer. An abundance of places to eat within 5 minutes. Grocery stores, parking... If you like to cook, walk 20 mins to the Atwater Market for gourmet food; detour on the way to see the pretty rue Coursol houses. If your shopping is heavy, come back by metro from Lionel-Groulx station.",9.0

"Ben's place was great! The apartment was just enough space for what we needed for the long weekend. The only thing that was an adjustment for us not being city people was the noise at night while sleeping, but that comes with staying in any city. Having the convenience store right across the street was a huge plus, along with the free parking. For the money that we paid for 3 nights and free parking to not have to worry about driving was definitely worth it. The location was (Website hidden by Airbnb) was very easy to walk to everything including Crescent Street (5 mins away) where there were many bars and restaurants to pick from. Can't forget about the Netflix being a huge plus too! I would definitely recommend. Thank you Ben!",9.0

The space met our needs perfectly. It was very clean and conveniently located within the city. We loved having off-street parking available! We would definitely use the space again.,9.0
"The place was fine, check-in was easy, but it was freezing cold. The heater wasn't working and it wouldn't warm up at all. We were visiting from the states and we didn't have data so internet was important for us—the internet kept going in and out, so we couldn't get a steady connection to research.",9.0

"Ben's condo is perfectly situated in the heart of downtown Montreal. The space is just as seen in the pictures; however, the shower is very small and the bathroom fan does not work. Also, there is a funky smell in the hallway but other than that, it was a beautiful stay. It was very clean and spacious enough for my partner and me. We also had access to the condo's pool, gym, and squash court which was awesome! Free parking was also a bonus! We would definitely stay here again. :)",9.0

fabulous experience,9.0
"There were stains on every piece of fabric, the sheets were dirty, there were only two towels provided and they were old and ratty. The building needed a lot of maintenance. The walls were so thin you could hear the phone vibrating next door. There was also a little yappy dog next door that barked almost constantly. The hallway smelled strongly of smoke along with other odors. The drinking glasses were broken. The furniture was rather cheap and extremely basic. The balcony had trash and cigarette buds strewn on it. There was mildew in the shower. This was not worth $75 a night plus the steep cleaning fee. I’ve never left a bad review before but this place was so disappointing! The free parking, easy check-in, and close proximity to the metro and Tim Hortons were nice.",9.0
"Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Ben's place. The location was great and it was one of the more budget-friendly options. The reviews were so good that I think our expectations were a little too high. In retrospect, we should have known there would be some compromises. The building is not very nice once you get past the lobby. The elevators and hallways often smelled of cigarettes and generally didn't seem very clean. The apartment itself was dark and had a slightly musty smell. It was clean except for some crumbs on the floor and couch, and the bedding which didn't look like it had been washed. We asked for it to be replaced, though, and Ben took care of it quickly while we were out for dinner. Ultimately, the apartment didn't get in the way of enjoying the city, and we had a little extra money left over to spend elsewhere.",9.0
"Great space for me and my significant other. Perfect location, and parking was secure and convenient.",9.0
"Ben was an excellent host and very helpful. My biggest issue with the place was the extremely loud noise level with incredibly thin walls. Neighbors were screaming, and dogs were barking until early in the morning. Otherwise, it was clean and easy, and Ben was great.",9.0
"This studio is in a fantastic location! It's perfect for a couple visiting who doesn't plan on spending all their time inside the studio, but needs a cozy space to check back in, take breaks throughout the day, and relax at the end of the day. Ben provided very clear and detailed instructions! I had a wonderful time.",9.0
"Well, here is a thing, I've given one star to this entire place and to cleanliness due to issues with bedroom sheets. They do not change them. And the whole bed and sheets had odors of sweat, some body smell, and on top of those ""reach"" smells, the cover of some deodorant or perfume - it might be used instead of washing the sheets or it might be just additional floral from the previous dozens of clients. 

So why one point? Because this is apparently a ""tradition"" at this place not to change sheets and not to listen to customers - the same issue was already addressed in the comments, and here we are at the same point with nothing done.
Finding it as a real disrespectful attitude towards the customers, especially when the same issue was already addressed by other people, but the owner still kept the same ""tradition"" of not changing the sheets. 
And in addition, the same place charged me $49 CAD for cleaning fees when the cost of the place per night was $31 CAD. So it is 61.25% of the whole price for cleaning. I think they could take $3 for the sheet's washing from those $49 CAD, but they didn't...
--
*Additional thing to keep in mind, that the apartment is in the center of Montreal and the windows are not really built with good sound isolation, so you might hear all the sounds of the street even during the night. 

Hope the review will change the attitude of the owner towards his customers.",9.0
"Ben's flat was quiet and secure, with the Metro nearby. Restaurants and bars were one block walk away. Parking on site was available for cars only, with a maximum height of 70"".

The apartment is functional; we didn't check out or use any of the extra amenities, so I can't say much about that. 

However, the apartment was perfect for a nice getaway weekend in Montreal. 
I enjoyed the jazz club around the corner and everything was clean and there. 

Thank you",9.0
"Nice and spacious apartment - a bit far from the metro, but the Bixi station was very close and a grocery store was within walking distance (5 minutes).

However, upon considering your stay here, please be aware that they are very serious about their cleaning - you should thoroughly clean (vacuum, mop, bathroom) before returning the keys to the apartment. I did not and he requested $50 after my departure (even though I didn't agree to this fee when booking).

Apart from that, it is located near many cute restaurants and shops.",9.0

"Three friends and I stayed at Philippe and Sandra's lovely apartment for the weekend. We arrived later than expected, but Sandra was very flexible and kind about this. The apartment itself was well equipped except for some small things, which were easily amendable as there is a grocery store just a few blocks away. The hosts were personable and sweet, and left many helpful books and maps to ease our exploration of Montreal. As far as location, we were able to walk all over the Plateau neighborhood easily, full of great restaurants and shops. There was easy access to the subway from the apartment to get to old town, downtown, etc. in just a matter of minutes, though walking was our preferred mode of transportation! Truly a great experience and good value, we would recommend Philippe and Sandra's place to any friend.",9.0

We'll definitely consider this place again.",9.0
"The apartment was brilliant! new, clean, comfy and with all the details to make you feel at home.

The reservation was cancelled 17 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0
Philippe lives in the same building and is therefore always available to say hello and offer any advice you may need. The flat is lovely and well-equipped with everything you need for a fantastic stay in Montreal.,9.0
"Super experience in Philippe and Sandra's apartment. 
Before arriving, they were available and easily contactable by email for any information or assistance.
We were four people in this accommodation, there was space for everyone, the apartment is therefore spacious, clean and warm. 
Philippe explained everything to us upon our arrival (apartment functionality, public transport, shops) and a information booklet is available at the living room.
The apartment is within a 10-15 minute walk of Laurier metro station which allows you to reach downtown. Shops and restaurants are nearby.
I highly recommend this accommodation.",9.0

"Philippe was very accommodating and very friendly.
The accommodation was exactly as he had described and even better. Everything was ready for our arrival, and the two beds were made. 
The apartment was well-located, and a 20m walk from the first bus that could take us to the metro.

The apartment was clean and all the comforts were there.",9.0
"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was very positive. 
I would highly recommend Philippe's place and would stay there again if I needed a place in Montreal.",9.0
A perfectly clean and pleasant accommodation suitable for 4 people. A warm welcome with several maps of Quebec and its region. Thank you very much,9.0
"Philippe was very welcoming and always responsive via Airbnb, though due to our personal scheduling we did not meet. The apartment was well furnished and had everything we needed during our stay. The location is great. Finding street parking was no trouble. A wonderful, nicely cultured neighborhood with many great shops, cafes, and restaurants close by, as well as a 10-15 minute walk to the metro.",9.0
"The apartment was very clean and Philippe was pleasant to work with.

However, I should mention that the entire apartment smells strongly of cigarette smoke and we were not given any notice of this (it even permeated the bedding and remained on our clothes for days after leaving). We were informed upon our arrival that this was from recent guests. I certainly understand that this was beyond Philippe's control, but we would have definitely appreciated a heads up beforehand as this would have affected our decision to stay at the apartment. In all other respects, we had a great stay.",9.0
"The neighborhood is pretty cute nestled in the Plateau, so close to many nearby places. The apartment is up a steep spiral staircase, so be careful going up in winter time. We had everything we needed and Philippe included a folder with a lot of information to help you get around. 

Although the bathroom is a little small, it was clean. Towels were included and we had no problems staying there. 

Thanks Philippe for everything!",9.0

The apartment is warm, cozy, with two nice bedrooms, a great kitchen and living area. Very pleased with this experience!",9.0
"This place matched the description perfectly - fantastic value for a two-bedroom apartment. I was in town visiting friends and it was perfect for my needs. The neighborhood is lovely - very close to places I wanted to go in the Plateau/Mile End, etc. Philippe was very friendly to communicate with and responsive to any questions we had. He also provided great directions and the coffee maker was a nice touch. Overall, just what I was looking for.",9.0
"We enjoyed staying in Philippes house, it was the perfect starting point to explore Montreal for the first time: The bus stops right in front of the door, you walk 10 minutes to the metro, and the little shops and cafés on Av. Laurier are only a few steps away. We had a friendly and helpful host, and the apartment was perfect for our little family (2 adults, 1 child). Everything was clean and well prepared for our stay.",9.0
"The house was great and within walking distance of everything, including the 2 train that takes you to downtown. The apartment comfortably fits 4 people and comes with cooking equipment if you need it, which I thought was really good. Phillippe and his wife were very good hosts and greeted us on our first day. For my next stay in Montreal, I will definitely be staying here again. A supermarket is right around the corner as well as a liquor store.",9.0
"Thank you very much to Philippe and Sandra for their hospitality.

The apartment was impeccable, bright. 

The neighborhood was quiet within two steps of a lively street (cafe, supermarket,...). 

10-15 minutes walk from the metro.

A great place to spend a wonderful stay in Montreal. 

Highly recommended.

Hervé and Marie-Pierre",9.0
"The accommodation is in accordance with the description. We stayed in the apartment for 3 people without any problems. The apartment was quite pleasant and its location, close to many shops and Laurier station, was quite practical (the station is a 10-minute walk or less than 5 minutes by bus, with the bus stopping right outside the apartment). Note: the apartment has access via a steep staircase (characteristic). 

Thank you Philippe and Sandra for their warm welcome.",9.0

"Personalized welcome from Philippe pleasantly surprised me. Everything was efficiently arranged for my arrival. Philippe wasn't present at my arrival, but the apartment was accessible via his clear instructions. The visit early the next morning to check in and offer breakfast was the cherry on top! This proves he cares about his clients' well-being. Everything is thought out in advance to ensure your comfort, down to the smallest details. This allows you to be independent right away, even if it's your first visit to Montreal! And I will definitely go back.",9.0
"My daughter and I loved Philippe's apartment in Montreal. The neighborhood was quiet, conveniently located near a strip of restaurants, a grocery store, and a drugstore. It was nice having a bus stop right at the bottom of the stairs. It was super clean and everything we needed was in the apartment. We'd gladly stay with them again.",9.0
"Spacious apartment as described, except for the bathroom which is not very large but that's enough. Everything you need is in the kitchen. Shops are 5 minutes away on foot. Very well located Bus at the doorstep of the apartment or metro 15 minutes away on foot. Philippe was absent upon our arrival but had everything organized. He came to see us when he returned. Very nice. We enjoyed a pleasant stay there.",9.0

"Spacious and well-equipped apartment for four people, perfectly clean and offering a pleasant ambiance (park Laurier with its calm or lively atmosphere, pool, general ambiance...).  The location is ideal for buses, the metro, Bixi bikes, as well as various shops (within 5 minutes).

We thank Sandra for her hospitality and explanations. Our hosts were very accommodating. For our first family visit to Montreal, we had a wonderful stay. Highly recommended.",9.0
"We are delighted with our stay at Philippe and Sandra's place. Practical, well-located, well-equipped, the apartment was perfect.  Philippe and Sandra's hospitality was warm and we greatly appreciated our exchanges with them. A tiny downside on the parking in the street which seemed complicated... but it seems to be the case in many streets in Montreal. Thank you again for their great availability.",9.0
"My friend and I had just a great experience at Philippe's. The place is cozy and located in a nice neighborhood.  Perhaps my only concern was the lack of air conditioning, which would be nice to have during the summer.",9.0
My stay was excellent. The unit was as shown on AirB&B. Philippe was very responsive and the unit was well located. Great stay!!! I would stay there again.,9.0
"We had a great stay at Philippe and Sandra's! The apartment was exactly as described and was ready and waiting for us to drop our bags and settle in when we arrived. The neighborhood is Montreal at its finest - brick buildings, small shops and cafés, green boulevards and parks, and very walkable. Philippe and Sandra answered all our inquiries promptly and were lovely hosts. We look forward to a chance to stay here again in the future!

One thing to note: due to some construction at the Laurier metro station entrance on Laurier Ave., the walk was a couple minutes longer to reach the other Laurier station entrance at Saint-Joseph Blvd. Nothing too much for avid pedestrians like us, but it might be for others. 

We also definitely recommend getting ice cream at Bo Bec on Laurier Ave! It's about a 5 minute walk from the apartment.",9.0
"An ideal apartment located in a quiet and friendly neighborhood!

We met Sandra who was incredibly kind, approachable, and gave us good advice.

We recommend this accommodation.",9.0
"This being our first Airbnb experience, my wife and I were very pleased with this clean, comfortable apartment. The hosts were helpful, and while we never met them in person, everything was well prepared for our arrival and they were very easy to keep in touch with before and during the stay. All amenities were as promised, the bed and bath were clean and comfortable, and there was just enough room for us to feel like we could spread out a bit while spending indoor downtime during our vacation. The neighborhood is pleasant, though prospective guests should know that it is located rather on the far northwest end of the Mont Royal Plateau area (about a mile north of Boulevard St. Laurent). But there are attractions nearer by as well, so all in all an excellent stay. Strongly recommended.",9.0
"Philippe and Sandra welcomed us with great enthusiasm, thank you to them for their hospitality. A nice apartment very well located in a lively neighborhood but remaining calm. 

Everything was perfect!!",9.0
"Philippe was present to welcome us even early in the morning. He showed himself very available for any help or advice. We already knew the neighborhood so we didn't have any particular requests but if the situation required it, we could easily reach him, especially since he lives on the ground floor. 

The apartment is functional, clean and comfortable.",9.0
"Although we didn't interact much with our host, we met him briefly during our stay and he was very welcoming and friendly. The listing was exactly as described. It was a gorgeous little apartment with everything you'd need for a short stay - extra blankets, iron, cutlery, etc. The neighborhood was also wonderful. I loved Montreal and I loved the apartment we had the wonderful opportunity to stay in. Thank you Phillipe!",9.0

The apartment is exactly as pictured, very well-arranged, everything is spotless. It is conveniently located, a 10/15 minute walk from the Laurier metro station and at the bottom of the street you'll find plenty of shops, perfect for grocery shopping and restaurants.

We stayed there for two months with a friend and we truly felt like home!

"My brother and I enjoyed our stay at Philippe and Sandra's place. Although I did not meet Philippe (but I did speak with him over the phone; he is a very nice guy), I did meet Sandra who was very lovely. She gave my brother and me a tour of the place and also made sure that where we were parked for our stay would be a good place to park to avoid parking tickets. Within the house, they provided a nice little manual that they drew up. It had a nice map with nearby restaurants, grocery stores, and public transportation, as well as instructions on how to use the TV and a listing of some of the more commonly used channels so you didn't have to go searching for them, along with information for connecting to the Wi-Fi. There were some basic cooking supplies (pots, cutlery, etc.) which was nice because it meant that we didn't have to eat out every night. The area was very nice and just a few minutes walk away from a very nice park, bike rental station, and swimming pool, and about a 10-15 minute walk to the Metro. From their place to Rue Sherbrooke and St. Laurent (where they had many festivities for the Grand Prix Weekend) cost my brother and me about $11 for the taxi ride. All in all, the place is nice though it is a bit small, especially the bathroom. However, the two bedrooms that were there were a good size and didn't feel cramped at all. As mentioned before, our stay there was enjoyable. I would stay there again.",9.0
"Unfortunately, we didn't meet Philippe, but everything was ready for our arrival despite our 3-hour delay at customs (waiting time). The apartment corresponds well to the photos. It is located approximately 14 minutes from the Laurier metro station and there is everything you need nearby.",9.0
"Our arrival was not unexpected, apart from the pleasant atmosphere of the neighborhood and its central street nearby.",9.0
"Philippe's place is a great home base while in Montreal. It's located in a lovely residential neighborhood. The place was nice, clean and had everything we needed. It's small but enough space for 2-3 people. We had no problems on arrival, just a bit of confusion on the checkout time but it ended up working out. Definitely important to know that the way in is up a VERY steep staircase! I would recommend staying here :)",9.0
"Everything was cool, especially because there was a small problem that Philippe quickly fixed. Montreal was a great surprise, now I know where I might run if Trump gets elected ;-)",9.0
"It was very easy to communicate via email. We never saw our host, however, it was easy to get in and use the apartment. There was a manual on the table describing, however, the first page is only in French. The place is clean and has all the minimum amenities. The bathroom and shower are very small, but the size of the kitchen and the apartment and the bedrooms are good.",9.0

"My friend and I had a great overall experience staying at Philippe's Airbnb. Philippe's wife initially greeted us with her huge smile and warm personality. The place itself was super clean and perfect for 2-3 people. Amenities wise, the place isn't as stocked as others I've been to, but that's probably because I've been spoiled at others so make sure you bring shampoo, soap, extra coffee and tea. Philippe is very quick at responding whenever you message him; he also lives downstairs so if you need anything just ring. For those driving there, street parking is available but it can be a bit confusing, make sure you read the signs like normal and you'll be fine. What else? That's about it! Cool, chill spot, neat shops around, perfect base camp.",9.0

The apartment is located on the first floor, reachable by a typical Montreal staircase. We stayed with 2 people in the apartment which was perfect. The place was clean and well-equipped. Everything you need was provided and looked like in the pictures. The bathroom was small but didn't bother us.  
Public transportation is nearby; the Metro is within walking distance (about a 12-minute walk), and the bus is right outside the house. Also, a bakery, supermarket, and pharmacy are close by. We felt at home living in a typical Montreal apartment situated in a nice environment.",9.0

"Our long weekend stay was great! There were good places to eat right down the street, and plenty of other good things to do within a short Uber ride away. My only issue was that the wifi was really slow and inconsistent. I kept just using my phone data to access maps and plan our outings. If I had work to do and was relying on the wifi to send emails with attachments, it would have been very frustrating. Also, the bathroom is very small - there's almost no leg room in front of the toilet. Aside from those two things though, everything else was great.

"We had a good stay at Philippe's apartment. It's basic, but it has everything you need and is great value for the price. We really appreciated the self-check-in and key code lock, which made our arrival and departure really easy and we didn’t have to worry about trying to coordinate around specific times. It was also great not to have to carry around keys! The apartment is within walking distance (right down the block) to a grocery store, liquor store, pharmacy as well as some restaurants and coffee shops and is also not a far walk to more options on Avenue du Mont-Royal. There is a bus stop right at the corner beside the apartment, but it is a bit longer of a walk to the metro (around 15 minutes). Just a note that the bed is a little firmer than usual, but that might just be personal preference. The apartment comes with all the basics you’ll need. Philippe was easy to communicate with and very responsive. Great spot for a home base in Montreal!",9.0

We had no difficulty finding this apartment as it was near the Cadillac metro station. It was very clean and everything inside had been remodeled so it had a feeling of luxury.  It had everything we needed from towels to kitchenware and refrigerator and microwave and toaster.  The TV was right in front of the bed and was filled with Netflix and other apps, so you could choose movies or TV shows from a large variety of choices. The apartment was about 2 blocks from the metro so it was very convenient to get to downtown, maybe in about 8 minutes. 

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Montreal!",9.0
"Great place, close to downtown Montreal. Thanks Steven! Would definitely recommend!",9.0
"Our place was tidy and cozy. There was everything a traveler would need, including all the utilities needed to cook and clean with, as well as extra towels and bathroom amenities. Our neighbors upstairs were a little noisy (you can hear their footsteps), as they had a small child or perhaps several who would run around in the mornings as well as late at night. When their doorbell rings, the lights inside the apartment will flash, and an alarm will sound. It is in a basement, but the location is fantastic. There was a nice park across the street, and it was only a few hundred meters from the subway, which will take you into the city in less than half an hour. Unfortunately, we did lose our key, and had to pay the most expensive option to regulate the situation. If this happens to you, purchase a Weiser SmartKey Relocking set at Walmart or Home Depot, a few kilometers away from the apartment for $15 to re-key it yourself, as the lock is a Weiser Smartkey lock, which does not need to be replaced to be re-keyed. With that said, be advised that since there is no security deposit, any potential damages will have to be discussed between you and your host. Other than losing our key and having to replace an entire lock rather than getting a new set of keys, we had a great time in Montreal and enjoyed our stay in Steven's lodging.",9.0

"A great experience! This was our first time visiting Montreal and the location of this apartment worked out very well. What a great value! It took us about 7 minutes or so to walk to the Metro in the morning which was incredibly easy to use. The area where the apartment is located is quiet and residential. The apartment was clean and felt brand new. Steven was very helpful and easy to communicate with. Easy and straightforward check-in and check-out. If (when) we're back in Montreal, we'll certainly book again!",9.0
"Pleasant accommodation, clean you would say entirely renovated with possibility of parking nearby.

Around 300m walk from the metro station, 20m walk from a park, 2km from the Olympic Park.

Friendly and clear owner.

Thank you so much!

We recommend it.",9.0
This place was exactly as advertised. We had a great time in Montreal and a pleasant stay here.,9.0
"Super clean, though small, apartment with easy parking (except Monday afternoons!) and easy access to rentable bikes (a 10-minute ride to the botanical gardens, 5 minutes to the biodome. Attention: when you rent the bikes, you'll be charged extra for trips over 30 minutes).  

About a 20-minute drive to downtown Montreal. Not a great food scene nearby, so expect to drive or bike your way to something. 

The apartment itself is fine—a bit warm in the summer—the bed isn't super comfortable, but that was our only complaint. Super clean, newly renovated, quiet area. Great value!",9.0
"Excellent experience! Apartment as per photos, well-equipped and very clean, close to the Cadillac metro station. Close to supermarkets and some restaurants too. 

Steven was unable to receive us upon our arrival, but his neighbor took care of it and we were very well received. 

Excellent value for money.

If we return to Montreal, we will definitely go back to Steven's.",9.0
"Stevens' place was great! It was so clean and new, and it had everything we needed right there available for us. He was very accommodating, friendly, and easy to deal with. Great price, great value. Highly recommend!",9.0
"Fidele to the photos, the bachelor apartment is partially renovated, clean and the bed is comfortable. Steven is very welcoming and professional, and gives good advice. The apartment is a bit secluded compared to the metro (800 meters), but is well-served by the bus (200 meters) so quite convenient (Website hidden by Airbnb). Recommend",9.0

"Photos are accurate; the place is very nice and clean. The metro station is about a 10-minute walk away, which isn't bad.

Overall, it was a perfect stay for me!",9.0

"The photo shows the house is 6211, but it's actually a garage. If you enter from the right side, you will see the house that belongs to Steven!  Although I mentioned ""down the driveway"" on Airbnb, the photos showed me the place as 6211. So I went there and made a mistake. It would have been better if I had taken a photo of the exact house location and how to get there. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience! The room was spacious and comfortable, perfect for hanging out with friends!",9.0

The place is super clean and really looks like the pictures. Steven answered fast. It looks like a big and comfortable hotel room. The shower cabin is small though. I will definitely stay here next time and I highly recommend it.,9.0
"Steven was a great host, very responsive through text when our flight came in late. He waited an additional hour to greet us and show us around the apartment upon arrival.

Great place for a great price,9.0
"Unbeatable for the price! Extremely clean space equipped with everything you would need for your stay. Just a few minutes walk from the metro which takes you right downtown.

A big thank you to Steven for his hospitality and his accommodation. It is very well located in a residential neighborhood and close to the metro. The apartment is really great for a weekend in Montreal,9.0
"Great location, so easy to get around via subway and nearby supermarkets. Steven was more than obliging when we were running a bit late, which we were very grateful for after our long drive. He came to meet us in person and showed us everything in the studio. It's a downstairs basement unit with a great kitchen. The bed was comfortable, parking is on the street which was sometimes busy but still managed to get one close by. We would definitely book again.",9.0
Overall very good. Would consider using again,9.0
"Translation: Perfectly as advertised, very clean and warm, ideal for a couple!",9.0

The host cancelled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,8.0
"Great location. The apartment was a little messy and dusty. The walls are very thin so we had problems sleeping because of the noise from the neighbors, besides the apartment being very hot (the fan wasn't enough). However, there weren't enough towels for the four of us (the ones we had were dirty and smelled bad).",8.0
"Apartment very well located within walking distance of the Old Port, Vieux Montreal and all amenities (restaurants, grocery stores, gas station, automatic laundromat...). Mount Royal Park is also accessible on foot for those who enjoy walking (we did it with our 5 and 8 year old children without any problems), as is Île Ste-Hélène by metro (10 minutes from the apartment).

Easy parking in the neighborhood, just be careful of the different parking signs because there are specific days and hours of parking for each zone.

The building is however a bit old with an exterior staircase that is slightly dangerous if you have children.",8.0
Great location. Lovely house. Larger than it appears in the photos. Pet-friendly. Highly recommend!,10.0
"Gorgeous home even better in person. The private parking spot is tight; we rented a van. Street parking is annoying as there are restrictions. We got two parking tickets! 

Great city with lots of parks, bakeries, markets and restaurants. Short walk to the subway. Can't wait to visit again",10.0
"This house has a lot of charm. Ideally located, it allows you to enjoy the attractions of the plateau while being very quiet.",10.0
"While Jean-Francois was out of the country during our stay, he went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable. This included lots of information and personal suggestions for dining and sightseeing, as well as excellent customer service including his friend who welcomed us upon our arrival. 

The apartment was very beautiful, comfortable, and welcoming! We were on a business trip and this apartment, with a terrace and a charming small garden, made us feel like we were on vacation after long days of work. We would definitely recommend staying here!",10.0
"Extraordinary apartments. Well located. (Restaurant, bar, bike path) 
On-site parking.",10.0
"We loved Jean-François's place. It was comfortable and close to everything. However, there was construction that started really early in the morning, around 7am in the morning! The construction noise woke us up and unfortunately was disruptive. Apart from the construction noise, the house was great and felt like home.",10.0
"Jean-François' place was delightful. It is a beautiful, two-story home in a charming neighborhood of Montreal. The home is clean, comfortable, and well-furnished. 

The off-street parking is tight. We were renting a Nissan Rouge, and it fit, but I don't think a larger vehicle would fit. This was fine because once we parked, we walked everywhere and the vehicle didn't move. 

We had a great stay and are already talking about coming back.",10.0
"It's a beautiful house. It's been lovingly decorated. Jean-Francois was easy to reach and stayed in touch with us. Excellent location with easy walking distance to bars, restaurants, and shops.",10.0
"Loved everything about this place, from the high ceilings, great kitchen, backyard patio, abundance of rooms to relax and recharge, this place was everything I hoped for. Central to most of Montreal, there is no trouble finding what you need from markets, coffee, parks, nightlife, and everything in between. I truly enjoyed my stay here.",10.0
"Jean-Francois was out of town during our stay, but he provided tons of information and recommendations for our weekend in advance, and we had no problem checking in late on our first night. This house is incredibly beautiful and spacious! There's so much to love - the art, the library upstairs, the kitchen, patio, and garden which we got to take advantage of with the fantastic weather during our stay. There was tons of room for our group of 3 couples to enjoy and recharge after wedding festivities for our friends downtown. Anything you need is within walking distance. I would highly recommend this place and would consider staying here again with my friends!",10.0
"Great location in Mont Royal neighborhood, 5 minutes walk to the Metro which we used every day. Lots of restaurants nearby and a coffee shop directly across the street. The house has excellent air conditioning and the TV is large and new.  The beds were comfortable. There's a lovely patio out back where we ate a couple of times. There's a pretty park a short walk away.",10.0
"Cool place. Close to the mountains and great food. Not too far from the laundromat. Ubers and traffic were definitely an issue from this location (one-way), but it was a minor inconvenience in what was otherwise a pretty good stay.",9.0
"My friends and I booked Mano's place for a bachelor party getaway. It was fantastic! Perfect for a group of 6-8 guys looking to hang out in one area. Considering the building was old, I was very surprised at how well insulated the sound was. We rarely heard neighbors, if at all.  I'd say the only tiny issue is that the place is a little dated. It's not fancy, but it's a great place to stay for a group of friends.",9.0
"The apartment is in an incredibly awesome location, within walking distance to all the cool bars, restaurants, and shops in trendy Mile End. The rooms and beds are spacious, and it's great value for money if you need a place for a group of people to stay.",9.0
"Our group of five rented Mano's place in Montreal for a long weekend bachelor party. The house had six separate bedrooms and was in a convenient location, so it worked great for our purposes.

The location is great, with many bars/restaurants close by. There is also a bike share station down the block and a 10-minute walk from the nearest metro. Overall, it was a great centralized location to see a lot of the city.",9.0
"Our stay at Mano's place was very good, easy and comfortable. Mano answered very quickly and was very nice to accommodate our needs. The apartment is a bit old, so you can hear the wooden floor squeak, but everything else is set up for guests to enjoy their stay. The apartment is huge! We are a family of six and we had space to spare! The furniture was different from that shown in the pictures, but other than that it was just as described. The neighborhood seemed safe. We had a few walks at night to a 24-hour grocery store just two blocks away and that was very convenient. Overall, we had a great time. We would definitely stay there again! Thanks Mano!",9.0

I did not meet Janie personally and it was fine as I was looking for rest. However, Janie was very quick to respond to any message and overall I'm giving a 10/10 to Janie and her studio because my expectations were met 100% based on what I read and viewed on the application. I recommend this studio and will definitely go there again if it is available. Thank you, Janie.",10.0
"Great stay at Janie's apartment. Janie was an excellent host, easy to communicate with and checked to make sure we got settled in ok etc. The apartment is cozy and clean, has everything you need for a short stay. A bit farther from some of the busier areas in Montreal but very close to a Bixi bike station and 10 mins to the metro station which is handy. Overall a good stay, would recommend and great value!",10.0
Accommodation met our expectations in terms of description and comfort. The accommodation was very comfortable with excellent equipment in good condition. Excellent communication with Janie. A 10-minute walk to the metro station is not unpleasant on the street with large trees. Perfect for our weekend in Montreal.,10.0
"This was our first time checking out Montreal, which is a beautiful city! Janie helped us out a lot. She responded quickly to my questions and made check-in pretty easy. She was nice enough to have us check-out later than 10 a.m., which gave us more time to have a latte at Crew Collective & Cafe in Old Montreal. 

Janie's place is beautiful, clean, and cozy. The neighborhood is quiet and everyone is welcoming. Her place is a little far from everything else but she is 10 minutes away from the Metro which made it easier for us to get to downtown Montreal. On the bright side you get to explore the beautiful scenery!!!!

Excellent value for money - Easy access from the Jean Talon metro station and downtown is also well accessible. Convenience stores are nearby. Don't hesitate!",10.0
"I loved the location. Everything in Montreal is very spread out so even though it's 15 minutes from downtown by car, it takes a long time to walk anywhere. We went during January so the heating was awesome and we kept warm with the blankets provided for us on the bed. Some things to expect: there are some plumbing issues, so one water line shoots off in another direction when using the sinks and the shower. Also, the space is much smaller than I expected but it felt good for two people. Other than that, it was a very clean, convenient, and open space.",10.0

"Janie was a friendly and communicative host and I had an easy, comfortable stay. Good space for one person or a couple. If you're used to set-up-for-purpose Airbnbs, keep in mind that someone lives here when it's not rented out. Villeray is a nice quiet neighborhood and apart from upstairs neighbors walking around, you don't get any noise, it's peaceful and quiet. Close to Metro stops, although I walked into town a couple of times... Montreal isn't that big anyway!",10.0

"It is a cozy basement apartment that has almost everything you might need, but it could be cleaner regarding towels and dust. It was sad to mention that I didn't feel very welcome there as during my 3-night stay I was reminded twice to check out before 10 am as there were other visitors arriving right after us. For the wifi connection, you would have to use a little bit of logic as the details provided are not quite right. Overall, it is a nice place for this price.",10.0

"The place is super clean and cozy. I totally recommend it for couples or students who need a quiet place after classes. A bit far from the center if you don't have a car (12-15 minutes). By metro, it takes 30-40 minutes to get there. It was worth it for me. The neighborhood is very quiet.",10.0

Gabriel's place was perfect for the few days my husband and I spent in Montreal -- it's a great size and in a perfect location! He was great at communicating with me before we arrived so that check-in was a breeze -- he also made sure we had two lattes waiting for us at the nearby coffee shop! We would definitely stay there again.,9.0
It was a pleasant stay and the apartment was spacious and comfortable. There are many shops and good restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood! Gabriel is a great host.,9.0
"Gabriel's apartment was fantastic! We were pleasantly surprised by the front and back terrace both with seating! The queen bed was very comfortable! The apartment was clean and easy to access. It is steps from Saint Laurent and a 5-minute walk to Mont Royal station. So much good food and amazing coffee around the corner. Had an almond milk flat white every morning at Paquebot!!! There is a park around the corner and a grocery store at the end of the street. Even though there wasn't air conditioning, the apartment was quiet cool being on the bottom level. Although it was still very bright with the sliding doors! Gabriel was quick to respond and check-in and checkout was very smooth and easy!! I highly recommend staying at Gabriel's!!",9.0
"This is indeed a magnificent place, especially (for me) the balcony - which is the size of three or four normal balconies in other cities. You can enjoy the full sun on it in the morning and have shade by afternoon. Luc and Constance clearly love their place and keep it well. If you are the type who wants every last technological comfort, this may not be for you, but if you don't mind living without, say, a microwave or can deal with a bit of difficulty getting in and out of an older bathtub, and you love lovely spaces - this is for you! (that said there is still a large TV screen and cable which you don't get everywhere). Downstairs, Jean, the owner, is also very welcoming and accommodating should you need anything.",9.0
"Great place, great host, great location - highly recommend!",9.0
"Great place; it really makes you wish you could just take over Luc's lease and stay here permanently. The main feature of this apartment is the great balcony in the back. We stayed here for three weeks. Living in his neighborhood and this apartment in the summer, you are truly living the best Montreal life possible.",9.0
"Good location, wonderful balcony with many flowers. We were with two kids and the balcony was a very good option for all of us while we were there since our kids like to be outside. The place has almost everything you might need at your own home except air conditioning. You need to climb stairs, but it's only for one floor. We didn't have any problems using it. The floor is wooden so it's a little bit creaky. Overall, very good place to stay. Thank you Luc for being a great host.",9.0
"A very nice place to reserve
I have no doubt on recommending this wonderful private room
The host really made me feel at home!

Very spacious room with balcony

She was so friendly, her apartment was cozy, and the room too.
She left me something for breakfast every morning before she left for work! So nice of her.

The location is a real plus, about 1 block or so from a metro station and walking distance to Cote-des-Neiges where you can find everything.

"Fantastic stay in Montreal with Catherine and her husband. 
The apartment was lovely, and the neighborhood suited us perfectly. Jean-Talon market within walking distance, filled with fresh foods. A great wine store nearby. All kinds of good restaurants including some of the best El Salvadoran food I've ever eaten.
Hosts were fantastic, invited us down for a lovely evening of wine and cheese, but otherwise left us alone...except when we needed something or had a question. 
It is well located, with two metro lines and buses nearby. As we are mostly walking people, we loved the location in the very heart of the island. Very nice neighborhood.
My wife and I would happily stay there again and look forward to our next visit.",10.0

I wasn't sure if it might be off the beaten path, but it was very close to nightlife. The Plateau/Mile End neighborhoods are the cool neighborhoods to check out if you want fine dining and a hip scene. 

My wife and I spent a weekend at Fanny's apartment and she gave us some great local tips on our arrival. The two-bedroom apartment is stylish and clean, and her large back porch is nice for a quiet break from the busy neighborhood.

I would definitely stay there again.",10.0
"Great location and good communication, would definitely stay here again.",10.0
"I am sure the hostess is a kind and generous person with many insights into Montreal. Because of omissions in the listing and events that occurred after my arrival, I chose not to stay.

Fanny offered to email a list of places to eat. I left the US on the 19th. The email was received on the 20th. Due to limited internet access and data roaming charges, I was not checking my email after I left home.

I left my bag at the room while I was searching for parking. The room is off the kitchen. It was 83 degrees outside that evening and the room was even warmer. The bed and a fan were next to the window. I could see the patio table and chairs from my pillow. Fanny apologized, saying the comforter was in the dryer. We laughed thinking it was not needed. 

As I have done many times before, I prefer to park my car and walk a city. Parking here is limited to parking meters or resident permit parking. There are no parking garages. There is no off-street parking. Construction on side streets further reduced available parking. While walking, I was bumped by a motorist coming out of an alley and hit a second time by a bicyclist traveling in the wrong direction. I spent 20 minutes circling the neighborhood looking for parking. Meanwhile, the police, a tow truck, and an ambulance were collecting a motorcyclist at the corner of Av Laurier and Saint Urbain in front of Lio Fratelli. 

I invested a considerable amount of time planning my trip to Montreal. It was not my plan to spend a beautiful summer evening driving in traffic translating ""No Parking"" signs. Had I known in advance that there was no parking, I would have spent the $200 for air conditioning, room service, and parking elsewhere. It was not worth the risk to stay. I was looking forward to seeing this great city. After driving seventeen hours, I drove another five and arrived home in the US at 12:30 AM",10.0
"Fanny's place is very cute, clean, and homey. I didn't stay for long, so I wasn't able to take full advantage, but the terrace is great.

I look forward to staying here again.",10.0
"Fanny's place is great. The place is located in a great neighborhood with walking distance to the metro (about 10-12 mins) and there are many great breakfast/restaurants/bars around. 
The place is stylish and comfortable as described. The patio is particularly great.  Even though I need to share bathroom with Fanny, but she is very accommodating to the guests, I feel like I have the bathroom to myself throughout my stay. 

Fanny is a great host who is communicative and easy to talk to. And she keeps a low profile to give the guests enough privacy which I really appreciate. I also got a lot of local tips for good places to eat and visit from her.

Overall, great experience, highly recommend",10.0

She had prepared a super map of the area marking all the special places for shopping, cafes, and so on AND she left a bunch of goodies for breakfast which was so appreciated. The flat is fabulous. Super clean, bright, and very well equipped. There is even a little balcony. It is kitty corner to the De L'eglise metro so you have easy access to public transit.

The subway/metro is very close by to the apartment (perhaps a three-minute walk) and allows for convenient travel to pretty much every aspect of Montreal.

Though I was unable to meet Laurence personally due to an emergency, she made me feel welcomed by leaving fruit and bread in the apartment as a little snack for the next morning. In addition, there was a cute welcome note scrawled on a small chalkboard near the front door and a list of her favorite nearby hangout spots.

It's a very attractive space with large windows, big closets, and perfect couches and chairs to watch TV or curl up and read. We've long been fans of Verdun, and this is perfectly located near the metro, several cafes, a couple of blocks to the IGA, organic produce around the corner, the fromagerie further down Wellington, and the beautiful park (even in the snow and cold of April) that stretches for miles along the St. Lawrence.",10.0
"5 stars!!!!! I cannot imagine how our stay could have been any better.

Laurence was an absolutely wonderful hostess. She left a few breakfast foods for us to enjoy on our first morning (bananas, a loaf of bread, yogurt, juice). Very thoughtful! She left guidebooks of Montreal for both of us and even printed a map of Verdun with personal suggestions of her favorite cafes, shops, and attractions. A local's input is invaluable. We did visit a few of her favorite spots and were very pleased. Thank you, Laurence! 

As for the apartment itself, it was modern, bright, spacious, and very clean. The photos posted do in fact reflect the reality. I loved waking up to this calming space and coming home there after a day of sightseeing. It was truly a place where we could relax. 

The neighborhood was great, with many cafes and shops to explore on the main street (Wellington). For non-Quebec residents who are GoodLife members, you can use your membership to work out at Energie Cardio, which is a 10-min walk down the street. That was a nice bonus for me, since I was away from my regular gym for a whole week. The subway stop (A l'Eglise) was indeed just a minute's walk away. Sometimes, I traveled by myself, and I can assure you that I felt safe coming home at night all alone. 

One word of warning for those whose parallel parking is not up to snuff: parking can get tight on the street. I noticed this is typical of Montreal in general, not just this neighborhood. Start practicing now, folks!",10.0
"Spectacular!! I can summarize it in one word... We loved it from the moment we arrived. Laurence (who speaks French, English and Spanish) had already made arrangements to make us feel at home, he had some things ready in the fridge, fruits, and a welcome sign, as well as a small crib for our 2-year-old son. He was very attentive to our concerns and advised us on good places to visit. He gave us some metro maps, the sector is excellent for newcomers (it has very economical stores and excellent multicultural restaurants), plus the metro is just one minute walk away. The house had absolutely everything we needed to prepare any meal, its appliances are in great condition as well as the whole interior.

The accommodation itself has no hidden features; there's a washing machine and dryer for easy laundry throughout your stay. The food options are diverse and plentiful.

"This unit was everything as advertised. The location was spectacular - literally less than 5 minutes walk from Place d'Arms Metro station (orange line) and less than 10 minutes walk from Place d'Arts Metro station (green line). This made it so so easy to see different parts of the city via the Metro and our trip experience was definitely heightened by this. From midway up the building you have an amazing view of both Old Montreal and the Musée des Arts. The balcony is the perfect size for two people to sit and have their morning coffee. The unit was clean, the linens crisp and it was equipped with air conditioning, which was a welcome relief from the 32 degree Celsius weather outside. You have access to a gym, pool and terrace that also has a beautiful view. Mike's assistant Vincent was extremely patient with us after we arrived later than anticipated due to road construction. He gave us great tips about the city and the immediate vicinity which helped us plan our week. Overall, the location, stunning view and well laid-out unit made this trip a 10/10.

First successful AirBnB experience!! Pamela is a very welcoming and patient host (she waited for me until my arrival at 10:30 PM).

"We had an amazing time at Pamela's place, she welcomed us warmly and explained everything to us about the apartment and neighborhood. Super friendly and helpful, she made herself available to us by email or phone for any questions we had about anything. 

The apartment is big, very clean and super sunny :) Very comfortable bed. A grocery store and liquor store are at the corner, very close to Beaubien metro station, 2 blocks away from St Hubert shops, tons of restaurants and bars - the location is great - about 15 mins from downtown. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you Pamela and Fernando for your hospitality!",10.0
"The apartment was just like in the pictures. The location was very good, close to the metro and downtown. We stayed 11 days. During that time, we experienced a lot of noise coming from the other apartments; we could hear everything happening downstairs in the owner's house. The oven was also so dirty it even started the fire alarm when we tried to preheat it. The bathroom also had visible mold on the ceiling. Pamela and her husband refused to give us the wifi password, forcing us to wait for them for every electronic device we had. The bed kept breaking. We had a lot of trouble reaching Pamela or her husband on the first day; however, when we did they were very nice and kind to us.",10.0
"I stayed in the apartment for one night. It was a nice apartment. Everything was well-furnished and complete. Pamela welcomed me warmly and explained everything to me even though I was there only for one night. She was very flexible with the departure time. So, I recommend this apartment.",10.0
"Pamela was an excellent host. She contacted us in advance to ensure we would either meet or have the entrance code for the door. That was so helpful because we were driving and couldn't say exactly when we'd arrive. The listing was accurate, and we were very pleased with the sweet little apartment. The neighborhood is residential and quiet, but has convenient shopping right around the corner. It was also convenient to be around the corner from a Metro stop. The mattress was fabulous! We had a wonderful time there.",10.0

"Pamela was an excellent host, very friendly and always offered prompt and thorough responses. The place was clean and had great lighting.

"We found our hosts Pamela & Fernando to be communicative, friendly and helpful- thank you! The apartment was as pictured and described, in a good location just a short walk from the metro with some nice cafes and a grocery store nearby. We had a very busy itinerary and only needed basic accommodations for sleeping and bathing and this apartment was a nice fit for us - a good price, a comfortable mattress and fairly close to where we needed to be. Thanks again!",10.0
"I enjoyed a night at Pamela & Fernando's studio, a much-needed break for our family. It was truly wonderful! The space is perfect for individuals or couples and the apartment is bathed in natural light, which is very pleasant.  Additionally, the hosts are discreet and very welcoming. While not completely soundproof like most Montreal apartments, this is just a minor detail that Pamela & Fernando unfortunately can't control, so how could we hold it against them? The noisy neighbors should simply go to a hotel, after all! I would have loved to stay in the small apartment for a few more days!",10.0
"Pamela and Fernando were amazing hosts, and were lovely enough to welcome my boyfriend and me into their home for an evening chat!

Pamela sent me great instructions on getting there from the airport ($10 bus ride, and you can use the same ticket to transfer to the underground that takes you 3 blocks from the apartment). I especially enjoyed having Vietnamese pho a few blocks south of their apartment. Overall, an awesome experience.",10.0

"A memorable address for an excellent welcome in a neighborhood that may be a bit far from Berri-UQAM, but well served by public transportation. I had a fantastic stay at Dominic's who is warm, attentive and helpful. The room is super nice and the bed of very good quality. Honestly, I recommend this address! Thank you again, Dominic!",10.0
"Super weekend spent with Dom and Phil, two very welcoming and warm friends who are ready to give you the best tips in Montreal. Thanks to you both!",10.0
"It's my first trip to Montreal and I'm glad that Dominic and his roommate Philip hosted me! I have to thank Philip in particular for helping me check into their apartment when Dominic was away.  Having taken a Greyhound bus departing quite late from NYC and arrived just too early in Montreal, I was just dying for an early check-in to lay my head down. Philip made my bed and gave me many suggestions about the city as he could, sorry Philip, I know I let you get tongue-tied many times;) Dominic was also very nice and responsive. He handed me complementary blankets just in case I might catch a cold at night. As to public transportation, it was only 2 minutes walk to bus station 94/197, the former takes you to Station Frontenac on Green Line and the latter to Station Rosement on Orange (Website hidden by Airbnb) could always rely on STM to go to all the tourist sites, like the old port and Mont-Royal etc. There were also several grocery stores like IGA and restaurants and bars nearly. My room was spacious with a comfy bed! I should never forget to mention their lovely patio at the back, a nice spot to chill in summer! I highly recommend Dominic's place to you all!",10.0

"My husband and I spent three nights at Dominic's apartment, and it worked out beautifully. The apartment is well laid out, and the room is both clean and comfortable. There is a good amount of space and a desk for your belongings. The bed is of very high quality.  There are bus stops near the apartment, but we prefer to walk a lot and see the city and people, so we spent almost all our time on foot. Dominic and his roommate Philip are warm and gracious hosts who are most helpful. I would not hesitate in the least to return to this apartment on another trip back to Montreal. You will be pleased with this choice. Thank you!",10.0
"Perfect Airbnb!
Dom is super cool, very sociable, in 5 minutes you will feel at home.
The neighborhood is easily accessible (metro 10 min walk, or the bus just downstairs), a supermarket is located right across the building.

If you're a hockey fan, this is the place for you!",10.0
"We had a wonderful stay with Dominic. We found him warm and engaging, and very helpful regarding information about getting around the city. His space was clean and comfortable.

"Staying at Dominic's place was great! The place is super clean and the room awesome. There's enough space for everything and it's really cozy. Especially the big window is a big plus! Sometimes the apartment can be very busy as Dominic and Phil like to invite friends over. But if you're looking for a nice chat or want to get to know new people, then you shouldn't have a problem. However, if you need to go to bed early or want to work, it might be a bit too busy sometimes. Dominic is a great communicator and a lot of fun. You will feel welcome in the apartment as it's cozy and everything is there (big kitchen, shampoo etc.). The best access to public transit is the 197 to Station Rosemont or the 94 to Station Frontenac. I would definitely stay again at the place!",10.0
Dominic is a really nice host! I had a great time there. The location is perfect. I would definitely book this room again next time!,10.0

"Dominic's place is a very nice, clean, and affordable space to stay in Montreal. The apartment is located in a very nice, tree-lined neighborhood with supermarkets, restaurants, a park, and other amenities nearby. The bus stop to connect you to the metro is only half a block away and the metro station is only about a ten-minute bus ride away. Once you hop onto the metro, the center of the city of Montreal is only about five stops away.

The apartment is very clean and simply decorated (if you are the ""Bells and Whistles"" type of person, you won't like it as much as I did). The room is a very nice sizable room with a big window. The only drawback is that the window opens to a Boulevard and there is no escaping the outside noise whether from street traffic passing through or otherwise (if you are a light sleeper, beware of that fact and be prepared to get awakened by noise in the early hours of the morning). 

The host Dominic is very nice, very welcoming, easy going, hospitable beyond delight, and, above all, super accommodating. He gave me access to everything in the kitchen, the living room, the back patio, and the bathroom. I really enjoyed my stay at Dominic's apartment and I highly recommend it to any travelers passing through Montreal (whether it's for a short stay or a long haul) DOMINIC WAS A FANTASTIC HOST..........!!!",10.0

"I stayed with Dominic and Phil for 3 months and 15 days. Dominic and Phil, along with Phil's girlfriend, were very easygoing and easy to get along with. As a bartender, I would sleep at awkward times of the day, and everyone respected my sleep hours and kept quiet. The place was always kept clean. The room was a comfortable size, and I spent a lot of time there but always felt welcome to sit and watch TV as a group or alone. They gave me my own dry space and fridge space to keep my food, and they had all the necessary utensils and pots for cooking. Also, you don't hear any neighbors upstairs or downstairs, so I always slept comfortably and well.",10.0

A tip: We rented bikes through (Website hidden by Airbnb) and found a good alternative and complement to the metro and buses.

First of all, Tanguy & Uriel really took good care of us. From the booking date to the day trip, they were making sure we got all the information needed (my wife and I) to get to their place with minimal trouble. 

Secondly, during the time we spent there (it was only one night, but I would stay longer if I could), they were also really pleasant, welcoming, and easygoing hosts. 

I highly recommend their places and thank them for making our stay so great. 

Lastly, the location of the house, in my opinion is pretty good. Near both downtown and the highway (we were coming from Quebec), so easy to get in from Highway 20 and to leave too, avoiding all the traffic jams.

The place has one bedroom and two convertible sofas in the living room, cable TV and Netflix are bonuses. There was coffee, tea, and cold drinks in the fridge. From preparing for the trip to the post-departure, they have been very attentive and responded quickly. We highly recommend this accommodation.

"The first thing that led us to choose the place was not having to worry about unexpected cancellations of our stay, as the hosts have the location exclusively for rental.

We really enjoyed the accommodation, a pleasant, clean and well-located place with a market, pharmacy and metro/bus stops very close by. 

The hosts were very polite and friendly and always (Website hidden by Airbnb)  we will definitely be back!!!
Tanguy and Uriel, thank you so much for your attention!",10.0
"Very good welcome from Uriel! The places are recent, modern and fully equipped which is fantastic! Moreover, everything is nearby, weather, supermarket, city center etc... Uriel will advise you on possible outings!  It's worth noting that the street is free for parking all week except from 12pm to 1pm on Monday, which is great for Montreal! I highly recommend it!",10.0

"This is a great ground floor apartment with convenient access to buses and two metro stops, with many cool places within walking distance. They live right above if you need anything and offered really good dining options when we first arrived. Tanguy and Uriel were super communicative. The bathroom and kitchen are very pretty and the shower was amazing after a long day of trekking around the city. We loved it! Thank you!",10.0
"A very clean and accessible place to stay. Perfect for up to four people. About a 10-minute walk to the STM train, and a 5-minute walk to the STM bus. $7-9 CAD Uber to La Banquise (best poutine in town!) which is on a main street with several shops. Lots of street parking. Had the privilege of running into Tanguy, Uriel, and their adorable kiddos. Awesome hosts and family, would definitely stay here again!",10.0

"Uriel and Tanguy's place was wonderful, exceeding all expectations! Everything was clean, linens and kitchen were well stocked, and there was plenty of room for three friends. The only minor negative was that it is not downtown, but is about a seven-minute walk to an easy-to-navigate metro. However, it is very close to the biodome and Olympic stadium, and driving (another pro: not having to pay to park downtown, as street parking is easy at their place) is only about six minutes. What really pushed the experience over the top was the great communication skills of the host: they were super responsive before and during our stay, and it was made clear they were there if we needed anything while still respecting everyone's privacy. They were also very accommodating that one of our guests was arriving early, and even let us know when the room was ready! A great level of kindness, and a great host. Would definitely stay at their apartment again next time I'm in Montreal",10.0
"Very good reception. Very beautiful apartment, beautiful decoration and very clean! I recommend it for a stay in Montreal.",10.0
"The place was perfect, super roomy and complete with various extra amenities. Tanguy & Uriel stocked this apartment so well, I️ was in disbelief we paid so little for it. They were extremely kind, even helping a member of my group print out his bus ticket. We ended up using Uber to go downtown a lot, which was a quick 10-15 minute car ride. The price for this place caught our eyes but the apartment exceeded our expectations greatly. Best Airbnb I’ve stayed at so far! Thanks Tanguy&Uriel",10.0

The only thing that was somewhat of a challenge was that we heard a lot of noise coming from the neighborhood, but aside from that, it was a good stay!",10.0
"""Top accommodation. The description accurately reflects reality. It was very clean and had everything we needed (shower gel, dish soap, tea, salt, pepper...).

Would definitely recommend this Airbnb for small groups (ideally between 1-3 people: 1 bed and 2 sofa beds).",10.0

The apartment is not in the center of town but very conveniently located: in a quiet residential area just 5 min away from a subway station and a supermarket. And also from that subway station is at the beginning of the gay village, on St Catherine street (the one with the rainbow), where there are many bars and restaurants.

"Coming from NYC, I loved the laid-back atmosphere of Montreal. The people were absolutely amazing on all levels. Starting with Alfredo. At first meeting, he was nice enough to come meet me at the subway station and walk with me to the apartment and tell me about the neighborhood. Alfredo was such a gracious host - from meeting me at the subway and giving me a tour of the neighborhood on the way to the apartment to making sure I felt welcomed and at home in his place - one of the best I've had. He had beautiful fresh flowers from the market around the house, some amazing yogurt in the fridge to start the day (have to find this back home) and even had a personalized map to welcome me to the neighborhood. 

The location is absolutely perfect. The apartment itself is nestled between some of the city's top-rated restaurants and shops. The canal is situated right at the end of the block for the perfect after-super stroll. There is a market about two blocks away that was just about perfect in every way. 

The neighborhood shops and their keepers really made it feel like a neighborhood - one that I wish I had had more time to spend in.
I would highly recommend this place and I'm hoping I can visit again soon.",10.0

On top, there's a clean bathroom with washer/dryer and the bedroom bed is very comfortable! As for the neighborhood, it's great. Lots of bars, bistros, and charming cafes, a young and vibrant area with many patios in the summer. A short walk from Atwater Market and Canal Lachine, two excellent spots for a stroll or to be amongst people. In short, I will definitely stay there again on future visits to Montreal!",10.0
"One of the best Airbnb experiences we've ever had! Alfredo is an amazing host who embodies what Airbnb is all about. He greeted us at the place, insisted on helping us carry our big suitcases, left us wine and macaroons (!!) at the place and was so gracious and responsive throughout our stay. The place was a complete delight. Clean, comfortable, centrally located right by AtWater and just 5 minutes from the Metro station. Lots of cool bars and restaurants right down stairs, even a natural store and pharmacy. The bed and shower were comfortable, enjoyed everything about this place! When we checked out Alfredo came to see us out, once again insisted on helping with the luggage and was fun to chat with for a few minutes until our Uber got there. We are Airbnb super hosts and feel like Alfredo inspired us to be even better by adding his own personal touch and lots of thought into his hosting. We recommend staying with him highly!!! Your Montreal experience will be amazing, you will feel just like a local with the comfort of home!! Thank you Alfredo! We will be back!",10.0
"Alfredo's space was a great home base for us during our week in Montreal. It's a fantastic location - we loved being near Atwater Market, and we ate at several of the restaurants in the area. It's also a fantastic spot if you want to get around by metro, since the Lionel Groulx station is on both the orange and green lines, which was perfect for us (we used the metro a lot). Alfredo was a great host who was happy to answer our questions and I'd definitely recommend his place!",10.0

"I was in the city for a conference downtown and the place was perfect. I could hop on the metro around the corner and quickly get downtown, and then retreat into this sweet little neighborhood with great restaurants and cafes, the Atwater market just across the street, and take long runs up and down the canal or to the river.  Also a great public pool just down the street. Such a laid-back vibe in the area! The apartment is just as nice as in the photos and the stuff in the place is nice - crisp sheets, nice towels, good kitchenware, etc. Alfredo is a superhost who greeted me with an overview of the place and area, and made himself available if anything came up (which nothing did). I will definitely stay in this area if I return and @ Alfredo's if it's available.",10.0
"My favorite Airbnb to date. Alfredo was a fantastic host and very accommodating. He was there on arrival with everything we needed (including some macaroons and beer in the fridge!). Gorgeous apartment, very spacious and clean. The neighborhood was fantastic with countless bars and restaurants and close to the canal, market, and the metro. We walked into the city some days and took the metro others but either way, fabulous location without having to be too far from the city to not have the pleasure of seeing the canal etc. Our flight time was changed last minute and Alfredo was very accommodating in allowing us to leave our luggage at the apartment. He was super quick in responding and catered to every need. I can't recommend this listing enough. BOOK!",10.0
"Absolutely brilliant flat, super clean, Alfredo is incredibly friendly and easygoing, happy to answer all questions with a big genuine smile. The flat is very well-equipped, with TV, washing machine, a great big shower room, and a very comfortable bed. 

I will definitely stay there again.",10.0
"Alfredo is a great host and his apartment is in a great location. It's located on a lively street with several restaurants and Irish pubs, and 5 minutes walking from the supermarket, farmers market, and the canal. We will definitely look for its availability next time we visit Montreal.",10.0
"I had a wonderful stay at the unit hosted by Alfredo. When I arrived at the unit, I let myself in with a key from a lock box and Alfredo arrived 30 minutes later to introduce himself and provide information about the unit. He graciously supplied a case of water and a much appreciated bottle of craft Quebec beer.  

The unit itself is in a safe and thriving neighborhood about a 5-minute walk from the Atwater Market. The entrance to the unit is through a locked door at street level and up a flight of stairs to the front door. Inside, the unit is very spacious and bright, with windows that face the street.  The living room and kitchen are on the first level and the bedroom, washroom, and laundry facilities are on the second level. 

The unit is stylishly decorated and furnished, with a strong wifi signal throughout. There is a long sofa facing a top-class entertainment system which I didn't have time to use. The kitchen area is roomy and has a dining table. Although I just made coffee in the mornings with the cream and ground coffee supplied by Alfredo, there are plates, cutlery, and utensils for those planning to cook their own meals.

I had a comfortable sleep on the king-sized bed and the blackout shades kept the room completely dark when I slept in. The bathroom is well stocked with toiletries and the shower has excellent pressure with lots of hot water. 

All in all, the apartment completely met my expectations and I would certainly consider renting it again the next time I'm in Montreal.",10.0

"Our stay at Alfredo’s place was amazing. 

The place is spacious, very clean, comfortable, decorated with good taste, and has everything one may need. I really liked his apartment. 

It is very well located, the restaurants and bars around are great and in an easy 30 minute walk you are downtown or in old Montreal. Very pleasant area to be outside and felt very safe. 

Alfredo always answered my messages within 5 minutes and was incredibly helpful and generous. 

I highly recommend this place. Thank you Alfredo!",10.0

"Great location for restaurants, Atwater Market, and Lachine Canal. The apartment on two levels is well set up for a couple but may not be comfortable for all parents with young children due to the steep stairs. We liked it despite construction outside during our stay. Only criticism of the kitchen was the lack of microwave and lighting that could be better. Same for the shower (lighting). We would come back, I think.",10.0

"This was the third time staying at Alfredo's. Always wonderful. It was really cold out and the heating worked really well. All very clean and comfortable. Alfredo's communication is swift, detailed and polite. He is friendly and welcoming. The area is nice, central but with a neighborhood feeling. I explored Atwater market this time and had a great time. Highly recommended. Overall everything was as expected, perfect. Would stay again? Yes! Thank you Alfredo",10.0
"Highly recommended! Alfredo's place is beautiful, comfortable & homey. We were able to walk or take the Metro everywhere. The location was perfect as we were in town for a show at the Theatre Corona - a 3 minute walk away. I appreciated Alfredo's hospitality. He greeted us in person, arranged parking for us, and even had some local treats sitting out for us. The bed was so comfy! Great place to stay.",10.0
"As always, Alfredo is a wonderfully accommodating host who truly has earned the moniker Superhost. 
When faced with a potential canceled flight, Alfredo did not hesitate to suggest for me to stay an extra night. A tremendously accommodating offer!
Thank you, Alfredo.",10.0
"This was my fourth time at Alfredo's. That says it all! Alfredo is a fantastic host. The space is amazing, so close to some of the best restaurants in Montreal and to Atwater market where you can get anything from great cheese, bread, produce and fish. Being so close to the 747 bus to the airport is perfect, 25 minutes to the airport for $10 couldn't be better. All in all, I truly enjoyed staying there and I feel ""at home"" at Alfredo's! He always leaves a little present, this time it was a great bottle of wine. Thank you!",10.0
"This is a great place to stay in Montreal. We were in town for a show at the Theatre Corona and Alfredo's apartment was less than two blocks away. The neighborhood has many great dining options within steps from the apartment, but also extending out a few blocks. There are also some cute boutiques to check out. The Old Poet, Botanical Gardens, and Mile End are a 15-20 minute drive, so getting around is easy.  

The apartment itself was fantastic. Sparkling clean, comfortable, lots of light, nice towels, and a very comfortable bed. Alfredo was great to deal with before, during, and after our stay. He was responsive, excellent at communicating, offered tips and recommendations, and even left us some welcoming treats. We will definitely stay at Alfredo's again.

The apartment is lovely, spotless and a really homely place to stay. Alfredo has thought of all the little touches, and the location is perfect, with easy transport to/from airport and loads of great cafes, restaurants, markets and bars nearby. The Lachine Canal nearby is also great for running.

Alfredo makes everything simple. Check in and check out is easy and his communication throughout was great. 

Thank you Alfredo - you played a big part in our amazing holiday!",10.0
"There are two key components to my review. The first is Location, Location and Location. You could not want for a better place to stay in Montreal. Firstly, you're barely five minutes from the Atwater Market to get all those amazing goodies for your meals (which we did!) and five minutes from one of the Metro stations that will get you to most of the key sightseeing places in Montreal. We didn’t use our rental car during our three-day stay there. On top of that, walk out the apartment door and whether you went left or right, there was an amazing selection of cafes to choose from. 

Secondly, and most importantly, is the apartment itself. The apartment had everything you could want for your stay, a comfortable bed, a great living area, and so on. Then add in the personal touches left by the host like fresh flowers, coffee, etc., and you can see why I can't recommend Alfredo’s apartment highly enough. I'll certainly not hesitate to stay there again should I return to Montreal in the future.",10.0
"This flat is WAY better than the pictures show. It really felt like home away from home from the moment I walked in. First of all, Alfredo is a wonderful host. He was waiting for me at the flat even though I was running late due to traffic from the airport. A great welcome from him from the moment I walked in. The flat is actually quite large for a single traveller but would be perfect for a couple. Alfredo thought of everything: from a well-stocked kitchen to tons of towels in the bathroom, to cable TV, and even fresh cut flowers! The flat is located minutes away from TONS of bakeries, cafes and restaurants, not to mention the amazing Atwater market. AC definitely helpful during hot summer days. The flat is on two levels located above a pop-up shop; so no noise issues from neighbours. However, it is located right on a busy street; so if you're a light sleeper, highly advisable to bring earplugs. Otherwise, a truly wonderful stay. Thank you Alfredo!",10.0

"Alfredo & his apartment far exceeded all expectations for our trip to Montreal. My husband and I initially booked with another host but after unforeseen circumstances arose, I was left to look for another place to stay while on our way up to Montreal. I reached out to Alfredo and he dropped what he was doing to take us in and make sure that everything was perfect for us! We walked in and were greeted with a cute sign welcoming us and with some Canadian wine. He showed us around and made us feel welcomed right from the start. He even gave us some fresh fruit that he had picked up at the market before we arrived. 

The location of his apartment is perfect! There are so many amazing restaurants and bars within walking distance. My favorite was the ice cream shop - La Diperie. The subway is also just five minutes away, which was so convenient for getting into the city! The apartment itself was super clean and has everything you could need. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were so soft. Stop searching now and book with Alfredo! I definitely will the next time we are in Montreal.",10.0
Alfredo is a Superhost. His unit is my home away from home. He is very hospitable and pays great attention to detail. The unit is well maintained and has complete amenities.

"The place is very comfortable and spacious; not fancy but the decor and layout really work and are very comfortable, with many thoughtful touches.  The stairs were no problem for us and most people, but could be a challenge for someone with limited mobility. 

We loved the location. Within a few blocks we went to the Atwater Market, which is great. The bakery across the street is fantastic. We liked brunch at the place next door and dinner at both restaurants within a block or two.

The metro is only a few blocks away and the 35 bus going to the old town right in front.

We didn't meet Alfredo in person, but he was very prompt in communications and accommodating to our needs.

In Montreal, we really enjoyed Bota Bota and the light show at the Botanical Gardens.",10.0

The place itself exceeded all expectations with a great bedroom, a nice living room, and even a patio out back. Lots of fresh towels and the place was sparkling clean. 

I would definitely stay again in a heartbeat!",10.0

"The loft is perfect for a couple or two couples to spend a night or a week, or even longer. The kitchen is equipped well enough to cook if necessary, and the washer/dryer in the unit was the perfect thing for us halfway through our trip to do a couple loads of laundry.  The bathroom is large and has a pleasant rain shower stall with a skylight in it. Beds were comfy and clean, although it is a loft so be aware that there are no doors to the bedrooms, but they are large enough and located so that there is privacy. The neighborhood is a mix of shops and some restaurants and bars, but was never loud at night.  The subway is a short two-block covered walk away and gives you access to downtown in 10-15 minutes. Overall, it's a great place for a couple to explore Montreal.",9.0

"Lovely spacious loft, nice location - walking distance to Little Italy. To get downtown or Old Montreal you need to take a metro though or drive. It is listed as having parking, however, parking is in the back alley on the parking lot of a store above which the loft is located. To get to the car you have to go around the block. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the maid who was unsure about the parking situation. It did get sorted out quickly enough. The loft has a nice rooftop patio but we weren't able to use it since there is a constant noise from the store's big AC units located right next to the patio. Also, in the bathroom we had 4 little bottles of body lotion and 5 little bottles of conditioner, but no shampoo or body wash - we had to get our own. The host was slow to respond, I was using SMS so maybe it's a problem with the app. Overall, we had a pleasant stay (3 nights).",9.0

Lots of great restaurants in the neighborhood as well.
FYI - there aren't currently curtains on the back windows, taking away from complete privacy, but there are spaces that provide that if needed (ex bathroom).

I would recommend that she install cover plates around all electrical outlets, both on the walls and ceilings (for obvious safety concerns).  It would have been nice to have doors on both of the bedrooms for privacy. The location is by far the best part about this place. Doris was slow to communicate and disorganized regarding the pickup of the keys and parking location.

The condo looked like the pictures but not exactly as luxurious and spacious as pictured. Also, be aware that there are no blackout blinds (for people who like to sleep in complete darkness like me :( and the stairs are pretty steep and difficult to maneuver. We rented the condo for a girls' getaway weekend and had a pretty rough time trying to get the luggage up and down the stairs! There is a TV, but no cable, so if you want to watch TV at all or play music, you will need to use your own Netflix account (as we did). Overall, a pretty good value.",9.0
"True to the pictures, the loft was spacious and clean with beautiful comfortable modern decor. The outside area was a welcome bonus. Check-in and check-out was very simple via the staff at the furniture store below. There is parking in the back of the store which was free, convenient, and safe. The neighborhood was active yet quiet, with many shops and restaurants lining the street. The host was friendly and responsive to any questions we had. There are a few maintenance issues that need to be addressed (various outlet covers & electrical covers & a broken handle on the freezer) however, none of them interfered with our visit. I would highly recommend this loft for your visit to Montreal.",9.0

The apartment is clean, well stocked and really nicely decorated. There is a cool terrace out the back and a really nice shower with a skylight. It is a bring your own bedroom door duration so just remember that if you want privacy. All in all a fantastic place, we would move there!",9.0

"The location of the house is good, on a commercial street with restaurants, bakeries, and small supermarkets nearby. It took some time to find the door and keys, as I had been unable to locate the password box located on the side wall of the building. The house's decor is quite tasteful, but there are leftover electrical connectors that haven't been properly dealt with. Overall, it's relatively clean, but we found garbage in the bathroom trash can that hadn't been emptied. There is a washing machine, and you need to bring your own laundry detergent. The stairs are very steep and narrow, making it difficult to carry heavy luggage. You can park your car for free at the back. In short, it has its pros and cons.",9.0
"Doris Mel's place is amazing, very clean, beautiful decor, and a large space as well.

The location was perfect, with lots of shops and restaurants nearby, including a grocery store and pharmacy. The stairs are a bit tight, but it's okay with small luggage; however, it might be difficult with large suitcases. Otherwise, the place was great, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back! Thanks!!",9.0
"Let me first of all say that we would definitely stay here again. It was clean, great location, FREE parking in the back (though the back is not easily accessible), the owner was very responsive, and the location was great. A few things to mention would be that the bedrooms do not have doors so if you are needing privacy, you would have to be mindful of this. Also, the listing doesn't show the stairs leading from the main entrance. What you see in the photos are the stairs in the rear that lead to the roof down below. If you have difficulty climbing very steep stairs as we did (grandmother) then it's quite an inconvenience. Though it would be fine otherwise. 

I did like the fact that it's close to a ""Jean Cotou"" store so you can get all your toiletries there. It's 1 min walking distance along with other little stores and restaurants. If you're a coffee drinker, ""Caffelinni"" is 3 mins away walking which we enjoyed. Free parking (in the back) was a huge plus since parking in Montreal can get pricy. That alone adds a lot of value to the overall cost of the place. We were able to Uber when needed and drive to other places if we wanted without having to worry about garage fees. 

So overall, we were more than satisfied with the place and thankful to the owners for letting us stay there.",9.0
"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great. Doris Mel responded quickly and made our experience smooth and easy. Although the stairs were a bit steep... her space is beautiful, spacious, and decorated as pictured... the washer/dryer and parking area were a plus! She’s a great host!",9.0

"Initially, I was very pleased with Doris Mel's responsiveness when we booked the flat. She was very pleasant and said she would get in touch closer to check-in. I didn't hear from her so I followed up two days before and she told me she would share the key code with me the day before. I didn't receive the code. I sent her a message early in the morning of check-in, but didn't get a response. Then, I continued to message as we got closer, but still nothing. I read in reviews that she had a furniture shop shown in the pictures, so when we arrived, I went into the store, but she wasn't there. Someone at the store knew the code for the key, so we were able to self-check in. I sent Doris Mel another message asking where to park and she replied apologizing for a problem with the Airbnb app. I never received any information from her about the apartment, the key code, wifi password, check-out, so we guessed our way through. The apartment is very spacious and nice but it had some quirks. The street the flat is located on is a mixed bag of shops and feels more urban than the rest of the area. I love Jean Talon and Little Italy, so I was happy to be so close and parking was a bonus, but that was a little awkward too.",9.0
"This is a modern luxurious flat just like the review claims. The location is on a vibrant and fun retail street (although the apartment is high up and completely quiet). There is a steep walk up to the apartment so if you have a disability this would be difficult.  The host was pleasant, patient, and nice, I think like all Canadians.",9.0
"We had a fantastic time at the loft and truly wish we had another night there!! The space is modern, open, clean, with an exposed wooden wall on the back side. Very neat. There are no doors so it's a great place to hang out and float around with friends. It was close to good dinner options and also 5 minutes to the Beaubien stop on the orange line of the metro. The neighborhood is quirky and cute and definitely worth staying here! Thanks for the great stay!!",9.0
"I liked the housing and its location near all services. However, it is clear that no one lives in this housing and we have the impression of being in a hotel apartment. It's not very serious, but personally, I am less enthusiastic. The kitchen accessories are not of good quality and there is only the essentials. Otherwise, the housing is well decorated and parking behind is really very convenient.",9.0
"The place is really pretty and looks exactly like the picture. The only problem is communication with the host. It's best to talk to the host before you arrive. The stairs to the top condo are a little hard for heavy cases. The location is good and the rooms are clean and comfortable to stay in. In summary, it was a pretty good experience for me and my friends, and we would recommend this place to other friends.",9.0
"Very nice place as described in the pictures. Could use a bit more kitchen utensils and basics like salt, pepper, sugar etc and some bedside lamps. 
We did miss having a little guide as we used to have in our previous rentals for best places to go in the area for food, visits etc to get more of a local feel. 
Nonetheless we’ve had a lovely stay and although we didn't meet Doris, she was very responsive at all times. We definitely recommend this place for its central location",9.0
"What an amazing place and location!

Photos are totally accurate, the place is just awesome for the price. very spacious and my girlfriend and I had a wonderful time here while we stayed in Montreal for New Years.

Totally walking distance to everything and right in the middle of the two best neighborhoods in Montreal!

Thank you guys!

"Doris is super responsive, and her place was very nice and in a great location.",9.0
"Exactly as shown. Very clean. Spectacular neighborhood, the strip was like Christmas again. It was a bit difficult to find because the number wasn't visible on the front. Free parking but it was really hard to find. The parking is located on the street before the actual address. We drove around at least 3 times before we figured it out. At least 15-20 minutes from downtown. If you have a heavy suitcase or luggage, the stairs won't be your best friend. You cannot, I repeat cannot enter from the back, so you have to park and walk around to the front. I would only suggest a mat at the front door for our shoes, especially because it was winter, hand soap and hand towel to dry our hands would be nice. Overall, my friends and I had a great stay and would revisit Montreal. It was great, I will return in warmer weather because there's so much I didn't get to do.",9.0
"Well located, decorated. Everything is open air, though. Doris was a very good host! :)",9.0
"It looks exactly like the pictures, very artistic and rustic with a hint of industrial decorations. The aesthetics of this place are just perfect. Doris was very nice and patient with me since it was my first time renting an apartment and I had lots of questions lol. I'm glad with my experience with her.",9.0
"Thanks for hosting us! We had such a beautiful visit to Montreal!! The apartment was safe, clean, and quiet. It was easy to pick up & drop off keys. The area was cute. Lots of little shops around. It's above a storefront and very close to grocery stores, restaurants, and the metro. We bought a 3-day metro pass and found it very easy to jump on the subway to get downtown, to Old Montreal, and to Mont Royal. Our host was extremely quick at responding to any questions. The bedrooms have no doors. This wasn't a big issue for us in the end, but was a bit surprising. Can't wait to come back and visit again!!",9.0
"Modern loft, well-equipped and well-located, exactly as described.",9.0
Had a great time! Mel was very responsive and helpful.,9.0
"The apartment is very clean - I've stayed in 20+ Airbnbs and this was probably the cleanest. It is spacious without clutter. Although it would sleep and provide plenty of space for two couples, I found the single couch to be a limiting factor for comfort seating. We visited in March with temps in the 30's with our two-year-old - the apartment was plenty warm and very quiet. It's a short walk to the metro and bus - there is a great little grocery store a couple doors down and an excellent bodega selling regional craft beer. Plenty of restaurants are within walking distance or a short metro ride away. It was a great ""neighborhood"" experience in Montreal.",9.0
"Beautiful condo located on a busy shopping street, with many great food options nearby and the metro station just 3 minutes away.",9.0
"Good place. Looks exactly like the pictures... just be advised, there aren't any doors on the rooms except the bathroom. So, if you want to be romantic with your spouse and you have company in the other room it's a bit risky. Haha

Aside from that, the touch of wood made it feel like home. Shops are just down the street and there is decent nightlife. A few bars with good drinks and surprisingly not overpriced. Overall experience was good. She responds fast like she's attached to the phone and is very helpful. Couldn't ask for a better host.",9.0
"Doris Mel's place was perfect for our stay! It was clean, stylish, and comfortable. Doris Mel was quick to respond to questions about check-in and check-out which made the process super easy!

"Nothing negative! The host responds very quickly to messages, the place is exactly as in the photos. Lack of nothing, draps and pillows in extra in the condo even. Comfortable beds and a few minutes from the metro and city center. Really great!",9.0
"Doris' place is very clean, nicely appointed, has air conditioning (very important in the summer months) and a free parking spot. Unfortunately when I was looking at the map, I didn’t notice how far away the condo is from downtown so we spent a lot more time on the metro than we’re used to. We like to walk everywhere, but it wasn’t possible to walk to where we were spending our days (Old Port and downtown). If you’re planning to spend more time by Jean Talon Marketplace and in Old Italy, this is a great place to stay. Overall, we loved the condo and the fact that we didn’t have to worry about our car the whole time we were there, but the location was just too far away for us.",9.0
"Overall, this is a good place and we had a nice stay. The space looks exactly like the photos, and it’s a perfectly sized apartment in my opinion. There are a few great bars and restaurants within blocks. The bed was comfortable. 

The main thing lacking was communication. The hosts never responded to my messages on Airbnb asking about check-in, all the way till the morning of our arrival. I texted both numbers listed in the House Manual and one of them finally answered hours before we got there. Doris was helpful and friendly over text but I wish there would’ve been better communication from the beginning and throughout our stay. On our last day, I asked about the details of checking out (wanting to know if we had to do anything specific before we left), but I never got an answer, so we just kind of guessed.

Other things to note: This is definitely more of a businesslike Airbnb, rather than someone’s actual home. I think they could use a fan in the bedroom. We weren’t sure if the towels or linens were 100% clean. The TV doesn’t have cable and you’d need to bring your own HDMI cord if you want to connect your computer to it. WiFi was good. Neighborhood is kind of a funny mish-mash of shops, but it has its charms. Parking spot was ideal.

If host communication improves, I would recommend this place!",9.0
"Nice location, and easy access to downtown with the Metro nearby. Nice home.",9.0
"The apartment is stylish and clean. The staff at the furniture store, which belongs to the same owner as the apartment, was very helpful in guiding us through check-in.

"Doris Mel's place was great, just as in the pictures. Very stylish and clean. I can't say enough good things about the neighborhood, we had so much fun exploring the area. It's also a quick walk to the metro station to get access to the other parts of the city. The parking behind the unit was a huge plus. We just parked the car and left it there for the duration of our stay (we were on a road trip). Also, the in-unit washer and dryer were huge for us because they allowed us to pack light. There's a full-sized supermarket a couple of blocks away where you can stock up on supplies. Thanks Doris Mel!",9.0

"Nice place, not so easy to find the entrance",9.0
"You can't go wrong with Doris' place. The neighborhood is fantastic, you're a short walk to the metro, and the apartment is very comfortable. The air conditioning was a lifesaver, and since there are no doors on the bedrooms the air circulates well to cool the entire apartment. For coffee drinkers, there's a Keurig coffeemaker but the closest stores don't carry the pods. We found the pods at Marché Station 54 near the Rosemont metro.",9.0
"Perfect location, nice apartment well-equipped and easy to live in with an outdoor patio. 

No doors inside make intimacy a little difficult.

"The apartment was very nice and clean. The unit itself was surprisingly quiet given how lively the area was. The location was great, and would definitely recommend this place for other travelers.

However, communication could have been better. We were not made aware that there were two lockboxes (one for us, the other for the unit next door also rented out by the same host). We spent a lot of time trying to open up the wrong lockbox, as the other one was on a side wall which wasn't very noticeable (especially at night). Our calls/texts/messages to the host were not getting a response. The neighbors also came out to try and help us, and it took all five of us another 10 minutes of trying to reach the host before the neighbors noticed another lockbox on the side wall. This was the only time I've ever been frustrated with an Airbnb check-in process.

I'd still recommend this place, as it was very nice and reasonably priced. However, I would suggest that you get all of the detailed instructions from the host before the check-in date to avoid any issues.",9.0
"Beautiful apartment in a very nice part of the city; great vibes from the neighborhood! Tons of food places right in the market area, hard to beat the location. The place was nice and clean and well stocked with extra pillows and blankets and towels. The shower was very nice and modern with a skylight which was nice. There is a very nice seating area out back that didn’t sound too great in the reviews but it's actually a great space my friends and I enjoyed relaxing out back there",9.0

"This is a pretty cool place to stay, but there are a few things that could be improved upon, and a few things that should be mentioned. 

Some of the windows don't have curtains, which can make it awkward after dark. There was no hand soap or hand towel in the bathroom, and there were only three towels for the four of us. There are also 35 narrow steps to haul your suitcases up; not a problem if you're young and strong. This rental is very open concept, with no doors on the bedrooms, and one open to the living room.

On the plus side, it was super clean, the bed linens were crisp and clean, and the furniture was in excellent condition. Very stylish place!",9.0

"A cute and very clean little apartment within walking distance of the Beaubien metro station. Very clean and a great base for walks to Jean-Talon, Mile End, Plateau, Little Italy and other great areas. Would recommend!

Also, if you are planning to cook for yourself (we didn't) you should bring some basic supplies with you. Overall, a lovely place for a short trip to Montreal!",9.0

"Very clean and up-to-date. It was a pretty good stay because of that, but it was difficult to find the place and parking in the back alley. It was also difficult to decipher what the host expected the place to look like or anything. There was no reassurance from the host whether or not everything was going okay. If you're looking for the least amount of communication and just a clean place to stay for the night, this is it for you. Unfortunately, it made our experience less of an experience because it was a trip for a group of us and we didn't get any recommendations or anything from the host.",9.0
"One of the best places to stay in Montreal, as everything is close by. All kinds of shops and restaurants are close to the location. My recommendation is to go for it.",9.0
"The apartment is extremely clean, well-designed, warm, and well-maintained. Additionally, communication with Doris was flawless, and I had no problems checking in or out. I didn't give it five stars because basic items like soap or coffee that I generally expect in many Airbnbs were missing for me. Furthermore, the extremely steep and narrow staircase was a little concerning, especially when walking in the dark. Otherwise, highly recommended.",9.0

There was no soap in the entire apartment, and also no hand towels, which was a minor inconvenience. 

But otherwise, it's a great spot, and I would recommend!",9.0
"Had a wonderful stay in this conveniently located and well-decorated unit.

"This place was great for our family of four as it was cozy, comfortable, and clean! The entire suite is spacious and there are two separate rooms with two large beds (although there are no doors separating the spaces, so if you have snorers, you'll still hear it) and a nice living room area with a TV. Doris was very responsive to my texts whenever I had any questions and was wonderful to speak with! Just note that parking is just street parking, so you will have to pay out of pocket.",9.0

"Overall, I enjoyed my stay; the only problem I had was with the front glass door being broken (you can reach the lock from outside because the glass is all broken, which also means anyone can come in) and glass was all over the front entrance.

Only reasons for 4 stars instead of 5: parking was very far from the entrance, we had to walk down a back alley at night with the road completely iced over with our luggage and there were no doors on the two rooms so don't expect great privacy. But a great launching pad in Montreal and beautiful decor!",9.0

"When we arrived at the apartment, we discovered there was no key in the lock box. Multiple calls, texts, and messages to the host were not answered.

If the host had answered the phone and given us the code to the lock box containing the key everything would have been fine. When I attempted to call the host the next morning she hung up on me and all subsequent calls went directly to voice mail. RENT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!",9.0

We were there during a heat wave, and we noticed with the bedroom door closed the bedroom was stuffy, but that was solved the next night by leaving the door open. I opted to park curbside and received a parking fine, not realizing it was illegal there. Next time I would pay to park in the garage.

"Parking is available on site, with a fee required due to the city's high density. It's located below the high-rise apartment building and can be a little confusing at first. You must exit the drive ramp when you arrive as you won't have the code card yet to scan. Once you do, it's easy in and out. Little extras in the apartment make it comfortable and clean. This was our first Airbnb experience and we had a good one. We walked everywhere but public transportation would also get us there.",10.0

It was in a great location close to Lucien L’Allier and Guy Concordia Métro stations and just around the corner from the 747 airport bus stop. Despite being next to a busy highway and a fairly busy railway line, there were no issues with noise at all (thanks to the good windows). Only a 5-minute walk to St Catherine Street and a maximum of 20-minute walk to downtown.

If I'm back in Montréal, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!",10.0

Thanks to the hosts.",10.0
"Sarah was a lifesaver. Our original booking got canceled very close to our travel date. Sarah was very responsive and helpful in coming to our rescue. We then experienced another uproar with Airbnb themselves, and Sarah had our back the entire time. I am very thankful for what she did and provided us with during our stay. We walked to Old Montreal, all through St Catherine. And everything was close if you didn't mind the walk. Being 10 minutes from the Bell Centre, which was our main reason for our trip, was amazing. We felt very safe during our stay, and would highly recommend this space. And we will definitely check for availability on our next trip.",10.0

The flat is very spacious and provided with everything you might need both for short-term and long-term stays: plenty of towels, soap, shampoos and conditioners, pans and pots, coffee maker, hair dryer...

The bed was comfortable, and the WIFI was fast and efficient. It is a great find in a super location!",10.0
"Jade's apartment is just as charming as it seems in the photos, and she is so communicative and helpful. She even left us a two-page, handwritten guide of things to do, see, and eat in Montreal. 

Her kitchen has everything you'd need to cook (go to Jean Talon Market for the freshest produce imaginable, and excellent cheese). Her street is lovely and convenient. Just a few blocks from Juliette et Chocolat on St Laurent, where you can get the very best dark hot chocolate ever. A short walk to several buses and a metro, and a slightly longer walk to Mont Royal Park, the Quartier Des Spectacles, and to the McCord and Beaux Arts museums. 

The bed is comfortable. The balcony is perfect for morning coffee (though we never ended up sitting out there because we had breakfast out every day). The neighborhood seemed really quiet while the students were gone, though got louder the last night we were there as the school year seemed to have started again.

I would absolutely stay here again.",10.0

The loft had a comfy sleeping area; a comfy desk and chair for working; a beautiful view of the backyard garden through a big window; a skylight to gently wake you in the morning; a nice, clean bathroom; a kitchen with two stove tops (no oven) where one can do decent cooking—it was all that I was looking for. The loft is quite compact but very functional and beautiful, it worked perfectly for me. PLUS the location - Duluth Avenue, St. Denis Street, La Fontaine Park, Mont Royal Park, etc., are all steps away or within easy reach. PLUS the host - Laurel was so thoughtful, responsive, helpful, and kind. I recommend this place with no hesitation.",10.0
"I loved staying here. It's super cozy and the location is fantastic, just one street away from a bunch of bars and restaurants! 

Laurel, even though I didn't get to meet her face-to-face, was highly available, accommodating, and very friendly.

Keep in mind this place is tiny!! I do not recommend it for people who like to hang out in the apartment too much. I would highly recommend it for people like me who spend most of their time out and about and just need a nice cozy place to lay their head down for the night. 

If I go back to Montreal, I hope to stay there again.",10.0

However, please keep in mind that the home is not air-conditioned, and it's located next door to a charming BYOB restaurant. The latter has outdoor seating in the back during warm months, so there is some outside noise until about 11 or so on weeknights and until about midnight on Saturday.",9.0

The only thing we were not satisfied with about the house, although we knew the owners lived there, was that we felt like we didn't have enough space to store our personal belongings in the kitchen and bedroom. And the owners didn't go the extra mile to make us feel welcomed like the other houses we stayed in during this trip. 

Overall, a good stay.",9.0

"The host was argumentative when I told her there were no drinking glasses in the kitchen. She expected me to use one of the tiny little espresso cups. There was a sink full of dirty dishes from the time I got there until the time I left. We found a dead mouse on the kitchen counter one day. The bathroom sink was disgusting when I got there but cleaned, but not well, a couple days later. The outside door was not just unlocked but open when I got there because it was broken. It was fixed a couple days later. There were new windows being put in the week I was there. She failed to tell me that until after I was there. The workmen were there too early in the morning for me and made a lot of noise which affected my sleep. You needed to take a long bus ride to get to the grocery store. Luckily, there was a well-stocked variety store just minutes away.",9.0

Convenience store within 1 block of apartment for essentials. 
Subway, Indian and Vietnamese restaurants about 1 mile walk.
I had cool roommates during my stay so hopefully you will too.

A small caveat nonetheless, the cleanliness of communal spaces depends on the different roommates (kitchen, bathroom).

Not living in this apartment herself, Caroline is very responsive to any message or call... And how can you ignore her kindness and especially her concern for ensuring your well-being? Impossible.

"Everything was absolutely perfect! Rafa is an exceptional person, very easy to get in touch with and always respectful of any questions. The experience was great, the location of the apartment is perfect, close to good restaurants, a nice park for walking and biking. The studio is pleasant and easily accessible by public transport. I recommend it to everyone on Airbnb.",10.0
We had a good stay at Rafael's. He is very easy to communicate with as his co-host. They provided us with everything we needed to enjoy our stay. I would recommend staying at Rafael's.,10.0
"Overall, this is a great place to stay! The hardest part was figuring out where to park. It's easier to find a spot on weekends, but I don't know where we would have parked if it was a weekday. Once we were settled though, my husband and I loved the apartment! We were able to cook there and it was a good size for two people. There is a big park right across the street that was nice to walk in, and if you want to, you could walk to downtown and save the hassle of driving. Rafael was also a great host and was very quick about responding to questions we had! He also left some snacks out for us and made staying there easy. I would highly recommend it if you're looking for an affordable place to spend the night and explore the city during the day.",10.0

Would recommend to any of my friends & would definitely stay there again if possible.",10.0

The room is very spacious as well as the bathroom and the bed is really comfortable. There are many shops nearby and it's therefore very easy to stock up or just go out for dinner.

I must admit that I was a little sad to leave because it was so enjoyable living there!",10.0

Zhen and his family were very welcoming during my stay. 

Bathroom door doesn't fully close, but was no issue as the suite is separate from the floors below.

I went for long walks. There are lots of nice restaurants in the area. Also close to buses and metro. The room and bathroom were spacious, and the listing was accurate.",10.0
"Shereen's place is the ideal spot for experiencing Montreal. The apartment is immaculate with easy access to two metro stops, the Atwater market, the canal, and a Bixi bike hub around the corner. Her recommendations are perfect for enjoying the city and nice additions like Netflix access, the gym, and on-street parking make the apartment a top-notch experience.",10.0
"Shereen's place is beautiful! Sparkling clean, beautifully decorated, and the rooftop terrace was incredible.

This is a lovely place - everything is just as it appears in the photos! The building and amenities are great - especially the rooftop pool and seating areas.,10.0
"Shereen was very helpful with restaurant and entertainment recommendations, and her place was beautiful and clean, just as the photos showed. There was one surprise that the photos showed, but I didn't realize until we arrived - the large windows don't have any curtains. If you are a morning person, this is lovely, but it makes sleeping in difficult when the sun rises so early.",10.0
Shereen's place was great and just as beautiful as the pictures. She made us feel very comfortable and gave us really good suggestions on things to do and see.,10.0
Awesome place looks exactly like the pictures!,10.0
"Shereen's place was really great. Overall, a 10 out of 10. The condo was as advertised in the photos, but pictures don't do the bed and shower justice.  The memory foam bed was very comfortable and the shower has some serious pressure. Easy kitchen in which to cook, and the wifi was very reliable. Only ""hang ups"" were with check-in (had to pull bed sheets/pillow cases out of the dryer and put them on bed/pillows myself) and parking, from time to time. While parking is, in fact, free, it's not entirely hassle-free. To Shereen's credit, though, she makes this known in her condo's listing. Parking in front of the condo is nearly always filled up. On Rues Bourget, Irene, Sainte-Antoine, and Sainte-Jacques (four main streets near the condo) you don't have to pay to park, but you're not allowed to park during certain weekly times. For example, on the north side of Rue Bourget (right in front of the building) you'll be ticketed if your car is parked between 8 and 11:30 am. Then, on the opposite side of the street, you're forced to move your car on Tuesdays from noon to 3:30 pm. Moral of the story? Come enjoy Shereen's awesome condo, just don't bring a car. You can Uber anywhere from her centrally-located spot in less than ten minutes for about ten bucks. Overall, an awesome stay and I look forward to being back.",10.0
"Shereen's place was bright and clean. Close walking distance to Metro. The rooftop pool was nice, however the gym was across the street in a different building. 
If you're looking to be a little outside of the downtown core this place is perfect.",10.0
This is a fabulous place if you want to combine a busy city weekend with some relaxing time by the pool. Very cool indeed.,10.0
"My accommodation is identical to the photos shown in the listing: beautiful. The neighborhood is quiet and super nice!  Regarding Shereen, she is very kind.

"There's nothing you won't like about the design and furniture of this place. Beautiful. It's like a 10-minute walk to the nearest metro station. Also around a 15-minute walk to St. Catherine which is a main spot for tourists. The building is very nice. Shereen was so sweet, I met with her when checking in and she was willing to help with everything I had, lovely lady!",10.0
"The place is great, it really is as advertised in photos. The curtains are the only thing I can think of as a slight negative. They are a bit too thin. They let a lot of light in, and you may need to get dressed in the bathroom if you have some privacy concerns. The apartment has everything you may need. Shereen responds fast if you have any questions. Overall, we were very happy.",10.0
"Shereen's place is exactly(!) as pictured and was perfect in terms of design and layout. Extremely clean and spacious, with a pleasant view of the street and plenty of natural light. Shereen herself was as pleasant, responsive, and helpful as any Airbnb host with whom I've ever stayed - she gave great tips on both the surrounding neighborhood and city as a whole. Finally, I loved the gym (across the street) and rooftop lounge area - peaceful with amazing views.",10.0
"Shereen's place is a nice cozy studio. It felt very homey and looked amazing, the pictures don't do it justice! Shereen is a great host. She was flexible with our check-in/check-out time.

I would highly recommend staying here and would love to visit again.",10.0
"Centrally located on a quiet street in one of Montreal's trendiest neighborhoods, Shereen was very accommodating and the bed was super comfortable!",10.0
Shereen was extremely helpful with giving us information for our stay. Her place was kept very clean and it's a very nice quiet atmosphere.

"Great place. 10-minute walk to Lionel-Groulx metro station. Very clean and quiet. Washer/dryer in unit works well. Host was very responsive. I texted her that the internet was down, and 2 minutes later she was on the phone with the provider, and service was restored within 10 minutes.",10.0

We had a mini road trip and decided to stay in Montreal for 2 days. The place was very clean and tidy. It was close to the places we wanted to visit. Shereen was very responsive to answer all of our questions. We enjoyed our stay there. Thank you.,10.0
"This place was absolutely GORGEOUS. Everything you could hope for in an Airbnb. The pictures are absolutely true to what it is! If anything, they undersell the spacious, luxurious nature of this loft. Shereen was the most gracious host! She accommodated our check-in time and responded within minutes of messages. The apartment is incredible - big ceilings, clean, fabulous kitchen and bathroom!  It is so open and warm (quite literally, toasty with the heating system!). She has all necessary kitchen items/utensils needed - plates, dishes, knives, pots and pans, etc. The gym was gorgeous - a room for floor work (the yoga room) equipped with weights, mats, kettlebells, etc. as well as multiple cardio machines, weight machines available in the main gym space. 

Truly, there is little you could want or need for at this place. Parking was so easy and the area is great with tons of lovely restaurants, easy access to groceries, and very accessible to downtown Montreal.",10.0
"Very nice unit in a great location. 
Perfect for one person or a couple.
Shereen was quick to respond to messages and made me feel very welcome. 

Parking is free in some areas on the street, however you will have to move your car daily depending on the section of the road. 

The building was very safe, the amenities were as expected and the unit was nice and tidy.

It was a great spot, definitely recommend it!",10.0
"Shereen's place was clean and stylish. It had everything I needed except parking. When the listing said ""free parking on premises,"" I assumed that meant there was parking on the property, but apparently it means there is some free street parking on the adjacent streets. However, the signage was confusing for a non-local and I had trouble finding parking on multiple occasions (especially if I arrived later in the evening). Other than that, everything else was good. The pool was closed. The gym was across the street and looked decent but I didn't end up using it.",10.0

"This is a cozy, comfortable basement suite in a quiet residential area of Montreal (NDG). Sakina is an attentive hostess, very responsive by text both before and during our stay. There is free parking on site behind the building, which was great. We really enjoyed exploring the neighborhood, and it is a short walk to the number 105 bus which links to the metro system. There is also a small fridge and microwave, which we did not expect but of course were very appreciated. Our party was 2 adults and 3 kids, and there was plenty of space for all of us.",10.0
"We were delighted with Sakina's basement apartment. It was clean and spacious, private, with two decent-sized bedrooms and a very large living/dining/common room, and a locking door separating it from the rest of the house.

"Sakina's place was great and just what we needed. We were traveling with a single person and a couple so we needed two bedrooms and a common space, and this worked out perfectly. We had a nice couch to relax on and watch TV, along with a table and chairs for eating. Sakina even left us a variety of breakfast food, which was a nice surprise. There was a fridge and microwave as well. The apartment was very clean and quiet, and she left plenty of amenities like shampoo, extra blankets, and a hairdryer. The neighborhood is quiet and residential, and it's a short drive from the city center not far out of the way. One day Sakina asked to borrow a table in our space for a birthday party, and when we came home we found that she had returned the table with slices of cake for us!

Sakina really went the extra mile by helping us recover our youngest daughter's forgotten stuffed animal.

"My wife and I stayed at Sakina's place for 3 nights/4 days. The place was very clean and, for a couple, very spacious. It had the essentials needed for a good stay. We liked that Sakina offered us parking behind the building (her private parking area). There were a couple of things that we didn't like, though. The first one was that Sakina's response time to our messages was not quick. In fact, she never answered the first message we sent her once we were in her property, and she was not prompt to respond to a couple of other messages. The second thing is that the place gets very noisy from around 5am to around 8am. We stayed there during weekdays and in the basement we could hear them getting prepared for their day. In all, we had a good stay, but based on previous reviews we had higher expectations. Thanks.",10.0

"The view from the room is perfect. Jeremy was a fantastic host, highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city!",10.0
"Jeremy was an excellent host, very hospitable. We only stayed two nights to see the sights, events, and nightlife they had going on in Montreal that weekend. The room is a great size for a couple with a closet and its own bathroom. The kitchen is quaint and clean. 

He even gave us a continental-style breakfast the morning after our first stay. He didn't have to, but it's just a testament to how hospitable he is. The room is literally next to the laundry room and pool as listed. The view from his balcony is great. You are right in the center of Montreal near shopping malls, restaurants. His place is right next to a Bixi bike stall for those who like a little workout in the morning.

There's a fan in the room but it never really gets hot considering the draft coming from the balcony. 

Communication-wise, Jeremy is very efficient. He responds within 5-15 minutes. Mind you, you barely see Jeremy unless you have a question or you see him doing upkeep on the place, which is nothing against him, but it shows that you kind of feel alone in the place, which is nice and is probably the idea he was going for.

All in all, I would stay here again and probably will.",10.0
"An absolutely amazing apartment and host. The best ever. JEREMY has not hosted before; however, all hosts can learn from him. His apartment is amazing and you will not need a thing. Everything is provided including laundry detergent. A swimming pool is across the hall and you have no neighbors. An outdoor deck is on the same floor and one above the roof. The views of the city are actually best from the bedroom and the veranda outside the living room. JEREMY will be seeing me again.",10.0
"We enjoyed Jeremy's penthouse. The bedroom was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the towels and linens were high-end. Great views of the city! We visited in the summer and the room was a little warm, with no AC, but fans are available and with the windows open you can get a good cross breeze. Close to the metro and lots of restaurants. Jeremy is very considerate and helped me settle into the city.",10.0

Jeremy has been helpful, friendly, and accommodating! He provided light breakfast (bagels, orange juice, fruits). Tea and coffee are available in the kitchen whenever you like.

"We had a wonderful stay! Very nice, clean bedroom attached to a bathroom with shower, and well-stocked kitchen (we cooked a meal and enjoyed the complimentary fruit and bagels for breakfast). We loved the pool across the hall!! The mattress is on the firmer side which wasn't ideal for my partner (who has spinal disc pain) but it felt totally normal to me and I slept very nicely. The comforter is VERY cozy and the blackout shades were great. There is absolutely no street noise and there are restaurants, grocery stores, a mall, and a metro station in the area that we made full use of. In fact we took many recommendations from Jeremy's wonderful guide!! I would highly recommend this place!!!!",10.0

"The view from Jeremy's place is just amazing! Very easy self-check in with well laid-out instructions. Located right downtown close to lots of restaurants, things to do, and the metro to get a little further away - we didn't use our car at all the 2 days we visited, so having the parking spot available was great. The floor is high up enough that street noise is not a problem. Having a private bathroom is always great. Very clean throughout and Jeremy was very accommodating. We had a great time.",10.0

"Great location - <10 minute walk to a metro station, 1 block from a grocery store, with numerous restaurants and cafes nearby. The penthouse view is stunning, and the space has everything you need. Even though it's a shared space, Jeremy makes it feel very welcoming. The rules and boundaries of the space are clearly communicated, so you know what is acceptable and what is not, which I found helped me feel less like a guest.",10.0
The host cancelled this reservation 83 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,10.0

Communication with Rina and her brother Joss was easy, and they were very attentive to making sure we had what we needed for a great stay. Joss lives upstairs in a different unit, so he was close by when we had questions (of which we had only one, regarding the TV). 

We'd definitely stay again!",10.0

"If you are taking a trip to Montreal, you absolutely have to stay here at this apartment. It's not only that it's a fantastic apartment and near the Metro; it's also quiet and very roomy, perfect for a solo traveler, couple, or group. What makes it truly special is the host, Therese, who is absolutely outstanding. She met me for check-in after 3am because of traffic. She made sure I had everything I needed. She even made authentic Pho and another Vietnamese traditional soup. She showed me the sights of the city and told me about the ones she thought I should see without her when she had errands. I told her that I am learning French because I am going to grad school in France next year, and she took the time to give me some pointers. All in all, Therese made the trip to Montreal so much more enjoyable and exceeded expectations.",9.0

"Therese was a wonderful host! The apartment was very clean and spacious, and it was great to have breakfast foods available to fuel up before we headed out to explore Montreal. We only had issues with the wifi being down and there not being air conditioning. Therese was very communicative and gave us some great suggestions for things to do around the city. The location so close to the Metro made getting around the city very easy!",9.0
"Great place and great host, would come back if I go to Montreal again.",9.0
You will not find a cleaner place than Therese's! She was very friendly and accommodating. She suggested places for us to tour in Montreal when our plans got rained out and she has NETFLIX!,9.0
"Therese is a wonderful host. She is very attentive and responsive. Her apartment is sparkling clean, and the king-size bed is high quality and dreamy. 

She is right next door for early or late evening help, and is extremely willing to be of assistance.

Her neighborhood is the most ethnically diverse in Montreal. North African cafes are just down the street. Public bikes are available for rent two blocks away at the Metro station. This is a great place to get a glimpse of how real people live their lives in Montreal. Two thumbs up!",9.0
"Therese was absolutely fantastic! Her place was cozy and cute, exactly what we were looking for. It was a little bit farther away from the main attractions of Montreal than I thought it would be, but the train station is close by and about a 20-minute Uber ride away. The fact that this place had a parking spot for us was so helpful. Therese provided us with great suggestions of things to do and was so flexible with check-in and check-out. Would definitely recommend this place for your stay. Thanks!",9.0
"The place is as advertised, cozy and clean. The host is excellent and thoughtful! Very close to a major subway line - commuting was very easy.",9.0

I highly recommend without hesitation.",9.0

"Peggy and I enjoyed our stay in Montreal to the max in part because of the kindness and warm hospitality of Therese. She readily answered all the questions a typical tourist would ask, such as ""Where can I access the Metro?  Where is the nearest grocery store that has great produce?"" Over and beyond expectations, Therese got our stay off to a great start with breakfast treats. Therese's apartment has excellent location—just a 5-minute walk to the Metro which then gives one access to almost all the tourist destinations. One does not have to remember complicated bus routes in order to get around in Montreal—the Metro is fast, efficient, and inexpensive. We had no need for a car at any time while we were in Montreal. So, I would say to prospective guests, treat yourself to a marvelous stay in Petite-Patrie with Therese.",9.0
It was exactly like the pictures. Very convenient and close to the metro. The parking was very useful. Therese was an awesome host and very helpful!,9.0
"Comfortable and private accommodation. Close to the metro. The lady is very welcoming, helpful, and friendly. It's a whole apartment (private).",9.0
"The pictures of the place are very accurate. One of the great things about this place is that it comes with an actual parking spot, vs on the street (can be difficult to figure out 3 different parking signs on one post). The place was very clean and Therese was able to get us the keys when we arrived. However, the only negative thing I have to say is that the walls are very thin and any noise outside can be heard very clearly inside (only a downside if you're a light sleeper). Therese was a great host and checked in to ensure we had everything we needed. The overall feel of the home was like being a guest in someone else's house, rather than a hotel.",9.0
"We booked Therese's apartment for our trip to Montreal and we were happy that we did. The location worked great for us, Therese was more than perfect communicating with us every time very quickly, and we had a good time there. 

The apartment is as described, a nice modern touch, perfect for a couple, clean, and the fact that there's a reserved parking spot is a very appreciated bonus, saving us big city parking headaches.

You can leave your car there and walk a few minutes to the city's transit, very easy to get to all your favorite spots. And if you don't have a list, Therese will help you with all kinds of ideas. 

A thank you note from both of us to you, Therese.

"The apartment was perfect for one person or a couple. It was bright and clean with a great king-sized bed! Also, it was easy to get to when driving, although it's best to avoid rush hour, but this applies anywhere in Montreal. The subway is just a block away, making it easy to get downtown and back.",9.0
"This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had (and I use it a fair bit!). The spot was well-located, barely a 5-minute walk to St. Michel subway station, which makes it easy to get anywhere in the city. The apartment was incredibly comfortable, with a wonderful big comfy bed, really nice living room/sofa to lounge in and watch Netflix, a nice spacious kitchen, etc. But the best part was the host - Therese was one of the nicest hosts I've met, super-quick with responses and information. We were there over a holiday and she gave lots of information about what was open and what wasn't, even loaned us items for some elaborate cooking we decided to do. Anyway I could go on, but the point is that this was among the best Airbnb experiences I've had - highly recommended! Therese was an amazing host and you will not be disappointed with this place!",9.0
"What a beautiful apartment! We loved our little romantic getaway, it was the perfect nest of love :-)",9.0
"I must admit, there is nothing negative I can say about my experience with Therese and her Airbnb spot. Coming from someone who is somewhat picky about these things, my stay was amazing, from the cleanliness of the place to everything being a walk away to the quick and clear responses and follow-ups from Therese throughout the day to make sure everything was going well and if I needed anything. Parking is super; you have your own spot right in front of the building on private property. You have all the essentials and much more. I have already told Therese how satisfied I was, and the next time I need a getaway to Montreal, her place is most likely the place I would stay without question. I could continue writing nothing but positive things, but if you've read this far, just book Therese's place and enjoy!",9.0
"Therese's place was amazing, and her communication was prompt and so informative. From the moment I booked to the moment I walked through the front door, Therese was so welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed. 

The kitchen was huge and spacious and was stocked with food. In fact, the whole house was actually bigger than I anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise. Best of all: the comfiest bed ever. 

Super pro: the parking spot. Parking in Montreal can be a nightmare. Not here! If you have a car, this is a huge perk and really made coming and going so easy. Location-wise, if you have a car, the house is conveniently situated and not too far from many sights. 

10000% recommend anyone to stay here. It's a gem :)",9.0
We loved this place. It was perfect. Therese thought of every last detail to make our stay great. My only negative point was that we only had 1 fork. But we made do. It was nicely decorated and comfortable. It truly felt like home. We can’t wait to stay again.,9.0

"Great location, spacious apartment. Therese was great at communicating. 

The apartment matched the description. The kitchen could use a couple more items to make it useful, such as a can opener (we borrowed one from them when asked), and a pot for cooking.

It's best to call ahead to ensure parking is available upon arrival.

The metro was needed to get into Old Montreal, but it was very close. The simple apartment was just what we needed when staying two nights. 
I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants value in being in the city without feeling rushed. If we are ever back in Montreal, Therese's place is our first choice for sure!",9.0
"Our stay in Therese's apartment was wonderful! The parking space attached to the home made arrival and check-in easy, and the air conditioning unit in the bedroom was a godsend during the heatwave. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated (with touches like flowers and trays of glassware ready for use), and perfectly sized for the two of us. We also loved the location - a short walk to both the metro and a nearby grocery store. The one issue we encountered was around checkout. When we asked near the beginning of the visit what time we should expect to check out, Therese's answer was an hour earlier than the time listed on the website - which was fine with us, and we planned accordingly. However, on the night before our departure, she sent us a message at 11:30pm asking if we would be able to leave between 8-10am and if we would be able to move the car around the same time. In the end, we left and moved the car only an hour before our planned departure time. Overall, we had a fantastic experience at this Airbnb, but the muddled information about checkout added an extra layer of complication to the end of our stay.",9.0

"We had a fantastic stay at Therese’s place! Fantastic communication beforehand with check-in, tips for during our stay once we arrived, and an easy check-out! The place is very clean and even seemed to be bigger than expected for an apartment in the city! We were also very happy about the private parking space so we didn’t have to worry about our car at all during our trip. Like everyone else has mentioned, this is a short five-minute walk to the metro and will get you anywhere you need to be in the city. Highly recommend staying with Therese!",9.0
"Wonderful, clean apartment! The space was perfect for my little family and me. The dedicated parking space was so appreciated as there was no street parking at all. The Netflix and wifi were perfect, and we also used the clothes washer and dryer. The host did not intrude at all and her family who also live in the building were so nice!",9.0
"Thérèse's apartment offers incredible value for your money! It is incredibly well situated. There is a grocery store around the corner, the Métro is within walking distance, and the highway is close by.  There are also many local restaurants nearby. It is quiet, with friendly but unobtrusive neighbors. 

My wife and I really liked the apartment's layout; it provides privacy between guests if needed. It was clean and nicely decorated. The bed is a comfortable king size. We loved the lounging area with a large, comfortable couch and high-definition TV with Netflix. We were able to prepare and cook meals in the large kitchen. Thérèse was responsive to our messages, referred us to places to go, and was kind enough to offer complementary bottles of water.

I highly recommend Thérèse's place! Thank you, Thérèse!",9.0

Location was great for public transit (<5 minute walk to the metro). The bed was really comfortable, plus my boyfriend loved having the king size bed since he is very tall. Just a tip if you are using the parking space, there is a window to another apartment unit right behind the parking spot so don't back in!",9.0
"Location and neighborhood not great. Smaller than expected and with very small investments could be a lot more inviting. There are a lot of random posters and personal items around the place when it seems like a full-time vacation rental. The host was good and the place was comfortable, but it wasn't near all the things it said it was, and I didn't feel great walking around the neighborhood. I paid less for a much cleaner place in the heart of downtown, but it would be a good place to stay if they were charging less. As is, I wouldn't recommend.",9.0
"One of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. It's a cute little apartment perfect for a couple and close enough to the St. Mitchell metro, which gives you access to the entire city. Access to Netflix was a plus! Therese's list of places to see came very handy. I give the place 5 stars!",9.0

Everything was sparkling clean and as described / shown in the pictures. The building and area were very quiet at night. Although it's not in the heart of downtown, it took no more than 15 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go. Having the smart TV with Netflix was better than cable. The bed was super comfortable as was the living room.

Check-in and checkout was easy and convenient.",9.0

It's in a super quiet and small building so you don't need to worry about noise. A quick 10-minute walk to the subway so Montreal is at your fingertips.

Each room had its own thermostat too, which was helpful while staying here in the cold winter months.

Therese's home is an excellent place to stay if you are driving to Montreal or renting a car. The parking spot made our stay hassle-free and the drive to Downtown and Old Montreal was quick.

"Tristan was an excellent host and created a wonderful space for visitors. Prior to arriving, Tristan was very prompt in responding to my messages and extremely communicative in arranging arrival plans, keys/parking/etc. Tristan greeted us and directed us to the private parking for the apartment, in the rain!!! He was very sweet upon meeting us and walked through the apartment with us as well, making sure we had everything we needed for our stay. During our stay, I had a few questions, he was always available to answer via text and even came up to the apartment. 

The space itself is immaculate. Brand new. Amazing shower, comfortable beds, fresh linens, ample closet space, plenty of towels, kitchen supplies, everything stocked. Simple, yet very thoughtful. Everything you need. 

Thank you Tristan!",10.0

She provided many helpful tips on restaurants and transit, providing us with a print copy of nearby Metro stations. The unit was ample size for the two of us but would comfortably accommodate four guests. The bed was very comfortable. This unit is definitely as advertised, and we second all the great reviews for this location. We would definitely stay here again and hope to return soon. Thanks, Karen!",10.0

"Pros:
-- Located in a pleasant area close to many restaurants and cafes

-- Extremely clean place
-- Easy check-in/check-out

Cons:
-- No air conditioning, provided a fan (but only one fan for two bedrooms)
-- No TV
-- Internet went out a few times during our stay
-- Walls thin; can hear neighbors walking around upstairs at all times
-- Bathroom door sticks and is quite difficult to open/close 

Overall, a nice basic place without the bells and whistles.",10.0

The space itself was clean and had some nice minimalist touches that we liked. We really liked to come back in the afternoon to chat and have coffee in the common areas.",10.0
"Fantastic apartment in a great neighborhood. It's bigger than it looks in the pictures!

I highly recommend this apartment",10.0
"Spacious apartment, clean and well-equipped. 
Comfortable bedding and modern bathroom. A bit far (15-20 min) from the metro but close to buses. 
Pleasant and lively neighborhood. Many restaurants and grocery stores nearby. Private parking space very convenient. 
Tristant is responsive and helpful, excellent communication with him.  
The neighborhood is quiet but you can't fully enjoy it because the acoustic insulation inside the apartment is really bad. It's difficult to close your eyes as the noise from the floorboards of the neighbor above is present throughout the apartment, a shame because everything else is top-notch!",10.0
Pleasant apartment in a very quiet and well-located neighborhood. Excellent welcome,10.0
"A flat in a very nice neighborhood with all the necessary shops nearby, a metro station located 15 minutes walk (blue line - Iberville stop) allowing access to the heart of Montreal without any hassle. Tristan is a very responsive host who lives with his family in the apartment below, so there's an extra layer of security if needed. If I am ever back in Montreal, I will definitely contact Tristan again as he deserves his Superhost status!",10.0
Great comfy place!,10.0
"Very pleasant accommodation
Ideal for 2 couples",10.0
"This is a very cute apartment great for groups! My friends and I enjoyed using this place as a home base during our trip to Montreal. One thing you should consider (if using a car in the winter) is asking if parking will be available before you arrive. Since parking was listed as part of the listing, I assumed we would have parking during our stay. Yet, the parking spot was not cleared when we got to the Airbnb. We were eventually allowed to park in the neighbor's spot. I recommend just asking before you arrive if off-street parking will be available during your trip.",10.0
Perfect,10.0
"The apartment is very functional: there's everything you need to cook, the kitchen is very large, the bathroom perfectly clean, the bed cozy and the little living room, although a bit dark, pleasant. There's even a small courtyard behind with a small table and two chairs. Super nice for being outdoors and quiet. 

Drolet Street is very pretty, flowery, calm, there's a convenience store right at the corner of the street, convenient. And above all, as soon as you walk 3/4 minutes, you reach Duluth Street, Saint Laurent Boulevard and St Denis where life resumes, in bars, restaurants, terraces...

The Plateau neighborhood is lively, but be prepared to meet lots of French people everywhere you go :)

In any case, don't hesitate to book here, your stay will be ideal and Sarah and Aristide are adorable, available and accommodating.",10.0
"It was a really beautiful space, you could tell the hosts put a lot of thought into decorating and furnishing the place because you had everything you could possibly need (including cooking spices, tea and coffee). It was clean, quiet and very well located. Sarah and Aristide were lovely to meet. I was really happy with the accommodation.",10.0
It's exactly as pictured. I was SUPER comfortable during my stay and it has so much character. It's the perfect little place to stay when you come to Montreal.,10.0

"Sarah and Aristide's self-contained apartment was wonderful. Clean, cozy, with access to a beautiful garden and within easy walking distance from a host of beautiful buildings, hundreds of murals, and super independent restaurants, bars, and coffee houses. After 13 hours of travel, it was wonderful to sink into a bath in this rustic building on a quiet street. I heartily recommend this place for a happy, relaxed stay, as well as Sarah and Aristide as warm, welcoming hosts.",10.0
"Sarah and Aristide were great hosts, and the room was especially cozy and quiet. A very cool location, highly recommend staying in Le Plateau if you haven't been to that part of town, a 10-20 minute walk or an 8 minute drive to Main Streets such as St Laurent and St. Catherine.",10.0
We loved our stay at Sarah's apartment! It is close to several types of public transportation and within walking distance of many restaurants and shops. The apartment itself was very clean and full of useful accommodations. Sarah was very thoughtful and quick in her communications. We would stay here again and recommend it to anyone!,10.0
"Great location and value. Close to lots of good shopping, the metro, Schwartz's, and Mount Royal. We were able to walk everywhere (longer walks but quite doable) as this place is well located to many popular sites and great food! The space is very clean, comfortable, and stocked with nice ""extras"" like fresh coffee and tea. Sarah and Aristide were lovely hosts, very open and accommodating, ready to answer all questions and help out with anything in the apartment. Overall, we had a great time and would book here again because of the great hosts and lovely, comfortable, home-like space.",10.0
"After a disastrous experience in a dilapidated student residence in the ""McGill ghetto"", we were delighted to spend two nights in Sarah and Aristide's charming apartment on Plateau, a complete contrast! The area, just steps from St-Louis Square and St-Denis and St-Laurent streets, is a quiet and charming neighborhood where it's nice to live, with more children than cars... The houses all have a certain charm, in their early 20th century urban style. Sarah and Aristide's apartment is located under their residence - so any questions can be immediately addressed with them - on the ground floor of their house. Everything is charming, from brick walls to parquet floors (and sloping!) to cozy and functional furniture. We easily accommodate three people in the apartment thanks to the convertible sofa bed in the small living room. And the apartment also allows cooking and dining. A very good choice!",10.0
"I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun getaway in Montreal. It is conveniently located in the middle of a hip neighborhood filled with great restaurants and coffee shops.

"Excellent housing well equipped and in a great location
I recommend this housing",10.0
"Cute space, cozy and just the right size for two. Our visit coincided with an unprecedented Montréal heat wave, but the apartment was always cool and pleasant to return to. With the windows open, there's some playground, household, and neighborhood noise during the day, but perfectly quiet at night. Easy and charming walk to great restaurants in the neighborhood.",10.0

Sarah and Aristide are very friendly and helpful. 
I definitely recommend this sweet apartment.",10.0
"Comfortable, clean & well-maintained apartment in a quiet residential area, not far from great restaurants. Sarah & Aristide responded quickly to text messages.  The apartment is a ~30 minute walk to Old Town Montreal, McGill University and the fine arts museum; and a ~60 minute walk to a large open-air farmers market in Little Italy area of town.",10.0
"Super accommodation! 
Very well located: close to the Sherbrooke metro station. Mont Royal is a 10-15 minute walk away. 
Easy communication with Sarah and Aristide!! Immediate email response with answers to all our questions. 
The accommodation is very pleasant, top equipment and impeccable cleanliness! 
I recommend it!",10.0
"Very pleasant accommodation. I adore the varnish with this golden color, I find it very warm! Very quiet accommodation: very little traffic on the street and we are a bit set back. As in all buildings of this type, we easily hear footsteps above, but fortunately, this doesn't last long. I haven't had the opportunity to enjoy the backyard. However, I particularly appreciated the cozy nest, the spacious kitchen, the bathtub for relaxation, and the comfortable towels. I also had the luck of finding a free parking spot right in front of the apartment. This allowed me to leave the car all weekend and go into the city center thanks to the metro (the Sherbrooke station is 600m away). In short, very good experience. I recommend!",10.0
"What a wonderful place to stay while traveling in Montreal. 
It is perfect for one person, suitable for two. Also so very close to all that you could want to see in Montreal. Tons of nice cafes on St. Denis for anyone looking to work, and a veryyy comfortable bed. Pleasure to communicate with and very prompt response. Thank you Sarah & Aristide!",10.0
"This is a wonderfully compact, reasonably priced apartment ideally located for visiting Montreal. The street is quiet but within walking distance of great restaurants, parks, and the metro. After a full day of walking, I appreciated the comfortable queen bed with dual reading lights. Sarah and Aristide are responsive hosts, and thoughtfully stocked the kitchen with fresh coffee. If you're arriving by car, make sure to get precise information regarding free street parking - the signage system in Montreal is unique, and parking tickets costly!",10.0
"We had a lovely stay at Sarah's place. The neighborhood is absolutely charming and pretty walkable to everything we wanted to do and see (we put on about 10 miles/day) but in the lovely fall weather and cute streets of the neighborhood and city, we didn't mind walking at all!

Sarah was so friendly and quick to reply to all of our messages - offering suggestions on best places to thrift shop, and tips on finding a free parking spot for the weekend. Definitely appreciated!

The flat itself was very clean and pretty big - had everything my fiancé and I needed; with a very comfortable bed I may add! The only small bump in our stay is that we believe Sarah and Aristide have a small child/children who we heard running around every morning at 7:30/8AM. We love kids, and have a few nieces and nephews ourselves, so we totally understand that they have a LOT of energy in the morning - but a heads up for people who like sleeping in late - this wasn't a huge issue for us as we are fairly early risers, but just worth noting. 

Overall - great first time to Montreal! Would love to come back someday!",10.0

"Sarah and Aristide's apartment was super cute and even larger than it appears in the pictures. The bed was super comfy, everything was spotless and there was coffee and tea for the morning.

"Excellent location and a very nice space for two people. The place was clean throughout and the bed was very comfortable. Coffee and tea were available which we enjoyed very much. If it is dark out when you arrive, watch for the stairs into the home as they begin quickly. We loved our stay and sincerely hope to be back!",10.0
"This is a great, garden-level apartment in the Plateau-Mont-Royal neighborhood. If you enjoy exploring cities by foot, this is perfectly situated near Mile End, Mont-Royal, Boulevard St Laurent, Rue Saint-Denis and so much more. It's also a quick walk to the Sherbrooke metro station and you are surrounded by bus routes, making the entire city very accessible. The neighborhood is fairly quiet, safe and very charming.

"Sarah & Aristide were incredibly helpful from the start. We received a note upon arrival outlining what to expect at the apartment, along with guidelines on where to park - Montreal street signs can be tricky. The apartment itself was very clean, cozy, and full of character. The interior brick walls were a nice touch, the floors were slightly uneven in certain areas - we got used to it fairly quickly and it definitely added to the rustic feel of the apartment. It is also in a great location - close to various cafes, shops, and in the middle of two main streets. The kitchen was stocked with essentials for cooking - as well as coffee and tea which is always a plus. Internet was easy to connect to and very fast - there was also a small, yet loud, stereo system available for use in the living room. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it!",10.0

"I had a great stay at Sarah and Aristide's place. The apartment was super clean and really nicely decorated, with lovely creaky wooden floors that made me feel as if I was in a log cabin.

Communication was always quick. Wifi is great. Check-in and out all very smooth.

All in all I highly recommend the apartment! Thanks again Sarah and Aristide.",10.0

"Sarah & Aristide's home was a great getaway in the middle of a great area of Montreal. There is plenty to do nearby and it is roughly a 10-minute walk to Laurent. The space itself was clean, good for 2-3 people, might be a little cramped for more than that. Street parking was available but is limited due to residential permits being required for a majority of the spots, so be mindful of the spaces.

Our hosts were very quick to respond to our concerns and made us feel very welcome. We had a brief issue with the hot water but otherwise the space was really wonderful.

"We greatly enjoyed our stay in Montreal at this lovely apartment. The location was perfect and met all of our expectations. I particularly liked the garden gate which gave us access to a beautiful little alleyway so typical of the plateau. My biggest concern was parking, but thanks to the precise explanations, we easily found one right outside the apartment for the duration of our stay.

The only tricky thing is parking, but Sarah helped us out; we had a trailer with a couple scooters on it and we were able to get parking for both nights so it all worked out wonderfully. We would definitely stay here again.",10.0

During our stay, Marina was an excellent host, very attentive and extremely responsive. We had some plumbing problems one evening. Marina immediately called a plumber to come fix it the next morning and even offered us a small local gift as a way to apologize for the inconvenience.

"Located just five minutes' walk from a major bus artery, and only a 5-minute ride to the Blue Line (Metro), Paschale and Julien's home is the perfect base camp for families looking to explore Montreal and return to a quiet neighborhood at night.

While located within a 20-minute drive of all major attractions, we parked the van for three solid days and explored the city via public transit and on foot. Within a 7-minute walk of the home is a Provigo (mid-range grocery chain), two large parks with wading pools, tennis courts, basketball and baseball spaces, and even publicly available piano to play. Near one park is a fantastic breakfast place and a row of shops on Rue Beaubien including artisanal cheese and meat shops. So you needn't travel far to live like a native and entertain the children.

The home itself easily sleeps 7 (we were 5, including 3 children aged 7 to 12) and provides adequate cooking, dining, and sitting space. Clean, bright, and cozy, we felt right at home. 

Situated on the main/basement floors of a 3-story walk-up, the main floor features three bedrooms and an office we repurposed as a fourth bedroom, using the trundle bed from one of the children's bedrooms. No air conditioning, but the windows and fans proved more than adequate for the mild weather this week (no highs above 28C).

The bathrooms are nice, especially the newly remodeled basement bath with walk-in shower and attractive vanity. The basement also provides another bedroom and a sitting area with couch and futon facing a large TV; a comfortable space that could easily sleep two.

We are sorry our trip had to end. We would gladly stay here again. So glad we found this spot and hosts!",10.0

"Karim was an excellent host who provided accurate directions and instructions. The flat is located perfectly within walking distance (or a short metro ride) of all downtown action. We love to walk everywhere as Montreal is a walkable city, but we had no issues with Uber or taxis. We did not take advantage of the pool due to limited time, but it is amazing along with the rooftop patio. There were no issues with noisy neighbors and the building is relatively quiet.",9.0
Karim's apartment is awesome! It fits 5 of us comfortably. Karim offered some great local recommendations and was really helpful and responsive.

"Karim's place was sizable, but also very basic. It felt like it was only for Airbnb guests, so it was quite bare. It lacked small details like a full-length mirror and paper towels. We also ran out of toilet paper (we were two women who stayed for five days, and there were only two very small rolls when we arrived). As for the location, it was very close to the metro. The parking spot was convenient. We ended up not using our car at all (walking/taking the metro).  As a side note, if you are sensitive to cigarette smell be aware that the hallways have a strong odor. The apartment itself had none, but there were many cigarette butts on the patio. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to check out the pool. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay.",9.0

Karim was very quick to respond and helped us out with a last minute booking after our previous booking got canceled on us. Highly recommend and would definitely stay at his place again!",9.0
"Well-located, clean, good communication, interior parking *****",9.0
"This apartment enjoys central location with decent indoor parking. However, it is poorly maintained and lacks some kitchen amenities. The accumulation of dirt and dust over the year is evident on furniture and baseboards, with stains on walls and doors. The worst part is being charged a cleaning fee only to be handed a dirty apartment that was not properly cleaned after the previous night's guest.

"Great communication with Karim. 8th floor apt centrally located so you can walk everywhere. Metro just a block away.
Indoor parking was a plus as was the small pool and sauna. The apartment was nice and quiet and clean. Futon mattresses were rather hard and anyone with chemical sensitivity would notice the spray air freshener odor",9.0

Well-situated apartment, complete
Nothing to say!!!",9.0
"We were very happy with our stay. The room was exactly or better than advertised, and the amenities in the building were great (though the squash court seems to actually be a racquetball court). The location is fantastic - about a 10 minute walk from nightlife at Crescent street - and included parking is a huge plus. While we did not meet Karim in person, he was very responsive to our messages and the Argentinian steakhouse suggested in the listing was fantastic.",9.0
"Karim's place is great! Everything is as described and the location is great, close to the subway and St. Catherine Street. Karim is also super quick to respond. The only issue we had was that there wasn't enough toilet paper and we had to go buy more. There were also 4 of us but we only had 2 towels. Overall it was an amazing stay and we would definitely stay here again.",9.0
"Awesome location, I had a great weekend at Karim's place!",9.0
We stayed in Montreal for the long weekend. Our stay was amazing. Karim was quick with his responses and everything was as described.,9.0
"Karim is an excellent host and very responsive to messaging. His directions for check-in, etc., were very clear and helpful.

The place has everything you need. However, the on-site parking has a max 5'7"" clearance, so don't count on free parking if you have a truck, SUV, or minivan. 

The building is easy to find and conveniently located within the city.",9.0
"We really had a great weekend in Montreal staying at this place. The pool and sauna were extra enjoyable parts of our stay, parking was tight but manageable. The unit was nice and clean. Definitely a great place to stay downtown, just a few blocks away from restaurants, stores, and public transportation.",9.0

Perfect!,9.0
"Really good place, but be careful with the underground parking.",9.0
"The apartment is in a perfect location, just 3 minutes walk from Saint Catherine's Street, which is a really nice street and location. However, the apartment is very old, it's not clean at all, and there's a really bad smell throughout the entire building. I had to ask the owner to come back and clean the apartment again because I couldn't stay there. I sent her pictures of the floor and stains. They came back to clean, but the stains and dust were still there. I had to clean them myself. She refused to reimburse me for the cleaning fee. 
I wouldn't recommend this apartment to anyone.",9.0
Real cool,9.0
"The place is close to the main strip of bars and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay and the parking was also great. The place's cleanliness could be better, but for the price and the location and the free parking we thought it was fine.",9.0
"Karim is an excellent host and his place is clean, spacious and located in the perfect spot in downtown Montreal! 5 stars all the way!",9.0
"This apartment is located so that you can walk to the old port area or the McGill area. It's also very near the metro stop if you want it. Having indoor parking is a huge plus. Karim is very quick to answer any questions and was very kind to let us check in early. If you are looking for a nice space, but no frills and basic, this is a great place.",9.0
"Clean apartment, easy and secure access (underground parking), I recommend!",9.0
"The apartment is in the heart of downtown Montreal, making it an ideal location. The fact that a parking spot is included is a big bonus. The apartment appeared as advertised, however, it was extremely filthy. I was able to inform the host and show him, so hopefully he will address this issue and rectify it with the cleaning company he has hired. The most problematic issue was arriving in 30+ degree weather with no AC installed as advertised (which was a main criteria in selecting this place). It was quite unbearable.

While Karim was very prompt and polite in his exchanges leading up to our check-in, once this issue had to be addressed I was very unimpressed with how it was handled. After several exchanges trying to address this legitimate concern, which disrupted most of our evening, arrangements were finally made to come and install the AC that night. In the end, it only made a slight difference given that it's an older window unit. If you plan to use the kitchen, be aware that some essential items are missing; including the proper items for washing and drying dishes. Otherwise, the bed and pull-out couches are very comfortable for sleeping, and the highlight for us that mostly compensated for the other disappointments was the amazing rooftop patio and pool on the top floor. If this host is able to address the few issues mentioned, this place has a lot of potential.",9.0

Good place for the money,9.0
"Karim's place was nice and cozy. A good deal for the price considering it included parking and the location was close to everything. Only thing was that the AC wasn't very cold, however we bring a portable fan whenever we rent with Airbnb and that certainly helped. Other than that it was good. Thanks Karim!",9.0
"We've stayed at several Airbnbs. All have exceeded expectations, however this one hasn't quite lived up to them. For the most part, it was clean and tidy but had dust and grime in places that made you wonder if the rest was clean. There were only two pillows on the bed and they had pillowcases matching the bedding. Normally, I would want to sleep on pretty pillowcases or have my clients mess them up. I think a pillowcase would be a better choice. The unit is located right in the heart of lots of restaurants and shops. We had great off-street parking. And, the owner was very helpful with getting the TV to work. Turns out the batteries were dead.",9.0

"Great place to stay, stayed here in July 2018 from the USA, right in downtown, walkable to restaurants and more. Pool was not working but that wasn't Karim's fault. Parking is easy and free in a covered garage. Will definitely stay here again when I come back",9.0
"Near downtown, you can park.",9.0

Correct price
Closed pool (construction work) when we were there...

Very poor wifi...",9.0
"Had a great stay, the place was exactly what I expected",9.0
"This has an excellent location - a block from Guy Concordia metro and St Catherine's. Karin sent detailed check-in/check-out instructions so that went smoothly. The parking spot was extremely convenient to have (and rare in downtown). The room itself is nothing fancy, but the price reflects that and the pictures show exactly what to expect. I would stay at Karim’s again.",9.0
"Karim's place was very nice, and a great location too. Would definitely recommend!",9.0
"In trying to be fair, I’ll break it up into two parts:

**PROs:** Off-street parking was wonderful at this location. It's close to numerous restaurants and within walking distance of the Metro subway.

**CONs:** The floors, walls, and baseboards were extremely dirty, leaving us with a (website hidden by Airbnb) unclean feeling. The furnishings were very minimal, and the bed was very (website hidden by Airbnb) uncomfortable. We could not find washcloths or kitchen towels.

Overall, I cannot recommend this location and we would not stay again until the owner corrected the noted deficiencies.",9.0
"Karim is a wonderful host. We were able to check in a little early, which was a huge help. The Netflix was a nice addition. There was no toaster, which was a minor disappointment. The location is excellent and the gym is well-equipped.",9.0
"I would rent this again, it was such a smooth experience. The only negative thing was the parking spot, which might be the tightest corners in a parking garage. I managed alright but couldn't see myself driving a van down there. You can see scrapes where the cars hit the corners.",9.0
"Karim's place is centrally located. Just a short walk to the Bell Centre with many restaurants nearby. Free parking is a plus, but it really needs a good cleaning.",9.0
"Everything was as described and expected. The location is excellent, right next to a metro station and free parking is available. The apartment is spacious and the host is very helpful.",9.0
Amazing! Loved the pool and sauna on the roof!,9.0
"The price and location of this place are really amazing! We were in Montreal for a wedding and it was about a 10-minute walk to the venue and 5 minutes to the metro stop. I think the place needs a thorough cleaning, there's lots of dust and it's missing some essential kitchen appliances and utensils (no toaster, only one decent knife). Overall, I was happy with the stay and we used the pool and sauna which was lovely. The free parking was a great bonus but very tight for a large SUV.",9.0
Spacious apartment!,9.0
The only redeeming quality of this place is its location. It was the dirtiest and most poorly equipped Airbnb unit I have ever stayed in.,9.0
"Pro: great location, easy to find, great price, parking is a plus. Secure!
Con: The bathroom was not cleaned. There were hair and dust over the air vent and the walls. Behind the door was super dirty. The base of the toilet was filthy with urine stains. The bathtub was not cleaned, had soap gum etc.
The kitchen area was not cleaned and the oven was dirty, the refrigerator was not cleaned as well.
The bed was cheap and was horrible, the first night my back hurt so much that I slept on the futon in the living room. 
The floor was dirty and the apartment needed to be deep cleaned. To top it off the upstairs neighbors partied nonstop the time we were there. I know you’re not responsible for the hallway but the smell of curry in the hallway doesn’t help.
I read the previous reviews and I was skeptical because there's a lot of people that love to complain so I decided to see for myself. Mistake, Mistake, Mistake",9.0
Great basic place in a great location! Thanks Karim!,9.0
Not clean enough,9.0
"Karim made check-in very easy, with super informative and helpful details. The apartment is super close to the metro. Lots of great Korean food is nearby. WiFi had a good signal. Parking space was a great convenience. Unfortunately, the blue chip provided to enter the building didn't work during our entire stay, the apartment was pretty dirty and super outdated. On our last night, the hot water wasn't working. On the day of departure, it still wasn't working.",9.0

"ATTENTION!!!! ATTENTION!!!! Do not live in this place. This is the worst place you can imagine. Everything is old and dirty. Obviously the host doesn’t care about this place any more. I booked for 9 days, and tried to alter down my check out date. The host won't do it because no one would like to book this place. All the listings are old and dirty. The room is dark. The worst thing is the strong smell in the hallway and the bed. It’s definitely a horrible place to stay. And the host is not reasonable at all. I hope guests can read this and choose wisely. I had to book another place and paying for this one as well. HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE!!!!",9.0
"Karim's place had an excellent location and exactly what we were looking for. The only issue was with the on-site parking. The clearance is 70 inches, so if you have a vehicle that is higher than that, you will need to find parking elsewhere. Overall, check-in was easy and the place was very clean!",9.0

The air conditioning kept us cool on hot summer days, the balcony was lovely for coffee in the mornings, and the space was immaculate. The kitchen is amazingly well-stocked with just the things we needed to make basic meals, good coffee, and possibly a cake or two! The location ended up being perfect for our 25-minute walks to Jean Talon and 15-minute walks to Mont Royal. It is not in the center of activities in the Plateau so it was quiet and the balcony faced treetops from the second story. The closest bakery or café is a 5-10 minute walk.",10.0

Although the apartment is a little small, the three of us did not have any space problems. Allen was able to give us some recommendations for places to go in the area, and was very kind each time we interacted with him.

And though the photos might suggest there's a patio, there isn't.",10.0
Perfect location and dazzlingly rapid responses. Abe is amazing.,10.0
"This is a wonderfully located apartment. Right in the heart of the village. And at the door of the Berry metro station. No need to take any transport. However, the apartment remains calm and protected. You will find nearby restaurants, cafes, bars, clubs, shops etc... everything is within walking distance. One can live in the neighborhood without even leaving it! 
The street is magnificent because the buildings are typical of MTL. 
Abe is a quality host. 
You continue down the street and you find yourself right in the heart of the entertainment district, shopping center etc... 
Go for it!",10.0

"Great location if you want to be in the heart of The Village. Metro stop right outside the front door. (Unfortunately, there are a number of homeless people.) Still felt very safe. The building is OK, a bit older and run down, but you can't beat the location and convenience as well as the cleanliness. Not crazy about being on the first floor and there was a young child running around a lot above us that you could hear very clearly. 

The apartment was very spacious. And very reasonably priced. Great value. Had an awesome time in a great city.",10.0

"It was the ideal apartment for my friend and me during spring break. It's ideally located (although it will be even more ideal when they finish repairing the metro stop that's right next to it), clean, and plenty spacious for the both of us. We never had problems with things like hot water or the A/C. It's in a part of town where we felt safe walking home very late at night, and the check-in/check-out system is ideal for a flexible travel schedule.",10.0

"The apartment is really comfortable and cozy, and it has everything you need. My boyfriend and I felt right at home. There are two little balconies, which is nice. The neighborhood is cool with lots of restaurants, shops, and cafes, but also quite noisy at night. Also, the parking situation on the plateau can be a bit frustrating.

"This apartment is beautiful, large, and located in an incredible spot. The patio door was new and locked us out on the patio which could have been a disaster but Antoine was amazing and came within 10 minutes to help us out!

The streets around Sarah's house are perfect for wandering, exploring, eating and drinking. We loved the area. The home is green and spacious and has lovely natural light. Antoine managed our reservation and he was very responsive and helpful. He kindly allowed us to check in early as we arrived early from the airport. He went to the effort of having the apartment cleaned earlier than planned and for that we are very grateful. Thank you Sarah and Antoine. I highly recommend this apartment.",10.0

Pleasant and well-centered in the Mile End,10.0
Loved our stay in this quirky apartment. Awesome location in Mile. So responsive and helpful with information and details about the stay. Highly recommend!,10.0
"Sarah's apartment is located in a great area. There are several delicious restaurants located within a 30-second walk (Wilensky's, Fairmont Bagel, Fabrege, etc.) and several bars. The street is located a 1-minute walk from St. Laurent and public transit, making it easily accessible.

The apartment is clean, tidy, eclectic.

The apartment is very small. The bedroom is tiny but the terrace is a nice touch, there is a terrace off the kitchen as well, which offers a private spot to enjoy morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. 

The downside is the tiny bathroom, which is functional but very small.
During a heat wave, we recommend that a window AC unit be available. It was so hot and muggy in the apartment which made our stay less enjoyable.

Thank you to Sarah and Antoine's employee/helper for quickly setting up the mattress for the 3rd guest. Thank you for the bottle of wine as well, that was a very thoughtful gesture.

The location is great, the apartment is clean, tidy and artfully eclectic, which is something we appreciated.

Thank you!",10.0

"Ali's apartment is very functional, clean and well-located in Montreal. The rooftop terrace is very much appreciated at any time of the day. Communication has been very easy and responsive. We highly recommend Ali.",9.0
"Our stay at Ali's place was exceptional. It was my first time using Airbnb, but Ali and the check-in host were both very accommodating and great at answering questions. The apartment is within walking distance of nearly everything in Montreal, but there are plenty of things to do near his home as well. We got a parking ticket at 8:30 AM when the street meter said we could park the car between 9PM-9AM, so if you're unsure about parking it might be safest to leave the car in a garage.",9.0
"Ali was an excellent host, the apartment was very clean and comfortable. The location was great and we found that most sights were within walking distance. We were able to find paid parking on the street out front with no issues. Definitely recommend!",9.0

I really recommend this place. Thanks, Ali",9.0
"We stayed at Ali's place for two nights to explore the city. The location is great, and communication with the host and management company was excellent. We arrived later than expected but that was thankfully no problem. The key exchange felt somewhat rushed though, and we never got an answer as to where to best park our car in the neighborhood during the day. Free parking is available o/n just on the street (9pm-9am). The apartment itself is well equipped and designed, it was clean and had everything we needed. It doesn't feel as much like home as we would have liked, but the building has a great rooftop with lots of sun. I recommend this place.",9.0

"This apartment is well located, next to a couple of convenience stores and a short walking distance from the shopping area and metro. Nice bonus: rooftop deck with view on the city skyline. Parking on the street, which may or may not be easy to find depending on the day and time of day.

Four people can sleep, with one double bed in the bedroom and a very comfortable IKEA sectional that converts into a queen-size bed in the living room. There was no coffee maker which should be taken into consideration when planning your trip -- We needed to go out to get our coffee in the morning. Communication through Airbnb was very pleasant, and we felt well served as we prepared for our arrival and at check-in.",9.0
Excellent! Everything is very very good!,9.0
"Well-located housing, that is the only positive point. 
There is a very bad smell in the bathroom with very noisy ventilation.
Very little toilet paper and overall equipment at minimum.
The worst thing is that there is no window on the sliding track, it's placed next to its location and therefore cold air enters the room which should be overheated.
We had to patch the hole with bath towels and cushions from the sofa.
After contacting the rental agency and reporting the problem, which was almost blamed on us, I received this email response from my interlocutor.

Thank you for this message. 
After checking with the owner, it's like that all the time... I can understand that it brings in the cold but I don't have a better solution to offer. 

I can only advise you to try blocking with towels (there are others in the closet), and increase the heating if the cold passes too much.
I am sorry that I can only give you this ""solution"".

At your disposal if needed.
Have a good day,
Sacha",9.0

"It is a terrible place, it was extremely dirty, there was no internet connection, the place was hot and humid and there was no fan.

"Ali is an amazing host and very helpful! I had such an amazing stay and the location is PERFECT!!! It's in the center of everything. Everything is within walking distance, and the neighborhood is lively. I definitely recommend it!",9.0
"Ali was an excellent host and very communicative. Most importantly, he was very patient when our estimated arrival time was later than expected (we were driving from New York to Montreal). The space is accurately described, but during extremely hot summer days and nights, it gets very little ventilation (windows are small and face a courtyard). While it says there's no AC, fans should be provided. We requested two fans and were only told we could be reimbursed for one fan. We had two people staying in the back room and one person in the living room - being limited to one fan was not sufficient to provide circulation. Also, the showerhead was broken and not fixed during our stay. We did not use the shower on the first day or two to avoid spraying water all over the bathroom (it got the toilet paper wet) - not taking a shower on top of a hot apartment was not ideal. Finally, the washer had very dirty/gross sheets in it - if we are paying for a cleaning fee, we shouldn't have to see that.",9.0
"Excellent address, very well located. We had a wonderful stay and fully enjoyed the rooftop and the view of Montreal. Excellent communication with Ali. Highly recommend.",9.0
"Great location, fair price.",9.0
"I stayed in Ali's apartment for 5 days. Ali was very available and responsive. Check-in and check-out were simple.

The apartment matched the photos. 

However, the mattress on the bed is not very comfortable (that's putting it mildly). There's also a problem with the bed slats that sag, but Ali promised he would fix this point after my departure.

The bedroom isn't separated from the rest of the apartment by a door. As a result, if you are sensitive to noise, you will hear the refrigerator turning on regularly.

Speaking of noise, the entrance door is very poorly insulated; however, all apartments in the building were designed this way...

The apartment and the building itself aren't brand new, but a bit like everywhere else in Montreal. During my stay, painters were working on the common areas.

Highlights of the apartment:

- Location (bus stops, subway station, shops, Mont Royal Park)
- Rooftop with beautiful views, especially at night
- Clean and functional bathroom
- Washer and dryer
- TV with Netflix

In summary, I was quite satisfied with my stay despite the points mentioned above.",9.0

"Very clean recently refurbished apartment on the ground floor of a 3-story block. Everything is as listed, and it was obvious this was a new house as some of the utensils were still in their wrappers. Combination code on the front door for access.

Location great for Little Italy (best bagels and ice cream shops nearby). Parking on the street for residents only or at parking meters during the day (9-9), but the street was very quiet with lots of spaces. 

The apartment has 3 double beds and a small bathroom with a good, powerful shower in the bath. Washer and dryer. Anthony also put an inflatable double air mattress that can fit in the living room. 

There is one AC unit in the kitchen/living room area. 

Yes, it has wifi. We had plenty of room for three teenagers and two parents.",9.0

Check-in was very smooth, with the excitement of getting the kids packed and on and off the plane I'd forgotten to contact Anthony about check-in. But, upon landing I saw he'd already messaged me all the information my family would need to get into our rental. The location was easy to get to, and we were able to settle right in. At the time we stayed, small touches like dish detergent, hand soap, laundry detergent, paper towels, and strong wifi went a long way and were appreciated. There are tons of places to eat in the area, and we utilized nearby public transit daily. This place worked well for my family and made our trip possible with lots of happy memories.",9.0

It was also an incredibly convenient location, with easy access to a variety of different things to do (restaurants, museums, Old Montreal, bars, and nightclubs). I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone who asked, and would gladly stay again myself. Five stars!",9.0

"Anthony was a wonderful host! He allowed us to check in a couple hours early and walked us through the parking situation. He was very pleasant and responsive. The place itself was very cool and well kept. We did have some hot water issues, but since we only stayed for one night, Anthony didn't have the chance to fix them in the time we were there, and he did assure us he would do so before his next guest arrived. Overall, fantastic place to stay!",9.0
"We were not lucky, no hot water, no dishwasher and dirty sheets",9.0
"Anthony is a great communicator and we were able to check in easily and get anything addressed quickly. The house is in a great location, an older house but remodeled retaining elements of both. It was clean for the most part. We were a group of 7 and fit comfortably, but keep in mind one of the walls between two bedrooms are French doors so there is a bit less privacy due to that, so you’ll have to be comfortable with that. Very convenient to St. Viateur bagels :) so a great place to see Montreal and really convenient place to park a car if you bring one.",9.0
"Hello

Very nice accommodation with 3 large comfortable bedrooms just a stone's throw from Boulevard Saint Laurent. The owner is very responsive to your requests, don't hesitate ;) all the comfort on site, a perfect stay for us!",9.0

"Mile End is a phenomenal neighborhood. Jeans Jeans Jeans is one block away, and it's an amazing experience to buy jeans there. The overall vibe of Mile End is great, and the accommodations fit perfectly for our trip and our family (including picky/cool teens).",9.0
The place was in the most convenient spot I've stayed in Montreal. The unit was huge! Great space for the 6 of us who stayed over!,9.0
The place has some potential.,9.0
"The space was a little smaller than expected, especially a space that advertises it can accommodate eight.  

Since the bedrooms were so close to the common area/kitchen and/or bathroom, we all had to agree upon a time to sleep and wake so as not to disturb one another. If eight guests slept here, they would probably be sleeping in the living room which is very close to the kitchen and bathroom and will surely wake anyone sleeping in it.

There was a TV but it didn't have any channels, so it seemed a little redundant to have. 

Overall, the space accommodated our needs, which were to sleep, shower, and eat, but if we had wanted to spend any time in the space, much more than we did, I would be on top of one another.  

On a positive note, the bed I slept in was very comfortable and didn't move when shifted in my sleep, so my partner wasn't disturbed. 

Cafes were very close by with great coffee. 

Parking over the weekend was not an issue. Review parking for weekday stays. 

Check-in was seamless.",9.0

"Great location, but a bit rundown.",9.0
"Wow! What a fantastic stay... first of all, this rental is in an ideal neighborhood - you have Mile End at your fingertips and the rest of the Plateau is not far away. I loved just exploring the side streets. This place was a great value and definitely worth staying a bit further from downtown. I would definitely stay here again.",9.0
"Our stay at Anthony’s place was comfortable and convenient for our family vacation (4 adults, 1 teen). Beds were clean and comfortable. The walls are a bit thin.

We ate breakfast in the unit quite a bit and found that all the necessary supplies were present for cooking. The dishwasher was not in service.

The unit is a good value and has all necessary items for a nice stay. Anthony was good about getting back to us. Recommend overall.",9.0

"Staying at Anthony's place was absolutely perfect - clean, cozy, and had everything you need. The location is ideal if you don't desire to be in the center of everything, but still close enough (walking distance to tons of amazing restaurants and shops). Additionally, Anthony was very accommodating to allow me to check in a little earlier. When I return to Montreal, I know where I am staying and where I would recommend others stay!",9.0
"Hello, we stayed for three nights, there were four adults and three children. The accommodation was too small. A lot of appliances did not work, dishwasher, washing machine and dryer. There was very little tableware to prepare meals. I do not recommend it for families. The host did not greet us and left no information about Montreal or the accommodation.",9.0
Anthony is a very welcoming host and his place is in a great location in Mile End. Thanks!,9.0

We would definitely recommend this place!",9.0
"Antony was very attentive to any issues we had and tried to remedy them as best he could. He was very prompt in answering our messages and queries, The living areas and kitchen were very clean and spacious, we liked the large table and the sofa was very comfortable.  The beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean. We were disappointed by the condition of the outdoor terrace and the bathroom. The apartment, being on the ground floor, was quite dark and the window looked out on a blank wall. There is no terrestrial (Canadian) TV.",9.0

There were two balconies, two bathrooms, big comfortable beds, and extra linens if needed. They were very accommodating with everything, including check-in and checkout, which made everything so much easier!

"This place is amazing, would absolutely recommend it! First, the apartment is beautiful and spacious. It has everything you could need and more; it's much larger than the pictures show. We had 7 people sleep comfortably here for a weekend. Also, the location is amazing!!!! You cannot find a better location than this apartment, right near shops, bars, restaurants, and more.

You will not regret staying here!,10.0

Just be aware that the apartment is right above a karaoke bar and on a street with a lot of nightlife, so it's pretty loud on weekend evenings. You also need to bring luggage up and down a few flights of fire escape stairs. If you don’t mind that, it's a great place to stay and good value in the area!",10.0

"This place has an unbeatable location. Six of us went up for a night to go to the Canadiens/Bruins game, and everything was within walking distance from the rink to the bars to the entertainment. Communication was great and check-in/check-out was very easy. There is no parking on site, but there is a parking garage about 1 block down the street for around $30 Canadian per day. My only problem with the place is that the 13 guest claim is a stretch. This wasn't a problem for us as we only had 6, but future travelers should be aware of this. There are 3 bedrooms, each with a queen bed, a futon, and a couch. By my count (if you put 2 in each bed and the futon and 1 on the couch) that is enough room for 9. There were some floor mattresses stuffed into the closets, so I guess you could find a spot on the floor for those to get to 13 but that wouldn't be very comfortable. Also, there were only sheets/pillows provided for the 3 bedrooms so make sure to bring your own sleeping bags/pillows. Two of my friends had to use their luggage as pillows and their coats as blankets. This being said, I would definitely rent here again. Location, location, location.",10.0
It was an amazing get-together. Highly recommend this huge Airbnb!,10.0

I would recommend this beautiful apartment to anyone who is easy-going and looking to be in the heart of the city!

"This place exceeded all my expectations in every possible way. It was by far the most attractive place available when we were looking, and the location was so perfect. Everything we wanted to do or needed to go was right at our doorstep. 

We stayed here for my 30th birthday, and it was an absolute blast. There was more than enough space for everyone in our group of six. All the beds were comfortable, and there was lots of space to hang out in the home, too. 

Hernan was very welcoming and made us feel at home right away. He was very responsive to every request and question we had, and so accommodating. We were able to have early check-in and check out which made our whole trip more enjoyable. 

We fell in love with Montreal on this trip. If we come back with a large group, I would definitely check to see if this place would be available to us again.  I would strongly recommend this place!!",10.0

"We had two months in Montreal while visiting McGill and this location was perfect. A short walk to McGill but also to the Plateau and even downtown. The apartment was very comfortable and well-provided for and was pleasantly quiet. Access to shopping, cafes, and restaurants within the building was fabulous - particularly in the snow! - and the gym membership was the icing on the cake: pool, sauna, spas, weights, etc., all just an elevator trip away. Finally, Vanessa was immediately responsive to questions and queries. All up, I would recommend this wholeheartedly! Thanks, Vanessa, for a very memorable stay.",9.0

Stewie was a great host, very easy to communicate with, check-in/checkout was a breeze, and very fast to answer any questions we had.

It is outside of downtown Montreal so it is nice and quiet when you want to relax, but only a short drive to go sightseeing. I would absolutely stay at this place again.",9.0
"To be honest, I wasn't really happy about this stay at all. We were jerked around from the start about available properties and then told we weren't allowed to stay there, told we had to move properties three weeks before our stay, and were told that the second location was downtown when it very, very clearly was not. We were charged for part of a second day stay despite no information on the listing about a minimum stay and also charged extra because of the 'holiday weekend' when Memorial Day is not celebrated in Canada. I would not recommend the property I stayed in or liaising with Stewie to anyone I know. Perhaps if we had been able to stay in our initial, actually downtown property, we would have had a better experience, but frankly I wish we had stayed in a downtown hotel instead.",9.0

This apartment was super upscale and beautifully decorated, very spacious. I thought it was truly incredible value for the price, and completely exceeded my expectations. Only downside was that it was hot in summer, but the airflow was good and fans were provided so we were comfortable. We came for a family wedding and saw other people's Airbnbs - this one was the best and we paid less than others.",10.0
"This apartment is so lovely — well-designed and decorated. You can tell the hosts put a lot of care into making it sophisticated and cozy. I love the natural light. The open and well-equipped kitchen is perfect for making a meal. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, and there's a great yoga studio around the corner. A little hot without an AC unit, but the fans are fine. I would stay here again. It's a great place.",10.0

"The apartment is comfortable, very pleasant and beautiful. A big thank you to Laurence for her kindness.",10.0
"Laurence's place is super cute in photos, but even better in person! It's super spacious, with two porches, a *huge* bedroom, tons of natural light, Netflix (!), and total private access. The washer/dryer in unit came in handy too when I needed to clean up a shirt for a night out. My boyfriend and I completely fell in love with the apartment, and because it's a bit out of the downtown area, gave us a chance to see another part of Montreal -- a city we've come to love together as New Yorkers. It really only took about 10 minutes via Uber to get anywhere we needed or wanted to go, so don't let the location deter you!",10.0
We had a fantastic stay at Laurence's place. The apartment was super comfortable and it had everything we needed to cook. Very close to the metro and the grocery store. Highly recommend!,10.0

"My daughter and I had just 36 hours in Montreal and were very pleased to be so centrally located in this fun, well-decorated apartment.  We loved the proximity to so many great nearby restaurants.  Also we were very close to Fitz and Follwell, the bike shop where we took a fantastic bike tour of several nearby parks and neighborhoods. 
We also utilized the subway system to go downtown. The metro station is just a few blocks away and very easy, affordable and efficient to use.  
We loved eating the delicious (St Viateur) famous bagels, the (Romas) Portuguese chicken, the (Swartz's) smoked meats, the (Pizzadelic) pizza and crepes. All within walking distance.

"Lovely place, and great location! Would definitely recommend it. Such a neat neighborhood to stay in. Thanks again!",10.0
"Martin's apartment was great! Amazing location in the heart of Le Plateau, within walking distance of trendy bars, restaurants, shops, cafes, and supermarkets. We even walked to Old Montreal which took us about 35 minutes. The apartment itself was bigger than it looked in the pictures, very well decorated and clean. We got lucky and were able to snag one of the free parking spaces on the street, which was a bonus. Overall, one of my favorite Airbnb experiences in Montreal. Highly recommend!",10.0
"This place was awesome! Right next to Avenue du Mont-Royal which has a bunch of places to eat, buses, and trains to get just about anywhere. A bike shop is two blocks away and we biked to Vieux Montréal. The apartment was clean, looks exactly as depicted, definitely a cool, hip space. Great location too for getting everything you need.

Getting to the mountain is only 10-15 minutes as well. The bike share system in Montreal worked great to head down to the river. The apartment itself was spacious and worked wonderfully. The bed was ridiculously comfy. There is a full kitchen and a nice living room area to hang out. Martin was quick to respond to our messages as well. Overall, it was a great experience.",10.0

"The apartment is in a great location, a quiet neighborhood, and within walking distance of many stores and the metro. The main bedroom is very comfortable. The second bedroom has a single bed with a trundle bed underneath, which is best suited for kids. Keyless entry is a nice touch; no more losing keys! There's no parking on-site (you can easily drop off your luggage without any problems) and guests may want to take advantage of the permitted spaces Martin has available. We parked in a garage and paid twice as much, but it was very convenient. All in all, a great place to stay in Montreal!",10.0

My family and I loved staying at this flat in the heart of a thriving neighborhood. There were so many things to do that we wished we had stayed longer. We ended up booking two stacked units from Martin which was perfect for our situation. The decor was fun and inviting and felt like home to us. We loved the antique touches and plants scattered throughout. Checking in and communication was super fast and the apartment had all the necessities for a cozy stay. Thanks!,10.0

Definitely recommend staying here!",10.0
"We chose the Quartier du Mont Royal for its proximity to the park and the apartment of one of our friends. We therefore knew what to expect.

"This was a great apartment for our long weekend in Montreal. The hosts were very communicative and answered all of our questions. They were also very kind in letting us arrange to store our bags before and after check-in and check-out. 

The apartment is as stylish as it appears, and very convenient to the Plateau neighborhood. We walked all around the neighborhoods from Old Montreal to Little Italy, and when it was too far to walk, subways and buses were right there. 

The only slight negative would be that, since it is a street-level apartment with the bedrooms facing the street, noise at night may get a little loud if people are hanging out on the street.",10.0

"Martin's place is very comfortable and well-furnished. It's in a great area of Montreal, close to many restaurants, cafes, and similar establishments. It's also within walking distance to the Metro station, so getting to other areas of the city is quick. The only downside to the apartment is that it can be noisy at times. 

The building is old and has wooden floors, and the apartment directly above seems to be another rental. We were woken up on the first morning by a group of people stomping around at 6 AM and then dragging their bags down the iron staircase directly outside the bedroom window, and then last night woken up well after midnight by another group arriving.

Overall, the apartment was great, but could be annoying depending on the other tenants.",10.0

"Cédric and Christina's place had a lot of space for three of us, as well as a balcony where we could spend some time in the evening. Unfortunately, and for the first time ever, we had a really bad experience staying at the apartment. We were unable to use the front door key from the outside and found it thus impossible to leave the place. Communication with the hosts was nearly impossible for the whole time, 20 hours later they also rejected to come by because no-one had been available. Fortunately Airbnb helped us out with the case and we were able to leave, find another place to stay and still enjoy the couple of days in Montreal. My friends and I would not recommend staying at Cédric's place.",8.0
I suppose 'old' and 'in process of repair' is the charm of Montreal in general. This apartment certainly fits that description.,8.0
"We had a terrible experience here.  This was our first ever Airbnb stay after seven previous stays and the place was so dirty that we were able to get a refund through Airbnb support. 
Some of the furniture was so old it wasn't usable anymore. This is a rundown dorm room, not a nice place to stay. 
The host had a strict refund policy (of course), but she did refund us. She charged us cleaning fees though, which was very ironic!",8.0

"The house is a spacious and beautiful basement typical of a Montreal neighborhood undergoing revitalization, from which it is easy to reach the city center. The furnishings are modern and functional, with some refinement like an hydromassage tub. However, the kitchen lacks sufficient equipment for more than two people, missing a coffee machine, so it's for those who don't intend to cook at home. The TV can only be used as a screen for computers; there are no visible channels, and there is no radio. Communication and services may become difficult because the host does not live nearby (as happened to us).",10.0

"Steve's Apartment #8 on the second floor was perfect for my baby daughter, husband, and me for our 5-night stay in Montreal. Just in front of the door, the 55 bus stops, which is perfect for getting around. Also, the area itself, Plateau Mont Royal, is very trendy and hip. You can reach grocery stores, liquor stores, bars, Schwartz's, restaurants, and cafes within walking distance of less than 5 minutes. Steve is very helpful and goes above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. The apartment itself is quite basic but well-equipped. We would highly recommend staying here and would definitely come back again.",9.0
Comfortable apartment with the ideal location for having fun in Montreal. Everything you will need is within a 15-minute walk. Steve is responsive to any questions and knows Montreal well.,9.0
"Location, Location, Location! You are in the hip part of the Plateau Mont Royal. Everything you need is less than a block away: great restaurants, a fantastic grocery store with lots of international food and vegan options, an ice cream place, and a great crepe spot. Don't miss the Jerk store, just next door to the apartment. Steve's place has really fast internet, but the coffee shop downstairs has the best coffee, so it quickly became my office :). Oh, important detail, Steve has a really nice A/C unit in the bedroom. The place was really clean. Steve helped me get a parking spot on the next block, so I didn't have to deal with parking my car on the street. And he showed me the cool spot in the neighborhood!",9.0
We had a great stay at Steve's place. The location was perfect and quiet. The AC was much appreciated during warm days and nights. The apartment was spacious and clean. Communication with Steve was easy and fast. I would definitely stay there again.,9.0
"We liked the location. Steve was super responsive and overall a great host. There was an electricity breakdown at 11pm on the night of our check-in, and he sent someone to fix it. He also provided a parking space next door for an additional fee. The bathroom was supplied with toiletries: soap, shampoo, body gels, toilet paper. 

If you are *allergic* to pet fur, this might be important to you: we found some on furniture legs in the 2nd bedroom. We spent most of the time outside exploring Montreal and it only caused a reaction when we were playing on the floor with a kid, but still it isn’t something I would expect from an apartment where pets aren’t allowed. 

I hope the points above are easy to fix and recommend Steve as a great host to anyone who wants to spend some quality time in Montreal.",9.0

"Solid place to stay with easy access to all the action, but not so close that you deal with all the riffraff. Steve is an excellent communicator, he's very responsive and helpful. Had a minor issue with the air conditioning not working, but he had someone come fix it within 10 minutes (it was a settings issue, not a mechanical malfunction). Thanks again, Steve!",9.0
"3rd floor apartment, great location. Good restaurants, coffee shops & bakeries nearby. Hardwood floors, no carpet...a plus in my book. Owner very responsive. Parking is available but somewhat expensive at $20 CAD/night. We were there during a very hot spell and electricity went out in the apartment at 1 AM. No electricity meant no AC. I messaged Steve and he responded immediately with a call to me. He determined what needed to be done. Electricity was restored by noon the next day.",9.0
"This place is right in the heart of a charming neighborhood with real character—lots of small restaurants and bars, and sandwiched between two amazing parks. Coffee on the deck in the morning was relaxing. The apartment makes you feel like you're a regular local.",9.0
"Steve is an excellent host, responsive and accommodating! The apartment is very well located between Plateau and Mount Royal, I recommend",9.0
"Ish was such a great host! He was very good at communicating with me before I arrived, explaining exactly where to go and how to reach the apartment. The location is very close to the metro and bus stations as well as many of the main areas to visit while in Montreal. It was very easy to navigate on foot from the apartment to Old Port, Place Jacques Cartier, Saint Catherine St, and the metro station. I would definitely stay here again!",9.0

"Great location for everything downtown. Chinatown, St. Catharines, Notre-Dame church etc. Everything is within walking distance. Very clean, WiFi and Netflix available. Very safe neighborhood - right next to a police station. Definitely would stay here again. 

If you are driving, there's not much parking downtown so be aware of that.",9.0
"The apartment was very welcoming and cozy. It was very close to restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.  It was only about a 15-minute walk to Old Montreal, and a shopping mall nearby. Awesome stay, clean place, five stars",9.0
"Very good stay! Apartment close to restaurants and everything you need for a good stay in Montreal. It is very easy to communicate with the host if you have any questions. The negative points are the lack of free parking nearby, and curtains that aren't opaque enough for morning sunlight (in my opinion). (But this is just my opinion). I would definitely go back there!",9.0

"In a prime and super convenient location! We didn't have enough toilet paper for the 3 nights we stayed there, and the kitchen doesn't have any baking sheets or anything to put in the oven if you plan on using it. Other than that, prime location! Cozy and warm.",9.0
"Ish's place is great! Located very close to the convention center and Chinatown, I was able to walk home for quick breaks. The bed was also very comfortable, so it was easy to fall asleep at night. This place was everything I needed.",9.0
"Ish's place was pretty awesome! The listing is very accurate - a cute bachelor suite with a spacious bathroom, and lots of natural light. Ish was also very accommodating, and we definitely appreciated that! The best thing about the apartment was the location - minutes to EVERYTHING! It's nestled between four very different neighborhoods of downtown, gay village, old Montreal, and St-Denis/St-Laurent strips. We couldn't have asked for a better spot. IGA is a couple of blocks away too, as well as a number of major bus routes, so it was super easy to get around!! I would totally book this place again, SO worth it. (internet was super slow, but no biggie since we spent most of our time out and about).",9.0
"The place was great, exactly as described. The place was very stylish and in an excellent location.",9.0
The place was perfect for me; it was a short walk to the restaurants and shopping centers. Excellent location.,9.0
"Great location. Close to metro stations, bus stops, and restaurants. The place was very clean and cozy. I would definitely recommend staying here while visiting Montreal!",9.0
"This apartment is very comfortable, clean, and very well located. The description is really accurate; you are minutes on foot to anywhere downtown. Ish is very communicative and responds nearly instantly. This was especially useful in my case as I had trouble with the access card. Make extra caution not to place the card near a magnetic field (magnet, phone...) or you will not be able to get in ;-) Ish however was very helpful and solved this for me very quickly. Also, a new door access system will be put in place in the upcoming weeks in the building so this issue will probably disappear with it. To summarize, I stayed there for 3 weeks for work and I would highly recommend it! Great place for the price range!",9.0
Excellent reception and excellent communication. The apartment is clean and well-designed and close to the Place des Arts.,9.0
"Cannot say enough good things about this host and flat in Old Montreal. They got back to us immediately if we had any concerns and the place was exactly as described, if not better. The location is great, right in the heart of all the action and walking distance to whatever you need. I would highly recommend staying here",9.0

"This place is perfect for anyone wanting to chill and explore Montreal; it's in the perfect location, safe, clean, and within walking distance of so much to do and see. You won't need taxis or buses. The place itself was super clean and had a cozy home vibe. I will definitely be coming back next year and would recommend anyone to stay here!",9.0
"The place was clean and in a great location. It was within walking distance of everything you needed, and Ish provided details beforehand on where everything was, which was helpful. One downside, which the host could not control, was the door to get into the building was broken. You would have to wait for someone to show up to get in. Also, the bed wasn't the most comfortable, but otherwise it was a great stay and I would stay again.",9.0
"Great location with easy check-in, clean and a great host! Will definitely stay here again.",9.0
"This past weekend, August 24-26, was my first time staying at an Airbnb. Based on the information provided and the reviews, it was a good stay, but could be improved (3.7 out of 5 stars). The place was clean. The location was good; about 10-20 minutes walk from most things. Check-in was easy, although in my opinion, it could be improved in ways that I won't address. There are toiletries and the daily basic home stuff you could use. There is NO onsite parking, but there are some lots for about $15/night that took me some time to find; an exact address of a parking lot would have been very helpful after a long 7-hour drive. The biggest concern for my boyfriend and I was the bed. The bed was too soft and sunk in (in the middle of the bed) for our liking. It made our sleep very uncomfortable to the point we kept trying to move to the side to get the flat surface, but would eventually end up back in the middle sunk in. I understand that it could have been due to the use over time. I think that it could easily be fixed by investing in a new mattress. Another thing that I noticed was all the bedding stuff and towels smelled like Febreze that was in the bathroom. I'm not sure if the detergent used to wash has the same smell, but that was what I noticed. Overall, it was a good first stay. Thank you, Ish!",9.0
"Ish was an amazing host. Everything was spotless. He left towels, a few dishes, bathroom essentials, TV (with Netflix available) all for the guest to use. It was close to shopping centers (supermarket, cinema, SAQ, metro...etc). The pictures do not lie, exactly what is photographed is what you will enjoy. If all these suit your desires for a trip in Montreal, Ish’s apartment is the one for you.",9.0

Ish was very helpful in ensuring my stay was very comfortable. The unit is spacious and located in a great spot.,9.0
"Great location, near public transportation/restaurants, and what even appears to be a police station next door, felt very safe.  A good place for a few days. However, as some people have said, the bed is uncomfortable and sinks quite a lot in the middle. It would be good for a single person, but as a couple, it felt like we were falling towards each other and made it difficult to sleep with our backs twisted. I understand beds sink over time, but it should probably be replaced. The shower curtain is a very thin material and it looks like it can tear easily so be careful when pulling it back. The floors are wood and tile, so if you visit in the winter be careful with your shoes and be mindful of the winter salt/melting snow. Also, for those not used to city living, there are two doors when entering the building, the first door must close before the second door can unlock. If the first door is held open or hasn't shut, the second won't open at all.",9.0

Location! Location! Location! It's super convenient to take public transportation to basically anywhere in Montreal. It's in a quiet neighborhood. A supermarket is 10 steps from the apartment. There's street parking available. Just ask some locals if you have trouble reading the signs. We requested late check-in and Ian was able to accommodate our request. The place is a basement apartment with all the basic necessities plus some extras. Nice and clean.,9.0

Great place to stay,9.0
"The accommodation matched the description perfectly and the caretaker was very nice, but there are two things to be aware of: it was very humid when we were there, while it wasn't outside, and you absolutely should NOT use the washing machine and dryer that the owner kindly provides for his clients if you don't want to find your belongings full of holes. In my case, two new t-shirts ended up in the trash, which is really frustrating",9.0
Ian was very communicative and the place matched the photos exactly. It's perfect if you need a place to crash sleep in Montreal. It's close to a metro station *and* a grocery store. The neighborhood was quiet (we stayed early September).,9.0

"This basement apartment is perfect for a couple. Great location, walking distance to shops, restaurants and the metro. Very modern and clean. Check-in was very easy and the girls were helpful. 

The TV only has one cable channel, so you probably want to bring Apple TV or something and there are only 2 very thin pillows.

Parking is on the street!

Overall a great place to stay and will use it again :O) Thank you!",9.0
"The bed isn't very comfortable. The shower needs fixing. But otherwise, I loved it. Ian was so nice, the metro is right around the corner (late-night snacks). It's worth the price!",9.0

"This was a nice place. It looked newly renovated and was very spacious and comfortable. There were amenities nearby. We drove and found that there were parking spaces on the street nearby. We didn't make much use of the subway, but one was close by. Overall, the cost was well worth it.",9.0

Definitely coming back here in the future!",9.0
"The apartment is very well located. 
Comfortable. Modern.
Its strong point is the proximity of two shops and the metro station. 
Tip: Avoid taking the car as even if there is parking on the adjacent street, it's not free. 
Improvement point: The humidity level could be improved. We left the bathroom ventilation open all along. 
Apartment we recommend",9.0
"Clean apartment with a large bathtub and well-equipped. Very close to shops and the metro.

However, access via a rear courtyard is not very welcoming, note that the apartment is on the ground floor: there's little light, which wasn't a problem for us as we were mainly using it for sleeping, for TV you need the system with the smartphone. 

We really liked this apartment which met our needs, excellent value for money.",9.0
"Ran out of hot water during shower

Parking was a bit difficult 

Late check-in not available",9.0
"Very uncomfortable/regrettable stay. This is actually half of a basement on the ground level. While the interior of the spaces matches the photos, what was not shown is the path you have to walk through to get to your basement apartment entrance. After spending 10-15 minutes searching for parking every night, you walk into a dark alley (about 10 meters), with smelly garbage dumped on both sides of the alley. At the end of the alley, turn left and you walk into two cars semi-blocking the entrance to the basement units. There are woods and other dumps and garbage in the vicinity. There are spider webs that you will walk right into your face. You will have to squeeze through two vehicles without dirtying your clothes before you get to Ft dr #1. Unlock dr #1, you walk into an unfinished hallway with woods piling in front of dr #2, which open into the basement apartment. Imagine if you are dressed in nice clothes walking through the above 3-4 times a day from the apartment to your car. The place is very uncomfortable due to the following facts: 1. There is no bedboard, so you cannot sit up and read in bed. 2. The humidity in the unit is extremely high. There is a dehumidifier put away in a small closet room, but we were not informed until we found it on the second night. When I say extremely high, I mean you cannot even sit in the room without sweating. We used the dehumidifier (did not help much), and every 10 hours or so, we need to empty a tank of water from the dehumidifier tank before it overflows. 3. The outdoor temperature at night after 9 pm during our stays (Aug 29-Sept 4) is < 20°C. But the inside temperature is at 28°C. With the humidity and heat, we did not sleep for more than 4 hours per night. 4. On the fourth night, we found a fan (dusty and semi-working) in the closet room. It did little help after we had to wash off the dust on the fan. 5. We informed Ian that we are very uncomfortable and his reply was to buy a fan valued up to $40 and he would refund us. My message to Ian: Hi Ian, we are three nights into our stay and each night has been very uncomfortable. Even last night at 3 am it was 28.5°C. Too warm, humid and hard to breathe. As we're not even able to open a window. Outside was under 20°C Is there anything you can do to make the stay more tolerable? In addition to the comfort issues, I also wanted to note a few things that are broken: The dryer handle, The coffee machine ---------- Ian reply: Hello, maybe you can buy a fan up to $40 that I would refund you? I have photos and videos to support my claim. Message me on F/b if anyone wants to see.",9.0
"Ian's place is great. It has everything you could need, including a washing machine and tumble dryer. It's located very conveniently to the nearby station Snowdon that takes you straight to downtown or Old Montreal. There's also a McDonalds nearby if you fancy breakfast! A nice touch was that the TV has a Chromecast for those nights when you feel like watching silly videos on YouTube. This Airbnb definitely made my trip worth it.",9.0

Noteworthy is a king-size bed - incredibly comfortable - where you could easily spend your day! The host is a delightful Dutch lady who has been living in Canada since 1956, very friendly. She lives with a shy, fluffy cat and another person whose room is on the same floor as ours but was away for the holidays.

Overall, complete satisfaction!",10.0

There was a small fridge, tea and a kettle as well as a welcome bowl of fresh fruit.

"Jose's place is amazing and Jose is a lovely host with so much knowledge to share. The shower is one of the nicest showers I've ever used and the bed is extremely comfortable. The neighborhood has a great village feel with a sailing club, swimming pool and large park along with restaurants and shops. All in all, a great experience.",10.0

"What a surprise to find this place! Pointe Claire is a charming little town with so much character & friendliness, and only minutes from downtown Montreal. Jose is so warm and welcoming, and her home is clean and comfortable. I really liked the big bedroom and big shower. I hope to stay here again on my return visit.",10.0
"Jose's house is in a nice little town with history dating back to American Indians, a block from bars and restaurants, two blocks from the river. We actually had pretty much all of the upstairs for ourselves - very private. The room and a private bathroom are freshly renovated and everything is sparkling clean. Jose is a great host with stories to tell. We will definitely stay there every time we are in the area.

Jose, thank you for your hospitality.",10.0
"This is a wonderful place right by the water. Jose was a truly professional host. The suite upstairs is like a luxury hotel room. She knew I was there to get some work done so she left me to myself yet still was very friendly when we crossed paths. Tip for those doing a similar work holiday: half a block one way is the serene water, half a block another way (on St. Anne's) is a great yoga studio with drop-in classes, and half a block another way is a pool with lane swimming for $5. Great stay and fantastic host!",10.0
"Thanks for everything, Jose.",10.0
"Jose's place is very nice. Clean, cozy, and comfortable. The room was big enough, with a big bed, clean and big bathroom. You feel like you are at home and Jose's hospitality is excellent. If you are in Montreal and you want a great, quiet place to stay, you must book at Jose's.",10.0

"Jose is a fantastic host, thoughtful and respectful. His house is charming and eclectic, and the proximity of Pointe-Claire village and the lake truly made my stay feel like a holiday. Highly recommend.",10.0
"I enjoyed the hospitality at Jose's place very much. Pointe-Claire is a suburb of Montreal but has an entirely different, laid-back feel than staying in the city center. It is well connected by bus (journey takes 45 minutes to an hour) and saves the hassle of finding parking in the city. Jose was very welcoming. We enjoyed the upgraded features in the upstairs of her home (beautiful shower, classy lighting in the bedroom, all amenities for preparing tea/coffee in the dressing room, and air conditioning!) and we enjoyed the helpful local tips from Jose herself -- a great experience.",10.0
"We had a most wonderful stay with Jose! The location of her home is right in the heart of the enchanted Pointe-Claire village: the sprawling lakefront is 2 minutes down her street, and all the charming amenities of the main street are 2 minutes up from her home. Jose is the epitome of hospitable, welcoming, and helpful. She's a pleasure to interact with and her home was a pleasure to stay in. We look forward to our next stay with you, Jose!",10.0
"The house is cute and comfortable. The rooms are bright and the view of the neighborhood is quaint. The king-size bed feels like a cloud, I haven’t been that comfy in I don’t know how long. The extra bedroom is also cute and looks like it would be perfect for traveling with a child (even without AC). The windows in the home are usually open, letting in a very nice breeze off of the lake. The bathroom is aesthetically pleasing and very clean. The host (Jose) is very helpful and kind and informative. She has newspaper clips and brochures of things that are in the area and gave us tips on things to do. Her home is right at the shore and a windmill from 1709, so the walks always seem to have an amazing view, especially accompanied by some ice cream from a little shop around the corner from her place. The town seems to have a very safe feel, to the point that you could be comfortable sending your children out to play without worry. I would recommend this home and host to anyone. Definitely an experience I am glad I took the time for.",10.0

"We were very happy with John's place as it is in an ideal location. It is walking distance to the metro and to Old Montreal, which is great for anyone visiting the city. The check-in was simple and seamless. The apartment itself had everything that was needed and I liked the fact that there were several toiletries available for use in case you forgot anything (shampoo, conditioner etc.). However, the apartment faces another building so there is not much of a view if you are looking for that. That being said, location cannot be beat and for the most part we only came back to the apartment for sleep. All in all this was a great experience and we appreciate John's timely responses whenever we had a question. Thank you for your hospitality!",10.0

Andreanne is excellent at communication and has the best possible setup for both short-term and long-term stays. I would definitely stay here again.,9.0
"I enjoyed my first Airbnb experience staying at Andreanne's home. The private entrance, bathroom, sitting area, and bedroom that could lock made me feel secure and like I had my own space. The house is so close to the metro station that I used transit for my whole four-day visit and that saved a lot of money. She was generous and had a reloadable transit card, travel guides, milk and coffee available. Everything was clean and welcoming. Being so close to the Olympic Stadium and all of its activities made it easy to check out the attractions and there is a Cineplex movie theatre right there too. Nice when travelling with children. She was always responsive to my questions and texted back quickly. I would recommend without a doubt for anyone who wants an easy, enjoyable experience.",9.0

"Andréanne is an excellent communicator and went out of her way to accommodate us. We arrived late and she organized our check-in very well. The space is beautiful, better than the pictures and has everything you would need. It feels kind of like a little apartment in the basement, and it does have a separate entrance to the basement, making things even more private. I liked this because I felt I could go in and out at night without bothering Andréanne and her family. The neighborhood had plenty of parking and was quiet but a short drive to everything.",9.0

"The apartment is perfectly situated in the heart of Plateau Mt-Royal: the Mt-Royal metro station, groceries, and restaurants are just a few steps away. The host was responsive to our needs, providing a phone so we could make calls using our Magic Jack via the internet as no landline is available. We rented for one month and Martin was an excellent host.",10.0
"This is a very quaint, comfortable 1-bedroom apartment on the main floor of a typical Montreal row house. It is located in a great area of the city - Le Plateau - where you are surrounded by quiet streets for strolling, trendy bars, cafés and restaurants, and unique shopping that Montreal is known for. We drove to Montreal and overnight street parking was readily available, once you figured out the signage and what sections of the street were non-permit. The neighbours were also very helpful to point out when we got it wrong, saving us a potential ticket!! Martin was nice to deal with. Although we didn't get to meet in person, communication with him was easy - phone, text, email and through AirBNB. Check-in and out was easy, and we felt very safe and secure. The apartment has an alarm system and we were introduced on paper to the upstairs neighbour, who we then met in person over the course of the weekend. The apartment is clean and the beds are comfortable. The bedroom is large (king size bed) and is off the front side of the house, but the street is fairly quiet, so street noise wasn't an issue. There is no central air conditioning, but a fan in the bedroom and portable A/C unit in the living room. We were there on a very hot, sticky weekend, and didn't find the apartment overly hot, nor did we need the A/C. Although well equipped, we didn't do any cooking in the kitchen, apart from making tea. But we did prepare a nice snack of wine, cheese, crackers, meat, grapes… which we enjoyed sitting out on the quiet and sunny back deck area. Having this outside space was very nice. The apartment is also equipped with a washer/dryer - so handy for longer stays. Decent shower/tub with good water pressure - there is no exhaust fan though, so the room does steam up, making it a bit hard to towel dry. The only real quirk for us... the toilet is in a small ""closet"" at the front of the house - literally just room for the toilet - while the shower/tub/sink is in a separate room at the back of the house. So you have to walk through the dining/living room & kitchen to wash your hands after using the toilet. Looking back at the photos, we can see this now, but it is not obvious and was a bit of a surprise for us. Overall though, we were very happy with the apartment. Great price, great location, great weekend!",10.0
"The place is super cozy. Very clean and spacious. Close to the metro station, shared bikes stations, supermarkets, and lots of restaurants. Everything you need is within easy reach. The BBQ station is a lot of fun, especially considering the great selection of amazing sausage at the European market on St.Laurent which is just 10 minutes away by bike. Martin (the host) was very welcoming and helpful. There was a problem with Wi-Fi, he quickly arranged the fix. Great overall experience!",10.0
"Martin is an extra host, very welcoming and available. We lived there for two exceptional months, where we immediately felt very good because he emanates great serenity and is very warm. It's ideally located in the heart of Plateau, right next to the metro, many beautiful parks, and a multitude of good shops. We especially loved enjoying the terrace and barbecue! In short, we would recommend this accommodation without hesitation to all our loved ones and thank Martin and Sarah for their hospitality!",10.0
"Martin is an amazing host. He is very communicative and available. Check-in was easy and the place is truly a zen house. I used to live in Montreal so the new location was best for those wanting to live the local life, but his place is truly next to everything. From wonderful brunch places less than 2 blocks away to fresh daily croissants to bars to restaurants to the metro... I could go on.

When we arrived, Martin had left us personal notes about the place, with his phone number, a map of the city, trash day during the week and other useful information. We were able to find parking on the street without using parking permits, but he had left us parking permits in case we needed them at a very affordable fee. The place was spotless and I felt it was bigger than the pictures showed. There was lots of storage for your clothes as the closets were empty and ready to use. I will definitely come back to this place next time I come back to Montreal for sure. Martin is very friendly and available, and his place is wonderful. Some mentioned that the toilet is a separate room from the shower and sink, which is true, but it didn't bother me. I didn't use the BBQ, but it's a brand new big one, better than the one shown in the pictures.

Martin's place is the best place to live the local life while staying in a stress-free very quiet place next to absolutely everything. If you're into road noise, construction driving you crazy and high rises, go downtown. If you want the true Montreal experience, stay at the zenhouse. 

Thanks Martin for the wonderful hospitality and great stay!",10.0

"Martins' place was perfect for our 4-day stay. The location is superb; we were able to walk out the front door and find great restaurants, cocktail bars, and cafes within a 5-minute walk. We found that we walked everywhere from his place, even to Old Port.

The beds were both so comfortable that we fell asleep straight away. The townhouse was clean and beautiful. There is even a private terrace with a BBQ which would be lovely in the summer.

The kitchen was well equipped for any type of cooking, unless you can't stop yourself from eating out.

The location of the apartment is ideal, in the Plateau neighborhood where we can find everything nearby, young and dynamic with the metro station at 500m, two stations from Berry UQAM (the main metro station).  The apartment is decorated tastefully, bright, clean and I could go on... We feel like home (sometimes a little too much to the point of not wanting to move). Unfortunately, we didn't get to see Martin but he was always very responsive whenever I had a question, it was perfect. You can go there with your eyes closed.  Have a good trip everyone.",10.0

"The landlord is friendly and the apartment is well located near McGill University with a nice view. The room I had was spacious, square, bright, and comfortable. In essence, the description and photo match. The main problem is the miserable hygiene! Everywhere in the apartment, starting from the entrance, it's dirty, untidy, torn boxes are scattered around, food remnants in the kitchen everywhere, no cleanliness in the bathroom, dirty laundry, used underwear on the floor, my room was filthy and I couldn't shake off the feeling that my bedding and towels weren't freshly washed, even if it might have had insects like roaches or mites in bed, which is difficult to prove. Montreal is beautiful but I will not stay at this accommodation again!",9.0
"A room that completely matches the description and a correct mattress. 

However, a bathroom that hasn't been cleaned in six months, a pair of underpants left trailing on the floor for two days, and a pile of trash cans on the balcony are surprising!

The low prices brought us here and we don't regret it, but don't expect too much...",9.0
"Great place! It's just as described - my room was big and comfortable, I could control my own heat which was great, and the location is excellent. The hosts were communicative even if I didn’t see them, sending emails checking to see how things were and to give me info on the house, and even a credit for a local electric car taxi company! You won't have access to a common space and remember that you have to share the bathroom with a few people, but with those in mind this is a great stay and I recommend it!",9.0

Good place for single male university-aged travelers. Very close to everything and the university.,9.0
"Simple hostel-style accommodation, nice people running the place who gave great travel tips that were very helpful. Some noise from other guests and hosts so it's not totally peaceful but as long as you're using it as a base to explore the city and not as a home for any period of time it will suit your needs perfectly.",9.0
"The room is clean, spacious, and organized. The house is located in a fantastic spot, incredibly quiet and within walking distance of Old Town and Mount Royal. The host is extremely helpful and kind. I highly recommend this place for staying and enjoying the beautiful city of Montreal.",9.0
"We only stayed for one night, so we couldn't meet the hosts or experience the ""vibe"" of the place. 

The room is as depicted in the photos. Clean and spacious. However, it is worth keeping in mind that the other areas of the house, namely, the bathroom and kitchen are shared with many other people. Thus, it is hard to keep them clean. 

They have a cat, which we were not aware of, but he is really nice and friendly. 

The location was very good; it provides free parking right in front of the place, which made it easier for us.",9.0
Really intended housing for young tenants. Very well located in the city center. Good atmosphere,9.0
Wonderful hosts at a great location!

"The place was fine and lived up to its advertisement. You get what you pay for; the room is nice at a low price. The bathrooms were okay, the shower handle fell off so it was difficult to use and it wasn't working one morning. The cat is cute. 

The hosts were nice but loud late at night when I was trying to sleep, and the kitchen was always full of dirty dishes. I would not stay here again.",9.0

All nights there were lots of talking outside, which made it difficult to sleep, but otherwise everyone was very nice.",9.0
"It's a good place to spend one night for a cheap price. The room is nice and not far from the university, Mont Royal, and downtown. The hosts are also very kind but they talked until late at night when I was trying to sleep. Except for that, it's okay.  I recommend this house to you.",9.0

"Accurate description of the room we rented. The rented room is fairly clean, but the shared bathroom is dirty. The bathtub is slippery due to lack of proper cleaning. The shower knob broke and fell each time I took a shower. The location is good, and parking is good. Oh! One of the four nights we stayed was pretty loud around midnight and lasted for a couple of hours. My partner got out of bed and walked to the kitchen just so they knew we were already in. Unfortunately, the noise level went down for a bit and then back up again.",9.0
Excellent communication and beautiful room in a nice area.,9.0
disappointed,9.0
"These guys are very nice and friendly hosts, and they have a very cute cat to welcome you.

The location is the biggest plus as it's just a 5-10 minute walk to Eaton Centre and other places downtown.

Some things that were mentioned by previous guests but weren't fixed by the host include:
* The kitchen sink had unwashed dishes from days, making it look unsanitary to stand in the kitchen with a full sink of dirty dishes.
* The shower nozzle even dislocates and comes off easily. 

I would give 10 stars for the location if I could. 

Be careful of the street parking signs, guys, as I got a $62 parking ticket for parking at the exact same spot the host asked me to park (the free parking spot) in front of the house.",9.0
"The room was clean and spacious, the bathroom was so dirty, I love cats but I did not like seeing a container with poop in front of my room.",9.0
It has a very good location. The cleaning of hallways could be improved.,9.0
"The host was very nice, friendly, and helpful. It was a pretty good location. It was an okay stay, but it would have been better if the common areas were better maintained.",9.0
Sweet place to be,9.0
"I am trying to be honest here! I checked in late and the access to the place was good, the AC was broken and not working at all as described in the listing, they have a cat, the kitchen and bathroom were horrible everywhere with women's hair. 

There are too many people living in this place and I couldn't get a shower until 11:00 AM, which is past checkout time, so I left without showering.",9.0
"The location is great, the rooms are very spacious and the atmosphere is youthful and pleasant. I think it's a great decision the detailed way they provide information about everything you might need during your stay, so you don't have to ask for it personally! Plus, they make themselves available to guests daily through this medium as a demonstration of hospitality. I highly recommend it!!",9.0

"Nice, cheap place to stay close to downtown. Quiet and clean. There's a cat that you can smell. I don't mind but if you're allergic or sensitive to cat smell you might not enjoy it. The fridge was a little gross too. The host was nice. For a short stay, it wasn't a bad spot especially for the price.",9.0

"Just perfect! 10/10, that's all there is to say!",9.0
"The location of this Airbnb was great, as it was very close to downtown. 

However, we had a strange check-in experience with another guest in the room assigned to us. In that confusion, we ended up in a different room that hadn't been cleaned. There was garbage and dirty glasses. The walls in the house were also extremely thin; we were woken up every morning by people talking loudly outside our door and even a loud barking dog on the first night (though there was no mention that animals would be present apart from the cat, who is very cute and friendly).

The shower also wasn't working; the handle had been broken off so we weren't able to take a shower (but we didn't have clean towels anyway). The front door also didn't lock. 

Overall, it was a mixed bag. The location was good but we didn't really enjoy our stay.",9.0
"Very good value for the price! 

Large and comfortable room. 

Very flexible and accommodating.",9.0
"It's an incredible place to stay, I enjoyed my time there with great hospitality.",9.0
"A very nice place with a spacious room and an easy check-in option when the host isn't there. I went for a job interview that lasted all day, so I only used the apartment to sleep for two nights. Although there was hair on the toilet and in the shower, the place was cleanish, the bed was very comfortable, and the room was very well decorated. The only complaint I have is that both nights I fell asleep early, around 10pm, and on both nights I was woken up by loud voices (mainly female) around midnight, then realized there was also a dog running around. When it happened the second night, I went out to ask the hosts to please be quiet, and they immediately became quiet. If I didn't have to get up early, I wouldn't really care, but both mornings I had to wake up super early so it was a bit of a shame to have broken sleep. Otherwise, I would recommend this place to stay if they improve what I suggested.",9.0
The place was great and everything was as advertised. Would definitely stay again anytime,9.0

Clean and very well-located apartment. Good stay,9.0
"Nice and clean place close to town. Our main issue was that we did not get any keys for our room which felt quite unsafe since there are 4 other rooms in the apartment where unknown people lived. It was unpleasant to not be able to lock the door while sleeping or being out of the house. Also, we asked for the keys both via text and by calling the emergency number. We got the information that there were no keys for the room we were staying in. After checking out though, the host contacted me to ask where I put the keys. This is not a major problem but it is very unprofessional to not provide keys to guests and then later request them for the non-exciting keys.",9.0
"The flat was lovely and very open. We were there during the hottest days of the year, and Carole had some fans set up - combined with the big windows throughout the apartment, it was perfect. There is a very cute porch outside with a cafe table and chairs - ideal for coffee in the morning. It's a pleasant 30 minute walk to the mountain/park in the center of the city, and just 10 minutes from several really great restaurants.",10.0

The apartment, ideally located, is very comfortable, clean, and modern. There is everything you need nearby for a pleasant stay: restaurants, shops, bars.

Don't hesitate to contact for an ideal stay in Montreal!",10.0

The apartment was as we imagined, bright and furnished with simplicity and good taste in a very well-served neighborhood. 
A week in a big city seemed too long to us, so we rented a car and went to the Laurentians, absolutely beautiful and worth visiting because they're not far from Montreal.

Loved our stay here! It was very clean and the beds were all comfortable to sleep in. The balcony was our favorite spot to hang out while we were at home. Carole was so helpful on a couple of occasions when we needed her to be there to accept our lost luggage that was delivered. We didn’t really see her but she was there to help us any time we asked. Such a great space! We will definitely stay again. Bixi bikes are right outside the door and the metro is a short walk away.,10.0
"A top-notch welcome, Carole is very friendly and helpful, her list of good addresses is very practical. The accommodation is convenient and beautifully decorated, we felt like home!

We had a wonderful stay and would definitely return with pleasure!",10.0
"Superb apartment in a great location, with a fantastic decor and a spacious balcony. The neighborhood is quiet yet close to everything at the same time. Our hosts were responsive and super friendly.

"A truly delightful moment,
The apartment is exactly as described. Beautifully furnished, very bright and very functional. Comfortable and well-equipped (and decorated!), it gives you the feeling of being a true Montrealer!

"This is not a 3-bedroom condo. It's false advertising. The owner added a flimsy, cheap, small inflatable mattress (that might be okay for a toddler) which doesn't count as a bed. If it did, he could leave five more of these mattresses in his closet and call it a 7-bed rental! The owner refused to help us. He stopped responding to my calls and ignored my messages.  

I would only recommend renting this if you are max four people.",9.0

"Not awful, but you can find MUCH nicer places in Montreal for the same price. I found the place to be super noisy and it smelled like mothballs.

I'm assuming this doesn't happen every night, but it might not be the safest neighborhood.",9.0

"It's more of a guesthouse/hostel than a proper home. 

Pros: Very affordable, good value, the bedrooms and common areas were clean, quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. The host is also quick to respond. 

Cons: The bedroom is quite bright at night (curtains are not thick enough to block street lights and the door is made of glass). The men's bathroom was quite dirty. I used the women's one which was clean. They are individual bathrooms, so I didn't understand why they were separated by sex.",9.0

We had a very good stay and highly recommend this Airbnb (comfortable bed, spacious room, tea available). Isabelle also sells maple syrup (homemade) at a lower cost. Jonathan and she are discreet and very friendly. They even share their best addresses in a small booklet written specifically for their guests.",10.0

Isabelle and Jonathan were very kind and provided maps and helpful tips for where to go. They were also very responsive when I called with questions. The only thing I would caution is that they wake up early, so you want to be quiet at night (but it's ok to stay out late). I would definitely stay here again!",10.0
"Extremely clean and tidy place with warmth of thoughtful touch in every corner. The hosts are very helpful with any need we have with their welcoming packet.

Perfect for a couple visiting family in Outremont.,10.0
"My husband and I stayed a total of 16 nights in Andrée's 4-room cozy and well-furnished apartment. We literally had a home away from home — breakfast on the balcony, cooking our own dinners and even having guests, helping ourselves to Andrée's amazing collection of spices, getting to know the staff at nearby Young's grocery, curling up in front of the TV, sleeping in late in the quiet, comfortable bedroom, and even trick-or-treating on Halloween since this is a residential neighborhood. Andrée's den/office was so practical that my husband actually worked too much most days, but then I could get out and shop and visit Outremont's many beautiful parks with our daughter and new baby grandson. We pushed the stroller up to the top of Mont Royal a couple times too. I loved the proximity of Mile End and Plateau. We walked there easily (coming back by Uber). To go downtown we used the metro, a 10-minute walk away. Now whenever we visit our daughter who lives in Outremont, we'll hope Andrée's very affordable place is available!",10.0
"Apartment style, fully equipped for a long stay, well located in the Outremont neighborhood, bus stops within 5 minutes, metro within 10-15 minutes. I thank Andrée again for her hospitality and availability. I recommend.",10.0
"Andrée is a very welcoming, hospitable, and accommodating person. My wife and I spent 4 days in her apartment and had a good time. The apartment is clean, sunny, and well-equipped. A place that I recommend to everyone. You won't be disappointed!",10.0
The host cancelled this reservation 67 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,10.0
"I had the pleasure of staying at Andrée's place for a week and I highly recommend it. Andrée was such an excellent, attentive host. Once I arrived, she took the time to show me her house and provide tips on places and events. The kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, and dishes so I had everything I needed to cook my meals. She also made sure everything was fine during my stay. I needed an iron board and iron for a business meeting and she gladly made them available. I really enjoyed staying in a traditional French residential neighborhood with several options of groceries, restaurants, and shops. The apartment is well located, close to the Outremont blue line station that takes you downtown in thirty minutes. It is also relatively easy to come from/go to the airport (about $30 Uber trip). The apartment has paid laundry (four loonies) in the building basement so it was a perk not to leave the building. Unfortunately, I came during the winter so the days were cloudy, snowy, and gray so I didn’t have the chance to see the greenery Montréal is famous for. The city wasn't quiet, though. Montréal en Lumière was taking place on Avenue Sainte Catherine during the weekend so I was able to check out a famous city festival. I’ll definitely be back in the summer.",10.0
"Andrée is a wonderful host and the apartment is spacious, clean, friendly and very practical. We spent 6 days there. The metro and shops are nearby. I recommend this apartment without reservation! Looking forward to going back :)",10.0

Well-located apartment near the metro and Mount Royal. Andrée is very accommodating and a perfect host. Everything was as expected and we had no unpleasant surprises. Good work,10.0
"I had a great stay at Andree's place. The flat is spacious and well laid out. I had a presentation to write and found that the balcony surrounded by pine tree branches was a perfect place for that (though Andree also has a nice office).  The neighborhood is great: quiet tree-lined streets with brownstone houses (some villas around Outremont park are particularly beautiful), and excellent cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The metro is just under 10 minutes walk, and so is Dax cafe for a morning espresso with pastry. I went to a conference at the HEC Montreal, and it was 20 minutes door-to-door. Andree herself is lovely and welcoming.  I've been to quite a lot of Airbnbs, and this is one of the best.",10.0

"Translation:  ""Wonderful stay at Andrée's place. Very warm and friendly. I highly recommend her apartment!""",10.0
"The worst part of the experience was visiting Montreal after a drive of over seven hours from the states. The host complained about our late arrival and was unhappy about our early departure. I had asked about late arrivals before booking, but she still invited me to book this place. After the late arrival happened, I apologized repeatedly, but she continued complaining to us and even blamed us for our early departure... She said this ruined her weekend plans.  I mean, if you have plans for the weekend, why invite us to book your room? Why even list availability on Airbnb? We were not staying at your place for free; we paid to stay, but we did not feel welcomed at all. It felt like we had done something wrong just by staying at her place. Also, be aware of flying spiders. 2 stars for the cozy bed",10.0
"You will enjoy your stay at Andrée's. The hospitality, the cleanliness of the place, and the host's attentiveness are all factors that will make you feel comfortable.",10.0
"Andrée was an incredible hostess. She showed me around her home personally and made sure to explain where everything was. 
The unit is in great shape, but the building is fairly old. The water pressure wasn't the best in the bathroom and the unit isn't exactly downtown. 
Those are the only things about the unit that weren't great, because everything else was perfect! It's a very rustic place that's very well kept. I felt very comfortable there, and there was a sweet, homey feel to it. I would definitely recommend staying there if you're willing to walk or commute to downtown. 
Otherwise, the area itself has many great things to offer! Andrée is also a great hostess. She answered any questions I had almost instantly.",10.0

Rene met me there upon arrival. He was very detailed yet brief in his tour of the place. He suggested a couple restaurants in the area and gave me great tips on ski mountains as well.

There's also a great breakfast spot just around the corner, only a 3-minute walk that Naima recommended. It's definitely worth trying!

The only thing we had a small issue with was finding parking, but I believe that it was mainly because of the snow and we arrived in the evening. There are plenty of free areas to park around; just need to get a spot. 

Overall, this place was exactly what we wanted and everything was great!

They provided a tour of their place and gave us some helpful tips on nearby restaurants, grocery stores, locations of the metro, etc. They were extremely kind and helpful throughout the entire experience. Always responding quickly to questions and even offering us a late checkout on our final day.

The space itself is amazing and I found the pictures did not do it justice. It truly felt much bigger in person and for 4 people it was plenty of space. It was exceptionally clean and had all amenities you would need. It is within walking distance (5-10 mins) from the metro station, pubs/breweries, restaurants, a small grocery store, and an amazing butcher shop. I would highly recommend booking their place if you are in the area!",10.0

There were restaurants within walking distance and it was a reasonable Uber ride to many of the cities popular attractions. We hope to go back during the summer!",10.0
"The location is perfect and her roommates too, but the room was not clean and everything smelled like smoke. If you know that you have an allergy to smoke, then this place is not for you.

"Great place to stay. Clean, very stylish and well thought out. Comfortable and large king-size bed. It was steps away (~90m) from Guy-Concordia (green) subway line, which was extremely convenient. We bought a $13.50 bus-subway pass valid for the entire weekend at the airport and took the 747 bus to/from the airport. We were able to go to Atwater market, Bota Bota spa, walked around beautiful Old Port, Chinatown, downtown Montreal, Le Banquise for poutine and back to the airport with this $13.50 pass. Just be careful not to lose it; it's a paper pass. We also went to Adonis (8 min walk from the place) for extra food to go along with the microgreens we bought at the market. We will definitely be back.",10.0
"The place is downtown Montreal, and close to everything. It is as shown on the website, clean and well furnished. The information was clear and accurate.

"Carl's place is in an older, unrenovated high-rise, but the apartment is tidy and spacious as the photos show, and Carl is constantly adding improvements. The bed is new and the sheets are fresh. My husband and I wanted to stay near McGill University and this was a great budget option. The metro was only a 5-minute walk away, and the Plateau is a few miles walk each way. The kitchen has a toaster and electric kettle. If you want to cook hot meals, you would have to bring all the basics, like cooking oil and salt and pepper, but...

I really liked how close the apartment was to cute coffee shops, and it's right next door to an excellent little vegetarian restaurant and a small used bookshop. Check-in was super easy and flexible to meet my needs. Carl was always ready to help when I had any questions, and his hospitality is among the best I have received from an Airbnb host. Thanks, Carl!",8.0
"I was so grateful to be able to book Carl's apartment on the day I arrived in Montreal after my previous plan fell apart.  Carl responded very quickly and made it possible for me to get to the apartment with no delay. The building is older, but the apartment itself is warm and cozy.  The bed was comfortable, and the living room very pleasant.  I did not really cook during my stay there, but I could have, as there was everything needed. Carl provided me with breakfast essentials (tea, instant coffee, and even Nutella), which was so nice. The location is perfect, especially if you want to visit McGill University. You can walk to so many places, the location is central. I will stay there again if the place is available when I come back to Montreal.",8.0
"Great host, the location is a 7-minute walk to the grocery store. There are many bars nearby, all within walking distance of the strip and everything you might need.",8.0

"Great host and very responsive. The apartment is in a fairly central location in Montreal near plenty of restaurants, cafes, and other shops. Quite accessible by public transport. Carl was responsive regarding any issues we had. Spacious and sunny living room.  The apartment is ideal if you want to cook for yourself. Highly recommended.",8.0
"Carl's place is located in the residential area of McGill. It's a good location, especially considering the price. The place itself isn't fancy, but it gets the job done. Our only real complaint is that the unit is quite cold and the heating didn't work properly - which made our winter stay somewhat difficult. However overall, Carl was an excellent host who made check-in and check-out very easy, and we would recommend this place to anyone traveling on a budget, as long as they don't mind that the place is a little worn down.",8.0

Carl's place has a great location and was really nice and clean inside. Carl was quick to reply if we had any questions as well.,8.0
"The place was the same in the picture, it's hard to find a parking spot around the area, it took us 30-45 minutes before we found one because it's downtown Montreal. There were some garbage cans on the porch but we didn't mind because we weren't using them. It turned us off when the host asked for an additional $50 cleaning fee because the cleaning service told him that we left the space ""really messy."" A few cups of Tim Hortons were left on the table because the bins were too small, which created the mess, and it wasn't worth $50 to pick them up. Disappointed with our stay.",8.0
"Convenient location, clean, great value, and great hosts! If you care about water pressure and temperature like I do, you will love this place. Better water pressure than my own house and so quick to get hot water!!! Carl and his co-host were very attentive and were ready to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is in a university area so it’s lively and there are many great eateries nearby. Subway and buses are very close too, but if you like walking you can walk to Old Montreal in 20 minutes while enjoying the scenic old streets and getting good coffee and sweets on your way. The wifi signal was a bit weak but the hosts were aware of it and tried to fix the issue. Overall I recommend this place to everyone!",8.0

"Excellent location and friendly host who is accommodating. It is very close to everything, but the place desperately needs some deep cleaning because the first thing that greets a guest is a stale food smell that won't go away. The kitchen in general, including utensils, was downright dirty. Not bad, but not a five-star residence.",8.0

"Recommended for the location, so close to downtown and Mont Royal Park. The apartment has all you need for a comfortable stay.

"Had a great time (stayed only 2 nights) in Montreal. The apartment is located in the student district, spacious, with a large TV and a small kitchen. I would recommend it for short stays!",8.0
"The location of this place is great (very central) and Carl was a good host: communication went well and we very much appreciated his flexibility around check-in and check-out times. But we were sorely disappointed with the apartment itself. Why? Because while the pictures correspond to what we were looking for, the actual place did not: the state of renovation is far from being as good as suggested by the description and pictures (ex: there was a big hole in the bathroom door, by the doorknob, that was filled with kitchen paper, and that is just one example); the place could use a deep clean and we were greeted by a hospital smell that we could not get rid of during our stay. If you are seduced by the idea of using the pool, beware: we love swimming and were planning to use it but did not because its cleanliness was very questionable (there were for example what seemed to be dead spiders at the bottom of it). This place is for people who want a place to sleep and be on their way.",8.0
"Great location, but be prepared for student housing. Good Wi-Fi. Nice furniture. However, the bathroom and kitchen are very old. The host is very responsive.",8.0
Extremely well-located location. Suitable for both short and long trips. We really enjoyed the accommodation and reception with Carl's help.,8.0
"This was in a perfect location, the apartment was a little less upscale than the photos made it appear, but it was perfect for us and our stay!",8.0
"I do not recommend this place at all. The pictures are so misleading. It looks luxurious, but it is nothing but a sham. I wish I could add in my own pictures, the actual reality of what this place looks like, for example, an improperly installed bathroom door knob stuffed with toilet paper and with visible screws. Filth on the walls, on the fan. A flimsy piece of plastic/cardboard in the top part of the window where the AC unit is installed. It felt so unsafe that we did not leave any valuables every time we left the Airbnb. 2 towels for 5 people for 3 days and 2 nights (that includes the hand towel, and there's no mat for coming out of the shower, so basically that leaves no towels for showers; we used our own towels we had brought for swimming) and when I asked for more towels, that did not happen. I was completely ignored on that request. But we ended up using our own towels because we saw a beautiful pool in the pictures. Well, turns out the pool wasn't as expected at all. It was too cold to swim and the place looked like it needed repairs (holes in the ceiling) just bad! 
The dresser had a broken drawer bottom, when I attempted to open the closet in the bedroom, the knob came off in my hand, the closet door wasn't aligned properly and difficult to manage. The toilet didn't flush properly, the bathroom sink was leaking, and the caulking in the bathroom was coming apart and either dirty or moldy. The walls were filthy; I could see where posters had been on those walls in the past. Gross. 

This is so dishonest. This is not right. 
Awful. Awful. Awful. 
You want to rent your place, that's fine. Don't need to steal from honest people. Just sell what you have to offer, don't mislead people and on top of it bully them into giving you a five-star rating. I paid. Therefore, I have paid my right to say my honest opinion, and I don't want anyone else to get ripped off by you.",8.0
"It is a clean and comfortable place to live, and the host replies to messages very quickly.

"We booked this Airbnb for a group of 4 guests. Check-in was a fast and easy process. Upon arrival, we were very satisfied with how neat and clean the furniture and apartment were. We enjoyed the location - walking distance to major sites in the city (St. Laurent, downtown Montreal, Mount-Royal Hiking Trail, and a 10-minute drive to Old Port Montreal). Carl was very helpful in providing us with suggestions on places to visit/dine, and responded quickly to calls and texts! The furniture was nice; one bedroom with a bed and couch, living room with a pull-out couch, TV, and dining table, kitchen, and patio available. The infrastructure of the apartment and building was a bit old. The apartment was located in a safe area to walk in at night. Overall, we had an amazing stay, and would recommend it for short stays.",8.0
"Great location, but requires maintenance.",8.0
Perfect location for our visit to McGill for their open house! We were comfortable and enjoyed the neighborhood very much. Plug for Lola Rosa restaurant!!!! Carl's place was just what we needed! Carl was very good at communicating and kept in touch throughout our visit. Make sure you get all his texts/messages before you arrive so you are informed about parking and access to the apartment. We drove from quite a distance and couldn't download all of them before we arrived...all worked out just fine. Thanks for a great weekend in Montreal!,8.0
"Carl's place is within walking distance of everything you want to visit in Montreal. It is a little smaller and less luxurious than it appears in the pictures, as it is a student residence. However, overall it was a pleasant trip if you are looking for home for one person or even more.",8.0
"I had a nice stay at Carl's place! Communication was perfect, check-in was easy. The house was super clean, the bed was very comfortable. The location is also good, close to the subway and stores. The little patio is perfect if you smoke.

As other reviewers have said, it's a nice place with some old features but the location, responsiveness from host and parking all make up for that! The decor is new and modern and the bed was really comfortable! I would definitely stay here again (maybe in the summer when it's not so cold)! Also check-in and check-out were SO easy and convenient!",8.0
"The place matched the pictures exactly. The balcony was actually very spacious. The TV also had Spotify and YouTube on it, so it was perfect because we didn't need to use our speakers to listen to music. It was very close to McGill as well as shopping and a SAQ (liquor store).",8.0
"The photos are misleading - the apartment is old and fairly shabby with new Ikea furniture. Also - it's freezing (my phone said the inside temp was 12 degrees C)! We cranked the heat and I still could not sleep because I was so cold. I almost wore my coat to bed. I wish I had. For the location (close to McGill) and the price point, I'm not surprised. It's an old building that desperately needs updating. Some fairly simple repairs are neglected in favor of shoving plastic bags and toilet paper into crevices or hiding them behind paintings. If you're only worried about location and price, it's a decent place to stay (maybe not in winter though). We were just looking for a warm place to wait out a snowstorm and unfortunately we were very disappointed since we were still so cold! Check-in was a breeze and Carl was very quick to respond and easily reachable.",8.0

"Ivonne's place was clean and beautiful, and I had the place to myself, which was great. She had an alarm system so I felt safe, and it was easy to check-in. The location was great, in the middle of the Plateau. The only issue, which was quite disappointing, is that her place did not provide wifi, although it said on the website that it was part of the amenities. It was also annoying that she didn't warn me about this and that it took her a long time to tell me, and I had to text and ask her multiple times before she told me that it had been cut off. This was frustrating for me since I was apartment hunting and thus depended on wifi for this. She also stated she would reimburse me for this but has not yet done so after several weeks. I understand she was traveling at the time, but I would have appreciated better communication about this. If there hadn't been issues with the wifi or communication, I wouldn't have any more complaints about her place.",9.0
"Ivonne's place is located in a central area within a small gated community in the city. The gates, keyless locks, and security alarm provide an extra layer of security. It was easy to access buses/trains and local taxis. There are also countless places to eat, grab dessert, or grab a drink in the area. The place is modern and clean. The bed is extra firm and pillows are very soft, so keep that in mind. There are two small windows in the room, but due to their high location, they cannot be opened for light/air. 

I did not get a chance to meet Ivonne because she was on vacation during my stay. However, she is fairly responsive via text. 

Also, please clarify amenities with Ivonne prior to your check-in, as there was no Wi-Fi or cable TV as listed in her apartment amenities. She also did not have the apartment cleaned until the second day I was there. She stated it was due to a call out from the cleaners' side, but she failed to leave me instructions for where I could find bedding/towels in the meantime. Luckily, I just opened the room door closest and saw extra sheets and towels. 

After all is said and done, Ivonne did offer me a small discount for the lack of initial cleanliness and lack of Wi-Fi and TV in the apartment, but her attitude was a bit nonchalant overall, which annoyed me initially.",9.0

"Ivonne's place is the place you are looking for, very modern, with huge air conditioning being a bonus, especially when we know how humid and hot Montreal gets in July.

There is only one downside which is the internet, with the internet it would be a 5-star place. Would I stay there again? Big yes and definitely.",9.0

"This experience was an eye-opener. You get what you pay for. Coming from Western Canada the communication was iffy with translation issues. This seemed to be resolved before we left. The host was made aware when we would be arriving...early evening. We arrived at the door in this unknown neighborhood, and after calling and texting many times over a 2 hour period without a reply, were starting to wonder if we had been scammed. Finally the door was buzzed open and we went to the unit. We did not meet or see our host until the 5th night. The accommodations were modern, a type of industrial Ikea look with cement ceilings and clean and simple design. The bed is a mattress on the floor which proved to be very uncomfortable, along with terrible pillows. There was no table and chairs to sit at, rather just a couch and chair. The TV/cable do not work. We asked about the tv several times during our stay via text and phone call, but were ignored without a response. The fridge freezer motor is very loud. There were no paper towels, or clean towel or dish rag available., as well as no coffee maker(if you are a coffee person that is hard in the morning) Many cupboards in the kitchen were closed off from access. There also is no garbage can other than a small one in the bathroom. The ad suggests and implies that you get the entire unit to use, but once there you really feel that it is just a place to sleep and shower. Parking is a premium to find and may require several trips around several blocks before locating a spot. This seems to be normal for Montreal and eventually you get accustomed to it. Patience is required. All in all, it was a place to sleep, but we would not return.",9.0
Nice,9.0
Great value and superior hospitality,9.0
"It is quite the commute to everything we wanted to see around Old Montreal and the Gay Village, however it makes up for it because Serge's nightly price is UNREAL with how AMAZING it is. Serge is pretty much a hands-off Airbnb host (which is ideal for me personally) unless you ask him a question which he replies in minutes. Such a kind person. I would recommend this site if you are looking for affordability and don't mind a 30 minute commute from North Montreal to downtown South Montreal.",9.0

At utensil level, we only had one glass for two, three cups. No condiments (neither salt nor pepper), no tablets for the dishwasher, nor for the washing machine. 
Quite far from the center, it takes about twenty minutes to reach the metro, a half hour to Mount Royal. Bus stops nearby. Shops are also close by, very convenient.
After all, the price is really attractive!",10.0

"Sandra and Gustavo's accommodation is very nice and private. 

My husband and I stayed here for a week and it was quite comfortable. 

We were there during the cold season and they went above and beyond to make us feel at home in every way.

There are many places nearby to eat, and it is well connected by buses, although the metro isn't exactly close.

There are supermarkets and everything we needed for a grand stay.",10.0
"Sonders place came with hotel amenities. Little shampoos and little body washes. Everything was wiped down and the location was perfect! Right across the street from the Metro and right on the main bar drag of gay village. I would say this is not an ideal location if you need a lot of quiet sleep. I travel with earplugs so I was fine but the floor does vibrate until 0300 with the club right below. Stay here if you don't mind the noise or will be out most nights anyway, it is perfect for a weekend getaway with friends! I was visiting when 15 cm of snow fell and Sonders gave me the option of staying another night when I messaged explaining. I didn't need the extra night, but it was definitely an accommodation that made my stay stress free. They had tea and small olive oil packets available for cooking. The kitchen was stocked with every pan and cookie sheet needed. My only complaint would be the booking process. Sonders is an investment travel company. So when you book through Airbnb you aren't done there. You have to validate yourself with their systems and surveys. Save your time and just book on their website. I would stay here and try other Sonders Properties in the future. Safe travels!",9.0

"Overall very positive experience with this apartment. Very clean space and bathrooms. It provides everything needed for a weekend stay (kitchen supplies, towels, soap, shampoo).

"This place is ideal for both sociable and introverted folks alike - the space is definitely communal-centric, but there's also a nice outdoor porch in the back and people are sweet. It's a lively space at night because it's above a bar, but I slept like a babe, no problem. The bar downstairs doesn't have much of a beer selection, but they're more known for their cocktails and mixed drinks (very good, by the way!). Definitely a place I'll go next time I'm in Montreal.",10.0

"What you see on the website is exactly how you will find the space in person. Definitely a good value for money, very clean, decor and personal touches are amazing, perfect for small groups! Ask for parking instructions in advance and if there are any events in the vicinity that block the street. This will save you time upon your arrival.",10.0
"Gorgeous space, very clean, great amenities, and responsive hosts with lots of recommendations for fun in the city. Great location. They seem to have thought of every detail when designing this hostel. Beds have privacy curtains, individual lights and fans, and mattresses are fairly comfortable. However, this is NOT FOR LIGHT SLEEPERS! (You know who you are.) The bar below plays loud music every night until 4 a.m. Though the space is well insulated, nothing can block out the thumping bass (including earplugs or noise canceling headphones, which is usually adequate for me in most hostels.) The hosts are thoughtful and offered to talk to the bartenders about the noise but it still kept me up every night. They did also offer to refund my money for my remaining night’s stay if I preferred to find a hotel due to the noise, but we ended up staying as we couldn’t find an affordable alternative.  I would recommend this place so long as you are not a light sleeper (my friend slept fine though says she’s a very heavy sleeper), but I will probably not stay here again for that reason. It was otherwise an enjoyable stay. It’s a beautiful space and most folks will probably sleep fine.",10.0

Lana's place was very beautiful and close to the city. We loved staying at her house and she was very helpful with any questions we had during our stay.,10.0
"Though we appreciated the comfortable beds in this home, we likely wouldn't stay here again. The home doesn't have a bathtub (it's not the host's fault; it's not advertised as having a bathtub; I simply assumed it would) and for our entire weeklong stay, we either weren't given the key to the laundry room or the one washing machine in the laundry room wasn't working. For a family with two young kids, this was unfortunate. The kitchen is modestly equipped, and there are a few little broken things throughout the unit. We're grateful for Lana's hospitality, but this just wasn't the right fit for us.",10.0

"We were disappointed with our stay at Lana's place. Although Lana was quite friendly and responsive, there were many things wrong with the place which made our stay unpleasant. First, the location is very inconvenient as it is far from downtown and in a bad area without many nearby amenities. Next, the actual place itself did not look as nice as it did in the pictures. The bathroom and living room were smaller than expected. Worse of all, there were no drawers or tables in the bedroom forcing us to put our things on the floor. In the morning, we couldn't sleep as there were no blinds closing the window, only a sheer cloth. When we tried to cook, the dishes and pans were unwashed. Overall, we were very disappointed and would not stay again.",10.0

"This was our first experience with an Airbnb and Lana's place was perfect. I am very particular about cleanliness as well as the quality of bedding, and it was all perfect. The townhouse is newly renovated and looks fabulous, and the quality of the sheets on the beds, as well as having duvets, was very much appreciated. My husband along with my two teenage boys were very happy that everyone had their own space. Lana was great with her quick responses when I had a question. I would definitely recommend Lana's place! Thank you Lana for a fabulous stay!",10.0
Lana's townhouse was the perfect place for our family to stay while we visited family in the West Island. Don't be fooled by the outside of the building - the inside has been updated wonderfully. Access and location were easy and central to everything we needed. Perfect for our family of four. Kids had their own rooms and they loved the toys and the Foosball table! I can't imagine spending more per night to stay in a tiny hotel room for five days. We will definitely be back!,10.0

"My husband and I stayed here last weekend and loved it. It's right in the heart of old Montreal which is perfect for midnight strolls. The place was exactly what it was advertised and it was very clean - which is the most important thing to me being a clean freak. Frederick and Kloe were very responsive and accommodating, and if we go back to Montreal I would definitely stay there again. Checking in was easy. We actually stayed in for dinner one night and the place has all the basic appliances, cutlery, etc that worked out nicely. It was also surprisingly quiet on the street side as I was nervous the roaming of the cars would keep me up all night. I imagine there are a few Airbnb units in that building so once in a while you do hear loud and inconsiderate guests yelling in the corridors. But it's not that often. If there was one thing I could change is the size of the bed as I'm used to larger beds but that is just me being picky. :)",10.0

"Frederick's place is certainly at the best spot in Old Town Montreal, literally right next to the Basilica Notre-Dame. This place is spotless and has lots of natural light. I had a great time relaxing at his place and exploring nice restaurants, bakeries, and breweries in Old Town within a 5-10 minute walk. It's a vibrant place where you can feel the fun atmosphere from the plaza and on the street. Late nights on weekends could be too noisy if you like to sleep in a really quiet room. Overall, this is a great place in Old Town Montreal. I highly recommend it.",10.0
"Excellent location, three beautiful apartments",10.0
"Fantastic location in Old Montreal. Very easy to find and get into. It seems like most of the building, if not all, are Airbnb units and that the host owns a few of them. I didn't have any problems with the building or room key access. The walls are very thin and I could hear the neighbors doing things like using the bathroom and opening/closing the blinds but thankfully that's the only noise we had to deal with and it wasn't a big deal.

The air mattress was easy to set up (it has a built-in pump) and there were plenty of linens to make the bed with. The bed and the air mattress were comfortable. The duvets are thin but warm. The air mattress was easy to deflate and put away.

The shower has really good flow and the water is nice and warm. The handheld unit leaks a bit of water even when it's not activated, so be careful that you have it pointed well away from the shower door or else it will leak onto the floor as a few inches of the door seal are ripped/missing.

I didn't use the kitchen at all so I can't comment on it. The only thing I did notice though is that there is no microwave, but there is one of those small toaster ovens and an actual oven if you need it.

We had an issue the first night with the heat and had a cold night and morning. There was a lot of back and forth with the host as they weren't understanding me when I was telling them that the thermostat wouldn't let me set it higher than 20, but they solved the problem by the next night (they provided me with details on how to reset the thermostat so now it can be set higher than 20) so hopefully it won't be a problem going forward for anyone else.

Overall a decent stay. It's a bare bones place but it's worth it for the location. If you're there for at least a few days pick up some extra toilet paper as they don't leave you a lot and bring some shopping bags so you can change the bathroom garbage.",10.0

"Mohamad's place was exactly as expected. Very clean, spacious, and located in a good location. My only issue was that at the time of booking, I informed him multiple times I would not be arriving until after midnight but he kept on insisting keeping the check-in time at 9 pm and to update him later if anything changes.

Eventually, closer to the date I informed him again I would not be arriving until after midnight and he told me unless I found someone to check in on my behalf I would not be able to check in until 10 am the next day. Thankfully, I had a friend in Montreal who could help me but it would’ve caused major problems for me if I didn’t. I wish he could’ve informed me of this at the time of booking as he was aware of my schedule.

Other than that, everything else went smoothly and communication was fast. I would recommend staying here.",10.0
My friends and I stayed at Mohamad's place for a weekend in December and it was a great experience. The place is very nice and clean and is in a great location downtown. He replies right away if you have any questions just text him. We had no issues with our stay.,10.0

"James' place was great for us, cheap and just enough. It's extremely close to everything and has parking! The view is fantastic. We didn't stay in the Airbnb much but the building is quiet and safe which was what we were looking for. The shower water temp jumps around a bit but pressure is good. The bedroom gets warm in the mornings, James let us know this when we arrived, and there was air conditioning and heating which was perfect. The parking is safe and secure as is the front door. For guests looking for a lockbox, we had to meet the host for the key. From there getting in and out of the building is easy. Thanks!",9.0
"Quiet place with a clear view of Montreal and a private balcony. The decor is mainly from the 1980s but definitely has its charm.

James is a dedicated and responsive host, you can count on him!",9.0

One other note: the walls are apparently pretty thin.",9.0

"James was a wonderful host and incredibly responsive. The place was exactly as described, and we took full advantage of the great balcony by having breakfast there every morning. It was the perfect size for the two of us. The place is also very convenient if you're planning on hiking up to Mont Royal and close enough to the shopping district on Sherbrooke if you're looking for places to shop or eat. James also has great suggestions if you're looking for anything in the area. Thanks, James! Hope we can come back again when we decide to return to Montreal!",9.0

"James is a fantastic host, and his space reflects that! Great location with a nice view from the balcony. 

The only warning is that his neighbor is eccentric and possibly mentally unstable. She started banging on our wall excessively when we made some noise at 8:30 in the morning and then told James that we were up at 6am doing all sorts of things while we were sleeping...  
Not necessarily the place to go if you plan on making any noise in the bedroom. Otherwise, it was great with lots of instructions and information.",9.0
"I rented the house for 20 days for my parents who were visiting me in Montreal. We liked the location and the view very much. The price wasn't too high. The experience was okay but not the best experience I've had with Airbnb places. Some complications occurred, and the host expected my collaboration in solving the problem. The internet didn't work for the first three days, and it took the host some time to accept that there was a problem and solve it. The host was friendly and apologized when I expressed my dissatisfaction with something but not as respectful as what I expected. For example,  when I went to pick up the keys, he was still busy cleaning the bathroom and doing the laundry, and he jokingly asked me to help him with preparing the house.",9.0

Everything we needed was there - plenty of towels, bedding and all the basics in the kitchen to prepare some quick meals. The air conditioning was awesome - Never thought we would need it in mid September but sure did this year. Location is a bit outside the center which didn't matter to us as we were visiting relatives in the area. Only 5 min walk to the subway though - so one could get downtown easily. Great communication with host and easy check-in.",9.0

Charlene even went out of her way to recommend a great local live music bar for us to enjoy during our New Year's celebration. The room is located at the front of the apartment, and it's a good size. The futon bed provided requires caution not to put too much weight on one side - we learned this the hard way. We both fell off the bed while sitting on one side of it.",10.0

Clean, well maintained, and in the kitchen there were all the appliances you would need to cook. Omar's studio was close to major avenues and the metro station as well. The location alone was exactly what I was looking for. There were so many restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques and pubs nearby. There is also a grocery store close by to pick up a few things if you wish. All the top attractions are within walking distance as well. This area is very safe. In all, my stay was wonderful!

About a 5-10 minute walk to the closest Metro station. Given the weekend (Canadian Grand Prix), the value was acceptable. It did get a bit stuffy, as it's a 3rd floor unit with no AC, but wasn't a huge issue given the gorgeous weather during our stay.",9.0

The apartment is perfect! Everything matches the photos and description. The bathroom has an enormous Italian shower. The bed is 160 cm of good quality. We stayed during the heatwave and the accommodation was pleasant because it was cool (very welcome after a long day of sightseeing). To reach the ""Sauvé"" metro station, you need to count about ten minutes at most on foot. Then, about twenty minutes to reach the ""Champs de Mars"" station, and it costs $6 each way. The neighborhood is quiet and you can park for free in front of the house. Mathilde is a young mom so we can hear the children playing but it remains very acceptable. On the other hand, we hear more the bathroom drain noises from above, but that's still okay. 

We recommend this accommodation without reservation as it gave us complete satisfaction.",10.0

"I stayed at Mathilde's studio for one month. 

For those who wish to book several weeks:  Know that my choice was quick as she was the only one in all of Montreal offering an entire studio (apartment) near a subway station and also offered a significant discount for long-term bookings. Much cheaper than many landlords elsewhere.

My impression: I really liked this studio, which was very cozy and clean. It's located in a truly quiet neighborhood and easy to park in front at any time. Recently renovated, you will feel very comfortable and at ease.  Possibility of dimming lights (bathroom, bedroom, etc), which I loved the most :) 

Communication: Mathilde responds with great kindness and promptness to your messages and questions, and ensures that you have everything you need.

"Great price/quality. Cedric is a very friendly and social host. Some shared rooms were a bit messy but overall we had 3 good nights at the place. It is between Mount Royal, Old Montreal, and the Olympic Park area, so ideal if you want to see all of Montréal. Public transport is very easy and we recommend renting a bike for $5 a day. Both options are very close to Cedric’s place.",10.0

"The location and floor-to-ceiling windows are the selling points of this place. Mohammed is easy to communicate with and quick to respond. It ranks better than average amongst the places I've stayed in Montreal, and it's centrally located to most downtown highlights. It offers a better price than many, but lacks some amenities. Overall, we had a good time here.",10.0

"Great spot! Heart of downtown. Parking isn't fun or cheap, but that's expected downtown. Living room with floor-to-ceiling windows is great. It can be a bit hard to sleep in on sunny days with the light curtains, but when closed, the windows block out all the noise really well. The host is very accommodating and quick to respond!",10.0

Mohammed is a great communicator and ensured everything we needed was taken care of promptly.

Best location in that area and would highly recommend it to anyone. 

Thanks again!!!",10.0
"The location was good. However, the interior was a bit run down; the furniture seemed low quality and the beds broke when we sat on them. There were also water issues as there was no water when we woke up in the morning. The host was kind enough to refund 50% of the amount charged.",10.0
Great place with great location,10.0
"We were a group of graduate students from Southwestern Ontario visiting Montreal for the first time for a conference. From the get-go, Mohammed was a great host. He got back to us within a few minutes and was great with all of our questions. The process of checking in was a breeze and the key was waiting for us. There were lots of towels, pillows, blankets, and other essentials. The beds were comfortable, there were lots of windows which allowed for natural light, and the space was very inviting! When we booked, the amenity ""breakfast included"" was on the list (accidentally), and because of this mix-up, Mohammed had breakfast delivered to us. It was delicious and very kind of him! The location is prime -- it is right near everything! There is a Starbucks right next door and a convenience store a couple of doors down. It's close to shopping sites on Rue Saint Catherine, including a large Forever 21. Uber was very accessible with this location! It was our first time ever using Airbnb and we had a great experience. Thank you to Mohammed! Recommend this as a place to stay in Montreal!",10.0
"This place is a fabulous find and an amazing value! Walking distance to museums, many delicious restaurants, and all types of shopping. It's great for a family with kids and has three queen-sized beds that are very comfortable. Mohammed was incredibly helpful and responded to messages very quickly. We would absolutely stay here again!",10.0
Very spacious apartment. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Mohammed was very accommodating with his quick responses to any questions or concerns we had. Great location!,10.0
"Mohammed was extremely responsive and very hospitable. He gave us an extra set of keys upon request and arranged to fix an issue with one of the beds as soon as we reported it. The location of the apartment is excellent. It's right in the heart of the Golden Mile and was close to the conference center that I needed. My only concerns were the upkeep of the furniture/kitchen. Some of it was worn or in disrepair. It seemed like people might be smoking in the unit as well (we are non-smokers so the smell was very obvious to us). However, even with these limitations, we were very comfortable and enjoyed this space.",10.0
This place was in the IDEAL location. Super cute and cozy - perfect for a weekend getaway. We loved the big windows and two bathrooms. There was also shampoo and conditioner and a hair dryer. The stove was under construction but we didn't need it. Will definitely recommend this place!,10.0
Nice place and location,10.0
A comfortable and perfectly located place in the city.,10.0
"The location was amazing and super close to downtown. The bedding was super soft and the beds were very comfortable! This place has the potential to be incredible! Beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows throughout. The bedroom with one bed could use some blackout blinds as it gets very bright very early (6am!). Mohammed did provide a sleep mask and now I understand why! There are some small things that I think could be added to improve this condo! Things like adding a towel rack with hand towels in the bathrooms, fixing the drop in the floors in the bathrooms (stubbed my toe a few times at night), fixing the missing oven cover, fixing the drawer in the kitchen (as was mentioned to me after we arrived) and the broken handles on the bathroom cupboards would make a huge difference in this place! For the price, this place is definitely worth it. The location itself made for a fabulous stay. Other than a few minor details, we loved the place and would definitely stay again.",10.0
"Mohammed was very responsive: buzzed us into the place immediately, shared a second set of keys upon request and quickly. The only reason the review is not five stars is that the place was a bit worn (loose fixtures, limited kitchenware). Overall, we were very pleased with the stay, location, value, and certainly the host's responsiveness.",10.0
"The place was expected. It was well-furnished. Although the kitchen could be better equipped, overall it was a spacious apartment located right in the heart of downtown.",10.0
Mohammed was an excellent host. He was quick to respond and answer any questions I had during my stay! We were a group of girls celebrating a bachelorette weekend (the two bathrooms were key) and the place was in a very good location downtown. It was also spacious and comfortable. It offered great value and I would highly recommend it to anyone.,10.0
"The location was absolutely fantastic! The place was very nice and clean. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that parking was a bit hard to find at times, leading to a lot of driving around or an overnight parking lot that costs $30, which can add up. Otherwise, our stay was very pleasant, and if we are back in Montreal, we would definitely stay at the same place!",10.0
Mohammed's place was great. It was very clean and the space was huge with high ceilings and lots of big windows which provided amazing natural light throughout the day. The location was amazing and everything was within walking distance. Check-in was a breeze. I would definitely recommend this place to others and I would book again in the future.,10.0
"Large, awesome spot to explore the city. Easy and great communication with the owner.",10.0
"Mohammed was very responsive. The location is wonderful. The apartment is very large with huge windows that open like patio doors. The kitchen needs some attention. Missing drawer front, missing oven door front, not many plates, cups, utensils. Great location. It smelled like smoke - could be an amazing place but all the little things have to be corrected. I have stayed in many Airbnb's and this is the first one I wasn't super pleased with. Mohammed was very responsive - didn't ever meet him in person.",10.0

"We are still talking about how great this condo was for us. The location is unbeatable - a block and a half from the Museum of Fine Arts, three blocks from the Bell Centre and the grocery store, in the middle of shopping, bars, and restaurants galore. We were two couples and the layout was perfect - bedrooms private and separate, queen beds in both, and two bathrooms which is not common in Montreal.  We loved the spacious open concept living area, the comfortable furniture, and preparing meals in the kitchen. Great gathering spot for us to sit and recount our daily exploits. The building is safe and secure, and we were made to feel welcome. Expect light and noise because you are right downtown. It did not bother us as we found the windows really block the sound. All in all, it was the perfect spot for enjoying marvelous Montreal.",10.0

Our stay in this accommodation was perfect! The beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of space.,9.0
"Well-located apartment. It lacked a washing machine and dryer, which forced us to ask friends for help with laundry (6 people including 4 children, this results in a lot of clothes). Neighbors are directly behind the bedroom door at the back. We can hear their discussions and kitchen smells (primarily burnt/garlic/onion) permeate the apartment during every meal. We've arranged to not stay there during these moments. The owner welcomed us warmly and quickly showed us the apartment. There was even a coloring book with crayons ;) There is no reserved parking space, but we were able to find a spot within 50 meters of the stairs. The apartment is located on the upper level of the duplex. The stairs are often icy in winter and salted regularly. We'll be back for sure!",9.0
I loved it and I would definitely rebook it again!,9.0
Very nice place perfect for a small group and right in front of the metro. Netflix is an advantage not to be neglected,9.0

We had a tiny issue with a thermostat and Jade responded quickly and was there to help in minutes and resolved the issue immediately. We were in town for wedding dress shopping and she gave us some really great tips. It is directly across the street from a metro and bus station and cabs are always around. It was also a 5-minute walk from several restaurants and shops on St. Hubert Street, including a grocery store. We loved it and would definitely stay there again!",9.0

Great place and a great location!,9.0
"You could not find a better location in Montréal for super easy metro access and finding everything you need within walking distance. The apartment was spotless, the beds were very comfortable, and we loved the bright but cozy kitchen. Since we were a big group, another comfortable chair or two in the living room would have been nice, but it worked out great for us. It was very easy to find as we arrived at different times. Do note that there are external stairs to reach the second-floor apartment which might be tricky for some with mobility issues.",9.0

Jade is amazing.",9.0

"We loved our stay at Jade's place! It had plenty of room for our family of five. It's right across the street from the Metro station, which was fantastic. There are no laundry facilities, but we didn't need them, so that was fine with us! We had a couple of questions while we were there and she answered almost immediately! The only downside was temporary and not at all Jade's fault. They are doing construction right next door and they start every morning promptly at 7, so if sleeping in is a priority, it might not work out for a little while.  We would definitely stay there again though!",9.0

"The pictures accurately depict the place, with ample room for larger groups. It's an ideal location; everything is close by (metro, IGA, shopping). Cleanliness is top-notch. The piano was a delightful bonus! Jade was incredibly understanding as one of my guests fell ill in the morning before check-out and Jade allowed us to stay until we had to leave for the airport. I would definitely recommend this space to anyone; it's well worth it!",9.0
"Clean apartment that sleeps a number of people. Responsive hosts.

On the negative side, the apartment was not well provisioned for cooking own meals (we had to request utensils to cook with) and using the dishwasher (we had to ask for washing pellets and only one tea towel had been provided - we asked for more of both). 

Access to the first floor apartment is not accurate in the description. Access is via an outside winding staircase and some of the steps are rotten. The flooring just inside the front door may also prove tricky for those who are physically disabled as it is different to the flooring in the rest of the apartment.",9.0

"We stayed in Jade's place for a ladies weekend, and it was fantastic! The place is cozy and clean, and the neighborhood is wonderful. We were able to walk to some amazing restaurants, markets, and shops, and the metro stop was right across the street with only a 30-minute trip downtown. Jade was responsive when we had a question and check-in was easy. We'll definitely be staying here on future trips to Montreal!",9.0
"Jade's place is a gem! The location is great, really close to the Beaubien station. There are lots of nice bars and restaurants in the neighborhood.

"The apartment is well located, close to major avenues heading towards Montreal's points of interest. For those who prefer public transportation or rainy days, the Beaubien metro station (orange line) is directly across from the apartment.  On Saint-Zotique street, a IGA supermarket is open until 11pm: this is a plus for late arrivals as we were able to pick up some breakfast items. The instructions provided were very clear. Jade is very responsive to messages. The apartment offers spacious bedrooms and sufficient kitchen equipment.",9.0

"Beautiful split level apartment unit. Everything was very new and clean. Large, spacious, great shower pressure. Even the second bedroom sofa bed was very comfortable. Excellent location with lots of street parking and steps to the metro station and Atwater market. Loved it. Very responsive and helpful host.",10.0
"The place was brand new. However, because one host had given me a lower price than she should have on a month-long stay, there was no attempt to provide the basic things I wanted as a guest, like salt, pepper, sugar, coffee, tea, a toaster, kettle, cutlery trays, hand soap, shower curtain, bath mat, facecloths, space for my folded clothes (it was all taken up by linens while the top shelves in cupboards, which I am too short to reach, were all empty) and most importantly, NOT ONE HANGER in the entire place. In fact, the other host said that because the first host had misquoted the price, he would accept the mistake but that the place came as is. I spent over $150 on things that had already been provided in many other Airbnb lodgings I've stayed in. Did I take all of it with me when I left? You bet I did, it's my hard-earned money.

In addition, the first host told me they would give me a good review even if the place looked like I'd had a ""hangover party"" when I left, in return for a 5-star review or they would be kicked off Airbnb. Funny, I paid a cleaning fee and left the apartment pretty darn clean as I had washed all the towels and swept the floors (no vacuum) the day before I left. Yes, I asked to extend for another month rather than have to find another one and move but I was willing to pay the higher price rather than go through another move. They had other bookings, two that I saw during the month but I found a much better place for less so I lucked out big time! All in all, the three places at that location run by these two hosts are nicely decorated, good location, but after dealing with these hosts, I won't rent from them again.",10.0
"A truly beautiful Airbnb I've visited so far, nine and well-decorated. The cleanliness of the place is impeccable. The only negative point is the noise from the neighbors upstairs. We had to endure it for a large part of the evening and early morning. 

Communication with hosts was quick and clear. Close to a subway station and street parking easy.",10.0

The shower is on the upper level while the bathtub is on the lower level. We experienced a heat wave during our stay, so the air conditioners were a bonus. I had a rental car and was lucky enough to park it right outside the house in front of Frederick's place. I enjoyed my stay at Frederick's and would recommend it to everyone.",10.0

"Optimal location! There are a ton of restaurants nearby, gas stations, Pharmaprix, Atwater Market, SAQ (wine/beer store) and SuperC, all within a 2 minute walking distance. 

The amenities were superb, although we didn't cook, it is equipped with cookware/dinnerware - you would have to purchase your own condiments which is understandable (sharing these things are not entirely foodsafe). 

Street parking in Montreal is confusing - if you don't read French, ask the locals to decipher the signs, otherwise Fred and his team were quick to respond to our inquiries.

Keyless entry also meant we didn't need to fiddle around with key pick-ups or dropoffs.  Our group thoroughly enjoyed their stay and the convenient location.",10.0

"Great value for a very clean and big space! I traveled with a group of 9 people to Montreal, and we were lucky to find such a great place last minute when our Airbnb reservation was cancelled. Raymond was the co-host of this Airbnb and the person I communicated with. He was extremely helpful and quick with responses whenever I had a question about our stay. The apartment was very clean and tidy, the beds were comfortable, and the location was amazing (we could walk to many restaurants and shops). Just make sure you are following the signs for on-street parking in front of the apartment so you don't get a ticket. Overall, we had a great experience and would go back again!",9.0
"A truly exceptional place to stay in Montreal. The apartment is perfectly located and close to shops. Raymond is a very attentive and caring host. There were no communication issues. The apartment is brand new and spotless, we had nothing to complain about. After having a bad experience with another host in Montreal, this apartment and host was a real surprise and we finally managed to enjoy our stay thanks to Raymond. I would like to thank you once again for your hospitality, for moving to help us, and for all the attention you have shown us. This has been truly appreciated by my whole family and myself. Thank you and good luck! :)",9.0

It was a very affordable and preferable option compared to a hotel due to its location in a really cool neighborhood within walking distance of great restaurants. It was within a 45-minute walk of anywhere we wanted to go/see elsewhere in the city, too. The only real issue we encountered was sharing a bathroom with 14 people, but that was anticipated. Overall, it was a great place.",9.0
Disappointing experience. The apartment needed some repairs and the host was unreachable when there was an issue. I would not recommend,9.0
"We loved our stay in this magnificent ground floor apartment and can't recommend it enough. It's in the best location in Montreal (Plateau/Mile-end)! The bedding and towels were nice and clean, as was the kitchen and bathroom. The home was large and it's stocked with all the necessary amenities, kitchen essentials, laundry detergent for the brand new washer/dryer. They even had a Keurig machine and supplied the pods! And they had hotel-style toiletries (shampoo, soap, lotion…) which was a treat. We really enjoyed the nice comfy sitting area with the large smart TV with access to Netflix. We loved the shops on Chic Laurier and the area restaurants including the famous bagel shop on Fairmount. Parking was super easy as we were able to fit 4 cars comfortably in the back and had access to the back entrance! Communication was amazing, and Raymond was always there if assistance was needed. I will recommend this place to any friends who visit Montreal and hope to visit again in the future!",9.0
"Our weekend stay at this apartment was amazing. It had a great location relative to all of our activities (close enough to walk to downtown, to restaurants, to the clubs, etc.). Very clean and tidy apartment that was roomy enough for 8 guys to sleep in comfortably for the weekend. One bathroom was not an issue for our group, as it was a large bathroom for the apartment. Back and forth communication was very fast and extremely helpful, and Raymond even helped us unlock the apartment when we locked ourselves out one afternoon. Overall, amazing time at a fantastic apartment! Couldn't have picked a better place for our weekend stay.",9.0

"I had a pleasant stay at Raymond's place. It is reasonably priced, the location is great, and Raymond was attentive to our needs. The common space was a bit cramped for our group of 10 but we managed. We were disappointed with some things. First, the bathroom door doesn't close properly (it swings open right after you try to shut it). Second, the WiFi is so slow that it was essentially unusable. Overall, I think the place is definitely worth the stay for its value.",9.0
"As advertised, Raymond was a fantastic host and communicator. He was incredibly responsive and flexible, especially when we wanted to check in early.  The location is good, right in the heart of Plateau with lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. The living room in the apartment is kind of small so not ideal for large groups to hang out.",9.0

"This was my first time renting an Airbnb. We booked another location and the host cancelled on us an hour before we arrived. Within that last hour I was frantically trying to find another place to stay. My boys and I just drove 14 hours to Montreal.

Raymond is a lifesaver! The place was just as described, clean and cozy, with a washer/dryer. Parking was key! Walking distance to nightlife, stores, restaurants, grocery stores, short drive to Old Montreal. 

The most important aspect of this stay was communication!!!!! A++++

Raymond kept in touch frequently to make sure our stay was pleasant!!!

Again, thank you Raymond!",9.0
"The location of the house is great, having off-street parking spot in the back was so helpful, and Raymond was super responsive and flexible. However, the apartment itself did not live up to our expectations. We felt that the Airbnb photos were very misleading. Future renters should know that the apartment is really quite small - for a group of more than 4 or so it would be very cramped. The photos were obviously taken with a wide-angle lens and lots of extra lighting. It's not a brand-new building and it's somewhat worn in some places, and one of the bedrooms has a plastic sliding door that doesn't close all the way, another doesn't have a secondary exit (window/door) for fire escape. There was a pile of garbage by the back door, including a discarded computer, broken furniture, and broken glass. One of our party found a bug and a hair on her mattress, though the house was otherwise clean. The walls to the apartment next door were thin and neighbors were playing music until after midnight.

Essentially, for flexible travelers okay with basic accommodations in a fantastic location, this would be a great place. For those looking for a little more comfort, you should probably look elsewhere.",9.0

The area was perfect and close to shops, restaurants, and bars!",9.0

"Shlo/Joseph's place is a great spot! There are plenty of kitchen appliances, extra bedding and towels, and space for people to sleep! The whole place was very clean and cozy. They were always communicating with me throughout the whole trip.

"Pictures make rooms appear larger than they are. I would not suggest a group of more than 8 people staying here. We arrived to the house to find that the parking spots were completely covered in snow and ice, which we had to shovel ourselves with one plastic shovel. One of our three cars was damaged in the process because of the icy snow. On top of that, we were almost locked out one night because the back door's lock was broken (not our fault) and the front door's lock was extremely loose and then broke because of it. The Wi-Fi was terrible and I noticed several reviews about it; this is upsetting because none of us had service the entire time unless we connected to a nearby cafe. Clearly there has been little maintenance done on this apartment, and clearly nobody ensures that it is in pristine condition before guests from another country stay in it.",9.0

"We're not sure if we actually met the owner of the place, but we met with Michael who was nice and showed us around. The building is nice and revamped, however it seems to be smack in the middle of the biggest hill ever. Don't put your suitcase down if it has wheels lol

Parking costs $20.00 per night, but you do at least get to park underground. 

The place had a very strong smell of chemicals but was clean. Once we started putting our food into the fridge, we realized that the fridge was broken so we contacted Michael and he suggested we could stay in another apartment within the same building. The other place was much nicer and had pretty much everything we needed, except for a first aid kit. There wasn't one in the entire building either. 

The shower pressure was really intense. It was nice but also annoying as it would soak the entire floor even with the shower curtain closed. 

Overall, it was a decent stay!",10.0

Parking and laundries are shared with the unit next door, so availability depends on that. The apartment is noisy due to neighbors, airport traffic, and is located right next to train tracks.

"Sindy's room was shared with her, so we had a double bed in her room, and since there were two of us, it wasn't obvious as we didn't want to disturb anyone, so we didn't talk too loudly. The address wasn't the same as the one on the listing, which caused us some trouble, as well as the parking being free in the listing, but it was actually on the street between 9pm and 9am, so we had to look for a spot outside. We were able to enjoy the pool and sauna, and Sindy had lent us towels, shampoo, and soap. She didn't have any lunch either, except for a box of cereal that was on the fridge, but we left before 9am because of the parking, so we couldn't stay long. For the price and privacy, I will choose a hotel next time in Montreal.",8.0

The hosts were in touch throughout our stay and very flexible and accommodating about check-in and check-out times. I would definitely come back again!",9.0
"Steph and Camilla offer amazing communication and a great, clean, comfortable place to stay",9.0

Great communication and very accommodating. The location is very ideal. My boyfriend and I had a great time.,9.0
This place is in a fantastic location! Close to public transportation and within walking distance of downtown and Mount Royal. It was the perfect size apartment. Everything was clean and ready for us. I would definitely want to stay here again next time.,9.0
"Zentru (Hidden by Airbnb) is located in Lage, with a nice and clean setup.  It's just a bit rundown in terms of construction. Communication with Steph and Camilla was seamless and friendly. Parking spaces and parking garages are easily found nearby.",9.0
"Steph & Camilla's place was a true gem. It had a really convenient location for travelers like myself who want to be close to the bustling city center yet have quiet and peaceful nights. The stylish studio apartment had all the amenities you could ever need, and Steph very generously lent me the laundry card for the washing machines which are located in the basement. It was a very pleasant stay and I would recommend this place to solo travelers/couples!",9.0
"We spent two nights in Steph & Camilla's apartment in Montreal. It is conveniently located and close to everything. We arrived by train earlier than check-in time, however, S&C were most accommodating and the apartment was ready for us when we got there, which we really appreciated as dragging bags around is no fun. The space was great. Cosy and comfortable with basic supplies plus a coffee machine! We found some olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which we mixed together in a little bowl to dip some crunchy bread, and had with olives and a glass of wine on the sunny balcony... pure joy after being on the road for several weeks... Thank you both for a great stay... we would definitely recommend this place.",9.0
"Steph & Camilla's place has a perfect location close to transit, Mont Royal, and Old Montreal. A grocery store is located two minutes away by foot, making it very convenient.

The place was as expected clean and comfortable with all the basic kitchen supplies plus a coffee maker. 

Steph and Camilla were an excellent host. They had great communication, were accommodating with check-in time, and always kept in touch before and during my stay to check if I had any questions and if everything was okay. 

If I have to come back to Montreal, I will definitely stay here again.",9.0
"If you want to know all about the center of Montreal, stay at Steph & Camilla's. A very good location. THANK YOU!!!",9.0
"Great location for exploring the city. Less than five minutes walk to the metro station. The building has a bit of an unfinished look, but the interior of the apartment is nicer. No AC - this is standard in Montreal, but summer nights can be uncomfortable. Overall a good stay.",9.0

Had a great time! Good location. Apartment matched the description.,9.0
"Unshat is bei Steph and Camilla very much liked, even if we unfortunately couldn't meet them personally. Everything was very clean. Equipment for cooking was all there. Wifi was excellent. 

At the beginning of the street are rental bikes, bus stop 2 minutes around the corner, directly next to the supermarket. The metro is also easily reachable on foot (4-5 minutes).

The elevator is a bit old, but that has nothing to do with the cool apartment. :)
We would definitely come back again.

"Steph & Camilla's place is in a great, walkable area of Montreal. The apartment is clean and cozy. Communication was excellent - Steph always replied to my messages and questions right away...and even assisted me in finding a free parking space just outside the apartment building when I arrived. I would definitely recommend this place if you're wanting to stay in Montreal for a few nights!",9.0
Clean and well-located to discover Montreal. Very convenient for walking to any place and close to the subway as well. Steph was always available when seeking places or suggestions.,9.0
"Steph & Camilla's place was quaint and accommodating for what we were looking for. The price was right and the location was perfect. We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go. The hosts were very good about contacting us to make sure we were able to check in smoothly. The only drawback was that we visited during a heat wave and the place, like many in Montreal, did not have air conditioning. The building itself was also older and in need of a little maintenance. Overall we enjoyed our stay! Thank you!",9.0
"Well lit, very clean, adorable apartment. It is simply the PERFECT location. Walkable to Mont-Royal (for hiking, park-sitting/picnics, tam-tams on Sundays), the ""city-like"" feel of St. Catherine and St Laurent (lots of cool places to see, shopping, and nightlife!). I love walking and even walked to Old Port (Ferris wheel, ziplining, ropes course, and lots of shopping and sightseeing) from the room! I felt very safe in the room! The balcony was a lovely aspect of the apartment.",9.0
"Close to central Montreal, great for walking places, particularly up Mont Royal. Apartment was as described.",9.0
Great location.,9.0
"Our stay at Steph and Camilla's was perfect. The space is cute and quiet. Although it's located in a big apartment building, we never heard any of our neighbors. My friend slept on the sofa bed and found it very comfortable! We had great weather during our trip so we walked everywhere - mile end, Old Montreal, Plateau Mont Royal were all easily accessible by foot. Alex was also in touch with us to check in and responded immediately to our questions. I would recommend staying at Steph and Camilla's to anyone visiting Montreal.",9.0
"Steph and Alex were incredibly accommodating. They greeted me and offered to help me with my luggage down the stairs upon check out (due to a small issue with the elevator). Also, I was traveling alone and felt very safe in this area and in this apartment.

The location is walkable to most popular spots and the rest of the sites are easily bikeable. 

I really enjoyed my visit and this place was perfect for my quick trip. I would be happy to stay here again.",9.0
Really adorable place in a great location. We had a great time!,9.0
"Nice place, very homey. Good location, right near McGill. Parking is tricky in this busy neighborhood. The apartment was as described. Quite nice but slightly worn at the heels.

"We had a great time in Montreal. Steph and Camilla's apartment was well equipped and clean. The location in the city center was ideal for exploring the city. Rental bikes were right outside the house, and a supermarket was around the corner. Only the house is a bit old. Finding a parking space was a bit difficult because all free spaces were occupied, but a multi-storey car park was close to the apartment, as Steph and Camilla told us. 

Steph and Camilla were very helpful and it was easy to communicate with them.",9.0
"A cute and stylish place for the money, and in a great location. There were a few infrastructure problems during my stay, but Steph & Camilla were very nice and responsive about it. The bathroom and the building itself could use some upgrades. Overall a good value and nice stay. Thanks!",9.0

"It was a nice apartment, slightly smaller than pictured and the overall building was somewhat sketchy and problematic. The hosts answered all questions promptly.",9.0
"We had such a great stay! The apartment was just as expected. Friendly neighbors too, which is always a plus. Amazing location. We drove from NYC and the parking was easily accessible, not expensive (about $17 for 24 hours) and right around the corner — thank you so much to the hosts for sending a detailed map of how to find the garage!!! AMAZING location of the apartment too. Definitely go to Pullman's right around the corner if you stay here!!!",9.0
"Honestly, if you haven't booked this place already, do it now!!! Wow! We were blown away by the hospitality and cleanliness of their place. They were accommodating with our check-in and out times to work with our flights. The apartment was easily accessible AND spotless. I mean seriously spotless. Not a single hair and speck on the floor. No dust. It was the cleanest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. The location was perfect. Montreal is a super friendly and walkable city. I was communicated with within minutes every time I messaged. The bed is comfortable and the living room welcoming. The balcony was a great touch to enjoy coffee in the morning. It's also super simple to get up to. It’s the 8th floor and there is an elevator for your bags! Walking distance of a mile or so to pretty much everything you have to see. I’m already planning my trip back in the spring! Thank you again!!!!!!",9.0

"Mario's loft was the perfect home-away-from-home for my first time in Montreal. It was well-kept, clean, and inviting with beautiful windows and thoughtful finishing touches throughout the space. Mario and his wife thought of everything and were always speedy to respond during my stay.

A few highlights: great neighborhood with everything you could need within walking distance, quiet neighbors, fast wifi, jacuzzi tub with rainfall shower, stylish and modern, plush linens, fully equipped kitchen 

Would definitely come back again!",9.0
"The place was beautiful, the neighbors were nice. The host came and gave us a quick visit. Only minor issues; the toilet chain keeps falling. Overall great experience.",9.0
"Incredible and very spacious loft, it was awesome! Nothing to say",9.0
"Great loft, lots of space and conveniently located near where I needed to be. There are some decent bars/restaurants nearby within walking distance. The only downside was that the TV had an antenna, so there weren't many channels.",9.0
"The accommodation is superb. It's spacious and very well equipped, everything is clean and Mario is a friendly and understanding host.",9.0
"Mario's place is amazing. Very nicely decorated, not too much. Everything is super clean, which is the most important thing for me, but the place is fully equipped for everything that you need. They don't have a laundry room but I didn't need that. Super great location, close to the metro (even though I drove there), close to good restaurants and bars. 

I had an amazing experience and would recommend Mario's place.",9.0
"I had the pleasure of staying here for 12 nights straight. The loft is incredible and beautifully styled. You're literally one minute away from everything you need, so the location could not be better. The loft is very spacious and looks even better in person! I would highly recommend booking this place for your stay. Communication with Mario was awesome and he was a fantastic host. I look forward to staying here again in the future! Thanks, Mario!",9.0

"Very stylish place. Lots of space. Comfortable bed. Kitchen is a bit understocked for cooking, but there are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby that may not be an issue.",9.0
Great place,9.0
"As native Montrealers, we appreciated that the loft had touches that were “very Montreal”; the outside of the building is more industrial, so it’s a fun surprise to walk into the impeccably designed loft. The space was previously a dance studio and we liked that they left the old mambo logo on the door and windows. 

The space is airy and vast. It feels great to be in, has big windows and lots of light. Parking was a breeze, the kitchen was well-equipped, the bathroom modern and clean, and the upstairs bedroom in the loft was cozy. You’re walking distance to some of Montreal’s best (St Viateur Bagels, Cafe Olympico, and tons of decent local bars). We came as a family and loved it. I think it works well for both families and people looking to go out and party. Mario was very helpful and getting the keys was easy too.",9.0
"Wow, what a spot! This is an immaculate studio apartment in the Mile End area within walking distance to all its streets right out the door. I enjoyed the high-tech TV that allowed me to screen cast my phone (it also has Chromecast, but no actual television programming). The bed was wonderfully comfortable. I was only there for one night, and Tony arranged for someone to meet me to deliver the keys, who was hospitable. 

Parking is in a gravel parking lot, and when parked in front of the kindergarten, I felt like it was a safer spot. In the morning there are many people who use the lot, so you're not the only one. 

The kitchen is stocked with only the essentials, which was all I needed. My only wish is that their jet-bathtub in the bathroom was fully functional. Otherwise this is an excellent and very comfortable location.",9.0
"Great stay, the place was clean and tidy. Close to shops, restaurants, and bars. The host was easy to communicate with. Would definitely book again!",9.0
"Mario has a great place. It's well-done and located in a great area of town with lots of restaurants and places to go out. The only negative is noise at night due to the location on a busy road, but otherwise it's all great. And Mario is very communicative!",9.0
"The location and the facility were absolutely amazing! Practically located, parking right next door, quiet for a very busy part of town, I can say nothing wrong about the place. And the host was impeccable!",9.0
The place is okay. It feels public. Not personal. Good location. Could be better furnished and decorated for this price.,9.0
"First trip to Montreal, amazing place to stay close to everything and a very fun neighborhood. A place you won't forget.",9.0
"Mario's loft is beautiful in person, with a great location, ample space, plenty of natural light. The loft was incredibly clean and all the amenities I needed were readily available. I would definitely stay again on my next trip to Montreal.",9.0
"I absolutely fell in love again with Montreal, with an old friend, and with Mario's place. I was so sad to leave!  There really weren't any complaints--beautiful wooden floors and floor-to-ceiling windows—great location in Mile End. It's a good 20-minute walk to Old Montreal, but I've been there done that, and if you want to go it's a $10 cab ride. Mario's place was perfect! The bed was super comfy, the shower and tub were huge, the lighting in the place was gorgeous. Big kitchen, huge living room and TV area. OH! And I loved the floor-length mirror off of the living room, which is fun to use for whatever self-reflective purposes you find helpful. :)",9.0
It would be nice to have more than just a giant comforter for the bed; it's hot and we just need a sheet.,9.0
"Amazing apartment with plenty of space for a group of people. Everything was clean and in order. Additionally, the location is very close to almost everything you would need.",9.0
"The apartment is spacious, clean, and the location is perfect!
We booked at the last minute and I am satisfied with the place. 
It lacks a few kitchen utensils (1 butter knife) and the kitchen sink was blocked.  Mario is available and easy to reach, and he tried to fix the sink, but unfortunately he couldn't fix it before our departure. 
He accepted that we were leaving at 2 pm and this without any extra charge, which is very appreciated.
Overall a good choice!",9.0
"Wow, where do I even begin? The place, the neighborhood, the care, the space, the tastes, the quick response, the coffee shops around, the smile when I wake up and go to sleep in this apartment - I definitely will come back, I definitely give 5 stars, and 5 more stars!!!! Wow!",9.0
Sinks do not work outside of that they are pretty easy to get along with!,9.0
"Good overall, but the kitchen sink was broken.",9.0
"Huge space, good location, great stay",9.0
"I see there was another review about the kitchen sink being broken. Wish I had seen that before I booked... I was advised when I arrived that the sink wasn't working. There is a bucket under the sink which leaked all over the floor on my first day. The host told me there was nothing he could do about this and asked me to clean it myself.  I then tried to use the dishwasher to clean my dishes. It leaked a pool of water all over the floor. When I messaged the host for help, they brought me a mop and were angry that I used the dishwasher, stating that I was ruining someone's boutique below their place. I cleaned the mess myself and had to do dishes in the bathtub for the rest of my weekend. The fridge also doesn't close all the way so I had to briefly transfer things to the freezer to keep them cold and the TV was locked on someone else's Chromecast for the entire stay. Definitely a non-functional Airbnb until they repair the above issues and the host was rude/unhelpful with all of the things that weren't working.",9.0
The host cancelled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0
"Mario's loft is breathtaking, I felt like a celebrity. It is gigantic with great furniture, lighting, and aesthetics. I’ve never stayed anywhere nicer. The place was twice as big as I expected, and we spent about an hour after we got in talking about how lucky we were to have booked this place. The windows and ceiling are gigantic. The place is fairly centrally located close to all of the hip restaurants and bars in the Mile End area, which is one of the coolest areas of Montreal. Mario was super accommodating and helpful. I arrived late at night and he was able to make arrangements for the keys.",9.0
"Excellent stay with Noemi and her adorable pets (Dexter, Xena, and Finn). Very family-like atmosphere, makes you feel right at home! Noemi is always willing to help, giving suggestions for the most popular or crowded places in Montreal. Excellent location, just a few steps from the metro (5 minutes), and with many shops around where it's located. I highly recommend this place, the company and the atmosphere! So don't hesitate to book here :)",9.0

Walkable to many local shops in Montreal. The bed is super comfortable and the hosts are very welcoming.,9.0
"Veronique's Place was great for me and my friend who I went to Montreal with. Her roommates were two guys, very helpful and friendly. We were out and about most of the time and we had a car to get around but the apartment is close to a bus stop if you need to use it. The only thing that wasn't advertised was that there is smoking in the apartment - as long as that doesn't bug you, great place! Also not far from downtown and close to bars and shops in the neighborhood.",9.0
"The small room is charming and the bed is comfortable. However, the apartment is messy and may smell bad; there are no curtains at the window and everything that happens in the living room can be heard. The host is kind and the apartment has a lot of potential, with some regular cleaning it would be really good, according to me.",9.0
"The room was nice. The bed was comfy. The host was friendly but wasn't there when we checked in. There were no working sinks when we were there, but we didn't spend much time at the Airbnb anyway. I don't think that information was pre-warned about though. Very friendly little three-legged kitty. Very convenient location if you want to go to La Ronde for the day. Overall, not a bad time, but definitely a few hiccups.",9.0

"Basic but spotless and comfortable apartment in a trendy neighborhood with plenty of free street parking.

"Julie was an amazing host. I stayed almost 3 weeks in her apartment (2nd floor), and would definitely return next time I am in Montreal and needing a place to stay. You could tell the place had been thoroughly cleaned before we arrived (my husband, my baby, and I). The place had everything we asked for for the baby, and had all necessary amenities. She even got us a small appliance when we asked for it, and shared her kids toys with us for the baby to play with! She made sure we had enough soap and toilet paper. She was very welcoming, friendly, and kind. I had a really great experience. Thank you Julie and see you next time!",10.0
"Julie's hospitality and natural charm are unrivaled, the space was everything you could ask for as well as being ridiculously clean and more spacious than the pictures show! Julie also offered many helpful tips on where to go and what to see as well as answering any questions we had in a prompt and timely manner. I'd highly recommend this spot, you will not regret it!

"Carolina was very accommodating, friendly, and helpful. There was a mistake with the keys and she kindly brought the right set of keys when we asked even though it wasn't an essential need. She gave us helpful parking tips as well. The location was excellent, there were two metro stations very close and many restaurants and shops. 

There were a few issues with the amenities of the place. There wasn't enough toilet paper there so we had to buy our own. There weren't dish towels or paper towels which should be considered part of kitchen amenities. There is a few kitchen supplies but don't expect to cook a full meal there. The biggest issue was that the window in the bedroom wouldn't close all the way and there was a small crack that let in all the cold air. 

Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we had a lovely time in Montreal.",9.0

"The few pictures on the web page do not do the apartment justice. The place is much larger than I expected from the pictures, like a big one-bedroom apartment. The location is fantastic; there's a Bixi bike share right by the entrance, a metro station across the street, and Old Montreal within walking distance.",9.0
We had a great time and would stay again if we were back in Montreal. I would highly recommend this place.,9.0
Great host. Stephan will answer your needs immediately. Great location. Close to downtown Montreal's hub and old port.,9.0

"Honestly, this is a tough review to write. 

**Pros:**
1) The location was 11/10. 
2) The host was pretty responsive in terms of speed. 
3) Checking in was easy enough. 
4) The bathroom was fine and the shower/water pressure was great. 
5) Wi-Fi was fast and reliable.

**Cons:**
1) Carpeted areas of the apartment were soaked due to a flood (the host knew about this and didn't warn us during our pre-check in communications on the day of arrival), the carpet was black and moldy looking (and in some areas, he had covered it with another rug which also soaked through). 
2) The apartment smelled increasingly damp/moldy/musty over the 2.5 days we were there. It caused my roommate to sneeze throughout the night.
3) Communications with the host regarding the flooding situation became oddly defensive. I ended up having to placate him as he got very angry when I told him that the situation did not meet our expectations for the stay and to please look into the matter immediately (day 2/3).
4) Building entrance doors weren't ever locked. Anyone could walk in off the street - not sure if that's the norm in Montreal for rental/primarily AirBNB buildings, but as two women staying by ourselves, it made us uncomfortable. Not really the host's fault of course, but we should have been informed.
5) When he let himself and/or the building maintenance crew into the apartment to investigate (while we were out for the day), we returned several hours later to find that they had left the apartment unlocked. All our stuff was in the apartment, including my roommate's passport, laptop, jewelry, etc. This combined with the fact that the building has zero security at the entrance made us very uncomfortable and we felt it was very inappropriate that the host did not ensure that he locked the apartment door upon his leaving. It was sheer luck that no one thought to try to walk in and help themselves to anything.",9.0
Stéphane was extremely responsive and communicative.,9.0
The host was excellent at communication and responded very quickly. The apartment is located in a prime location and is very well maintained. I would definitely use them again.,9.0
"I loved this location! So close to everything, a safe neighborhood, lots of dining options. Very walkable areas. The place was clean and convenient. Stephane was very accommodating as we had an arrival after midnight. I would stay here again if I return to this beautiful and vibrant city.",9.0
"This was a perfect place and location for us during our few days in Montreal. While there were only two of us, it would have been very suitable for a small family. The location was perfect. Not right in the center of old town to be overwhelming but just a couple blocks away to be very convenient. It's right around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica and about a block from the Metro. We used all public transportation during our stay and it was very easy to navigate the subway/bus lines. The apt has everything you need for cooking, TV works fine with several cable channels and WiFi was good. Our host was communicative and was accommodating with a request we made and we were thankful for that. Highly recommend Tommy cafe up the street for coffee and breakfast. They have a nice breakfast sandwich and avocado toast with egg and really nicely made coffee!",9.0
"Great location, perfect place for a Montreal getaway. Stéphane was very helpful.",9.0
Pretty good!,9.0
"What a spot!! After a simple miscommunication at check-in my girlfriend and I were inside the best value apartment space in Old Montreal! Everything was clean, accessible, and secure inside the building. Parking was easy enough. And... you cannot beat the location. Walking distance to Old Montreal, the Old Port, St Catherine's and Crescent St restaurants downtown! Highly recommend.",9.0

"This condo is in a fantastic location, close to the metro and all of Old Montreal! It's a very safe and secure location. I will definitely return and recommend it to my friends and family.",9.0
Great apartment. Excellent location.,9.0
"This location is the perfect central point within a radius that's centrally located to almost everything (even local transit). The apartment is well-furnished and very private. 

Communication from the host was spectacular and questions were answered almost instantly. 

I highly recommend this spot for trips to Old Montreal.  

Also, parking costs extra. However, the location gives you peace of mind since it's connected below the building and not remotely.",9.0
"Great experience. The apartment is in an excellent location, close to downtown, St. Laurent, Chinatown, Old Port and very close to the metro so easy to get around the city. The apartment itself was very clean and accurately represented by the photos. Check-in/check-out was easy and the place had everything we needed. We would definitely stay again.",9.0
"Stephane's place is in a fantastic location. It's about a 5-minute walk to Notre Dame Basilica and the metro is right across the street. Communication was great, and Stephane responded immediately to our inquiries. The place is perfect for a couple or maybe three people at most. Thanks for hosting us, Stephane.",9.0
Spacious apartment located in a highly convenient area. It's within easy walking distance of Notre Dame Cathedral and numerous excellent restaurants in Old Montreal.,9.0
Wonderful place to stay with a great location. Stephanie was very helpful,9.0
"Nice place, great location, very secure. The TV volume is low so you can't hear it when the heating is on or the shower, but everything else was good.  It's a good deal for the price.",9.0
"The apartment was comfortable and located in a very central position, which made it very convenient for my short stay. I would recommend this place to anyone.",9.0
"The apartment itself was comfortable, and the heating worked well. There is a tiny television, but you shouldn't be watching TV anyway, right? For those who will use the indoor parking, it would be wise to park at the end of the 15-minute parking for the Embassy Suites because you will have to go up to the apartment to get the parking pass and drive around one-way streets to reach the parking garage. If you park in the 15-minute zone, you can probably just back up 10 feet to get to the garage. There is an entrance to the indoor connected Montreal across the street, and you can walk all the way to Eaton Centre in about 25 minutes or Place des Arts in about 15 minutes. Just be sure to map it out beforehand.",9.0

Awesome place in front of Palais des Congrès. Very clean place.,9.0
"The apartment was clean and located in a fantastic spot. Old Montreal is a bit touristy, but it's also easy to reach other parts of Montreal from the location. Stephane was very responsive and helpful.",9.0
Great place and host!,9.0
Communication has always been very easy. The host is always there to answer our questions. The accommodation is very well located and soundproofed. I recommend it.,9.0
"The places have what you need for a short trip. It is near the subway, so it is well-located. 

We really like it. A nice place.",9.0
"I suggest taking photos of the entire accommodation before you leave because in my case, the host charged me for a lamp I never saw and that wasn't mentioned in the listing. Please be careful to avoid misunderstandings that could lead to financial repercussions.",9.0
"The place is in the BEST location for Old Montreal! Just steps away from so many great places. The host is also awesome, ensuring you have tons of information before your arrival! Super quick responses and great communication! I can't wait to come back in the summer!!",9.0
"This condo is perfectly located between the old town, the harbor and downtown. Very clean, easy to access. I really enjoyed my stay in Montreal :)",9.0
"Great location, central to everything. Overall, the unit is clean and fairly spacious. The bed feels like it has been used a lot and is hard. The ""second bed""/Futon feels like it's about to break at any moment. I only sat on the second bed, but overall, it was a great location and a decent unit. I would definitely stay here again for a quick weekend trip.",9.0
"Many thanks to Constantin for hosting us.

The place is beautiful and very centrally located at the Plateau. 

They had all the baby stuff that we needed and even more, which was amazing.

Communication was great before and during our visit despite the fact that they were out of town.

Many thanks!",10.0
"I rented this place for my family who came from Russia for my cousin's wedding. We had 13 of us stay here and it was undeniably the best experience. I live in Montreal and have been to many places and this place by far was the most unbelievably gorgeous. So well designed. The location of the penthouse is steps away from everything in old port Montreal, from stores to restaurants, clubs and bars. We had an incredible waterfront view of the old port as well. If I could give this place a 10 star rating I would! Thank you from my family, my cousin and me!!!",10.0
"Penthouse was awesome!  Stayed over with a couple of friends. Location was right on Pier Central, so close to everything. The place is huge, well-designed, and stylish. The host even took me around for a night! I'd definitely stay here again.",10.0
"This place was beautiful, exquisite, and it's in a perfect location. I don't think I could have picked a better place to stay during my time in Montreal. I stayed here for my brother's bachelor party and it exceeded all of my expectations with a group of 16. Our host was incredibly gracious and accommodating for all of our needs. He was also more than helpful to give recommendations and even accompanied us to get all the necessities we would need during our stay. He even came out with us on our first night and made us feel right at home. This place and the host really made my brother's bachelor party an incredible one, and I don't think I'll ever forget that.",10.0
The place is amazing and the service was great! Jonathan and Raj were very responsive and helped out with their local knowledge around the city as well!,10.0

"This place is awesome, I was in Montreal for a company Christmas party with my colleagues and we had this place. Amazing hospitality and the owner ensured we had fun and his recommendations for Montreal were perfect",10.0
"Two separate units with ample space for 13 people to sleep.  The two apartments offer unique/interesting décor. The location is ideal for exploring Old Montreal, and the hosts provided helpful suggestions for places to dine out.",10.0
A welcome surprise when we walked into the apartment. It felt better than the photos. Located in a very historic and walkable area. Lots of buzz & shops. Milo was an incredible host and made sure we were happy at every turn. We had to switch apartments due to a plumbing accident. Milo walked us through every step to upgrade us to another place which we equally loved. Great hospitality.,8.0
The host cancelled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,8.0
"Milo had excellent communication; his place was very nice. The only problem was that when we arrived, the guest ahead of us broke the shower. He gave us a very small partial refund, but we were forced to shower in a public area. The shower had no water pressure and mold everywhere. Although this might not have been his fault, we thought the issue should have been resolved during our stay since we complied with everything he needed and provided him with all the information about the shower promptly.",8.0
"The shower in the unit before entering the unit. The host (Milo) notified me prior to my arrival that it would be fixed by the next day. He instructed me to bathe myself with hot water. The next day he brought two buckets to bathe with and messaged me to state that the plumber had ordered the part and it should arrive within the next few days, and the shower should be fixed by the weekend (I had booked a 2-week stay, and for one week I would be without a shower). I was not okay with this arrangement and requested a different possible solution. He then directed me to go to the roof, access the swimming pool, take a shower there, and then come back to the unit. I informed the host that this was not okay to which he replied ""well there is working bath and hot water so what's the issue?"".  I politely requested to be relocated if he had another unit or simply a refund of my money so I could find another unit. Milo did not agree that this was a good idea and took it upon himself to threaten me that his ad never stated that he had a shower, and if I left the unit, I would cancel my stay and there wouldn't be a refund. Long story short after many hours of attempting to politely reason with Milo, I finally contacted Airbnb support and requested their assistance. They also agreed that this was not a good condition for anyone to remain in (no shower and bathing with buckets) and assisted in obtaining my full refund. The host was NOT a nice person nor was he polite or understanding or even cared about the request or the well-being of the guest or the condition which he was leaving me in by asking me to bathe with buckets. He did not care about having misinformed his guest and only wanted the money from the booking. I've booked with many individuals using Airbnb, however, never experienced anything of this caliber. Good luck to you all who book with him",8.0

"Book this apartment!!!!

We loved this beautiful home for many reasons - location: it is steps away from the basilica, great restaurants and all the old town action. Downtown Montreal is very close, so it is easy to walk everywhere. The house was very clean, the bed was roomy and comfortable, the shower and large soaking tub were great and Milo is the best host ever!!! He even sent me an encouraging email when he found out about my illness. Above and beyond!!! Thanks, Milo, for the coffee assortment and the tea. We had an awesome time, stay here!!!",8.0
"My stay with Anne-Laure went well. The spacious apartment with a nice garden was in a good location, but the cleaning wasn't done upon arrival and the neighbor above was very noisy. It's a shame we didn't get to meet the host, although we appreciated the service of a family member.",8.0
The location is quite central. It is very accessible by public transport and located right next to Chinatown.,9.0
"Julia's place at Philly's was amazing. We were so grateful that they let us check in with one hour's notice as our other Airbnb was such a mess, they were lovely and helped us so much. We are so grateful they really saved our trip. We would book this place over and over again!",9.0
"Great apartment, clean and well-furnished with everything you need. Great location too!",9.0
"Great location. Close to Old Montreal, Chinatown, and the metro. The condo was clean, spacious, and had all the amenities you'd need. Julia & Philly were wonderful hosts.",9.0
A beautifully decorated space perfect for a nice getaway from the stress of our New York lives. I highly recommend this location to all who visit the wonderfully friendly Montreal!,9.0
"It was our first time visiting Montreal & we are so glad we stayed in this place! Very close to the old town, metro, grocery store & restaurants, it's also right next to Chinatown. The place itself was spacious, clean & had everything we needed! It even had a gym! Thank you so much for hosting us!",9.0
Very accommodating! The origins parking spot is too short for my minivan and they assigned me immediately to another larger parking spot! I need a second set of keys for convenience and they provided them to me as well and waived the deposit charge! I will definitely be coming back again!!!,9.0
Clean apartment with nice features! Also very convenient location right near Chinatown and the convention center downtown.,9.0
"Fantastic hospitality and great communication! This was our first time booking an Airbnb, so I did have several questions and Julia was very quick to respond and put our minds at ease. The location was fantastic as we had friends staying at a nearby hotel (except they paid triple for their stay). Julia and Philly's place was clean and spacious (comfortably slept 4 adults). Would recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in downtown Montreal. Thank you Julia and Philly!",9.0
"We had a great time! The apartment was beautiful and super clean, but most importantly it had a fantastic location!! Julie was super helpful and made the check-in and check-out process very simple! Would definitely recommend this place! :)",9.0
"The location is great. The apartment is clean and the layout is good. However, there is a plumbing issue in the kitchen sink. Dirty water gets stuck in the sink and causes the entire apartment to smell bad. The offensive lingering odor made us feel uncomfortable all night. If this issue is fixed, then it could be a good place to stay.",9.0
"I was in Montreal for a trade show, and the location couldn't have been more convenient (across from the Palais de Congress). Checking in was a breeze, even though our flight was delayed 3 hours and we arrived late; the communication lines remained open.

The area had great restaurants with walkable locations, centrally located for either driving or walking. The surroundings were secure and clean.

The hosts were responsive and accommodating.",9.0
Thanks Julia for being a great host. Perfect condo in a perfect spot! Everything is just in walkable distance.,9.0

"Great apartment, walking distance from Old Town Montreal and right by the train station! Great communication!",9.0
"Our hosts were very welcoming, the place was very clean and quiet. There is nothing negative to say.",9.0
"Overall this place was great, and the hosts were quick to respond to all the requests. The location was excellent, we were about a 5-minute walk to Notre Dame Basilica. The building was clean and quiet. We had access to the gym which we used. The parking space was a bit small and uncomfortable, but we were glad to have it. The only almost catastrophic thing that happened was when we got there two beds were missing which were advertised in the original post. We contacted Julia and Philly right away, and they said they could drop one off the following day and that the two sofa beds could fit two people each, so we should have enough room. That would have been horrible and uncomfortable for all of us considering we had a 6+ foot tall guy who barely fit by himself on the sofa bed, and couldn't share the queen-size bed in the bedroom. In the end, it all worked out because one of our coworkers didn't come.",9.0
Great place to be if you want to stay downtown. The bedroom is bigger than it looks in the pictures.,9.0
"Super location beautiful complex with heated rooftop pool, Julia really kind and willing to accommodate you thank you so much",9.0

"Unfortunately, Airbnb gave us the incorrect address. We also specifically chose this Airbnb for parking, but the listing did not mention the low ceiling and that large SUVs would not fit. We had to pay to park elsewhere, and when we tried to find the address, we waited about 40 minutes before resolving the actual address with Julia. Julia was extremely attentive to our needs and came as soon as she could to guide us to the correct address matching the listing photo. Also, this property was in an ideal location to explore Old Montreal.",9.0
"Great place, great value!",9.0
"Don't stay here, unsafe, unclean and classic bait and switch. They'll offer you a larger unit, for a price.",9.0
Excellent location and immaculate cleanliness,9.0
"The hosts were accommodating, which was much appreciated. The location was excellent, very close to the old port. I had booked it for my parents (seniors) and the location was perfect for them to get to everywhere they needed to go.",9.0
"This was only our 2nd Airbnb experience and we loved the location for our family of 4 to tour both Old Montreal and downtown by foot or transit.

The condo was clean, had available parking, adequate space for a family of 4, a nice view, was walking distance to a grocery store, and we felt totally safe walking in this area at all times of the day as well. 

If we ever came back to Montreal we would look to stay here again.",9.0
"The location of the condo was perfect!!  Finding the condo itself was difficult, especially parking. Thankfully Julia was quick to respond and gave us further directions. The space itself appeared to be quite different from the pictures, although it was still nice. The space was unclean in the bathroom (toilet and sink) and kitchen (lipstick found on glasses). As for the sleeping arrangements, the space comfortably fit 4 adults. However, the beds were terribly uncomfortable.",9.0
"The space is awesome for a one-bedroom, but cannot comfortably fit six adults. It was a good experience for the short stay we had since we didn't spend a lot of time inside the apartment. The location is awesome, right in the heart of Old Port and close to the metro. The location was a bit confusing at first because the listing said one place but our final confirmation listed another. 

For 888 Rue Saint-François-Xavier, there is no access code to the building, it is free to enter, any floor. 

There are three levels of parking which is good and an adequate gym. 

Julia was great with communication, she also brought us more pillows and towels when requested.",9.0
"Perfect location! Right in Old Montreal, just steps away from great restaurants and attractions. The accommodations were very nice and even included a washer/dryer. Parking was included, which was important for us. Would not hesitate to stay here again.",9.0
"Stylish place right in Old Montreal! It's listed as sleeping six people, but the two fold-out couches we found were only the size of a twin bed.  It might be a bit tight to actually sleep two people on each couch. Other than that, great place!",9.0
"The location was amazing. Parking was a little cumbersome and stressful (we had to go upstairs to get the parking pass before parking and same process to leave, fitting our large car very stressful!). The host did not respond to any of my messages during the stay. Beds were super hard and uncomfortable. The location was perfect for exploring.",9.0
"Great place. Cannot beat the area. Julia and Philly offered quick communication, easy accessibility and answered all my questions. We had everything provided. The place seemed a little smaller than the photos showed, but it was still more than comfortable and roomy. And the location - amazing!!!",9.0
"Excellent host, great location, amazing home",9.0
"The apartment we had was not the one we reserved. On the website at booking, it shows a different apartment that should be in the same building. 

The apartment we got was very disappointing and on top of that, we felt like we were scammed.",9.0
"Julia's apartment location was fantastic for exploring Montreal. It was a bit tricky leaving the car to go up to the 19th floor to get the parking pass before parking. Also, having to do the same in reverse once leaving the underground parking. We were a group of four. The main bedroom was comfortable but the two sofa beds in the lounge were only just adequate for two adults. If we had been a group of six, the sleeping arrangements wouldn't have worked.",9.0
Good for a single couple...,9.0
"Great location! In the heart of old Montreal near all the major hotels. Minutes away from Saint Catherine Street, Chinatown, CoucheTard, and the Place D'Arms metro station. Great garage parking facility, tight turns for big cars/SUVs but all navigable. As with most of Montreal, a lot of one-way streets and the busy street can make your drive there a bit more fun (timely). 

The photos shown in the listing are NOT the same unit. The furniture, finishes, and decorations are similar, but the physical room is not the one as shown. Not a huge issue as the actual unit was quite spacious and the layout didn't impose. Just to note, the listing indicates for 6 guests. At most it could comfortably sleep 4 adults. Two in the queen bed and 1 in each of the two sofa beds. So just beware of that if you have a larger group. Also the sofa beds were quite firm/hard, like sleeping on a camping foam mattress.",9.0
The worst communication with the apartment owner. The apartment does not correspond to the pictures at all.,9.0
Very nice apartment in bustling Chinatown. Host was very prompt with responses. My only issue was that I believe the photos depict multiple apartments and are misleading. It is far too small for six people as advertised and realistically would be awkward for more than one couple. It would be a great place for a couple perhaps with children.,9.0
"Very well-located housing in a hotel residence. No contact with the managers. Everything is done through (website hidden by Airbnb) and efficient, but a bit cold at the end.",9.0
"This studio apartment is well-furnished with plenty of natural light. The space is generous with a small living room for relaxing. The location is excellent for walking everywhere, and we really benefited from the free parking in the building.",9.0
"I reported the window issue on October 26th, so please ensure it is fixed the next time someone books the unit.",9.0
There was an issue with this condo but Julia upgraded us to another unit nearby before check-in. The other unit was spotless and as described.  Seamless check-in and check-out.,9.0

"If you are staying in the Plateau, I found this very central studio to be worth splurging a bit. I have stayed twice with this wonderful host and had fun activities both times right in the neighborhood. There is lots of attention to detail in her studios with pretty decor and kitchen appliances, and coffee and tea provided. It really suited my needs for both a 2 week stay and a quick overnight on a separate occasion. Really welcoming vibe from host and almost always quick replies to messages. Thank you so much Alexia!",9.0

"Alexia is an adorable host, very responsive and very helpful. She kept my luggage at her place so I could enjoy my last day in Montreal. Communication was easy and efficient! A great host!

The apartment is however quite poorly insulated from noise (good thermal insulation though) and the fridge is noisy. You'll need earplugs for a longer stay. 

Very good location!",9.0
Very nice studio in a great neighborhood. Everything you may need and much more was provided,9.0
"Alexia is an amazing host, the apartment has everything you could ask for and the location is ideal. Montreal is an amazing city and everything is easily accessible from this location. I will book again with her in the very near future! The best part was that this apartment was sparkling clean, animal and smoke free, something that was a must for me as I have allergies.

Alexia went out of her way to communicate with me and allow an early check-in. She held my bag in her own apartment at checkout so that I could hang out in the city until my later flight and even put the bag in her cabinet so that her adorable kitty Igor couldn't get hairs on it as I am allergic.

In the apartment there was coffee and tea for guests to enjoy. She has a helpful booklet of how everything works and what is nice in the neighborhood to explore. She provides hand-knitted slippers for guests to wear! The apartment is perfect for one person or a couple with plenty of towels, a hair dryer, extra blankets, a tub for soaking, and a full kitchen. There is even a balcony and if it wasn't November and freezing outside I would have taken Alexia up on having my tea out there! 

The apartment is a few blocks away from the most incredible park, Mount Royal, and even though it was chilly I went in to walk in the woods every day. The charming Plateau and Mile End neighborhoods are also right outside the door. It is a quick walk to downtown or a practically instant bus ride on the 55. I particularly enjoyed a gluten-free bakery called Boulangerie Baked2Go Allergen Free, the adorable Edmond cafe canteen, and a health food store all within a couple of blocks. Lots of vintage shops on the main drag close by, St Laurent. It was a ten-minute walk to Parc La Fontaine and the best poutine that was also able to be gluten-free at a super cute cafe La Banquise. This was my first trip to Montreal and I could not have asked for a better host or apartment. I felt like a native coming home to the charming plant-filled foyer. What a wonderful city!

I had such a great trip visiting the Manifesto exhibit at MAC, a film festival was going on and I was able to catch a French language movie,  I got a new tattoo at the nearby Minuit Dix Tattoo from an outstanding artist Charline Bataille and bought a handmade winter coat at the incredible Kanuk store down the road that had a 50% off sale. A magical first trip thanks to Alexia's charming apartment and its wonderful location!",9.0

"This quiet, cozy apartment is in the very best location of Old Montreal. Walk to restaurants, entertainment, the Old Port, and shopping. Very safe neighborhood, which was important since I traveled alone. The loft was well maintained and very clean. Nice shower with ample hot water, plenty of towels, air conditioned, comfy bed. I usually don't sleep well when traveling, but I had no problems here. Two sunny windows added to the charm. There is an elevator in the building so it was easy for me to get up and down with luggage. Check-in and check-out was very easy and the building is secured at night. Yanick was a great host and made sure there was coffee, fresh fruit, plenty of bottled water, and some nice breakfast items. I can't wait to come back to this charming loft!",10.0

"Located on the oldest street in the city of Montreal, in Old Montreal by the port, this cozy loft with double bunk beds is just steps away from restaurants and shops. Yanick provided basic snacks and breakfast foods, and the loft was just perfect. It’s a fabulous place to stay! A 20 minute walk from downtown Montreal, and just a few minutes from the riverwalk. Great place.",10.0
"The location is nice, inside the old Montreal. It's a 9-minute walk from the nearest subway station on a hill street, which isn't easy when you're with luggage, so I suggest using a taxi, Uber or something on arrival and departure.

The place is really good, with some food in the fridge. 

We had a really great time there and I do recommend it.",10.0

"Christopher's place is beautiful, very bright with lots of natural light, seemed recently renovated with some retro touches. The location is perfect, such a great neighborhood with lots of cafes, restaurants and shops within walking distance. The market is wonderful, too, and so close! The patio is epic, but you do need to go up a fire escape to get to it, so if heights aren't your favorite, that's a little intense. WiFi signal isn't very strong on the ground floor, we couldn't get Netflix to work. And it was my first time interacting with a third-party for check-in and questions: check-in and -out were seamless, but a homeowner's familiarity with the neighborhood and house was missing. Still, it's a great place for a really reasonable price, I would absolutely recommend.",10.0
"Perfect place in a great neighborhood. Clean, cute, narrow two-story building. I loved it.",10.0
"The place is super... This will be my first choice when I return to Montreal. I loved the neighborhood and cafes, convenience store, bakery, as well as Marché Jean-Talon, the price is perfect, not too high and not too low... It's a ""keeper""... Christopher is very responsive and cooperative, wow thank you! Nice terrace too. Metro 5-7 minutes walk and parking spots are very accessible in the surrounding streets.",10.0
Perfect location for this lovely house with a perfect terrace!,10.0
"Great location, close to Marche Jean Talon, parks, the metro, and restaurants.  A great family-friendly neighborhood. A clean, well-laid-out apartment with a beautiful rooftop deck.",10.0
"Christopher's place is one of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. It is spacious, well-lit, and amazingly clean. The location is perfect, only a few blocks from the subway to downtown. We got the 3-day unlimited metro passes which work on the bus and subway, which worked out really well for us. The home is only a few blocks from the Jean Talon Farmer's Market, the largest farmer's market in North America. The kitchen in the home is full of everything you would need to cook for dinner. There is even a rooftop terrace for dining. So many great things. The one drawback is that the listing says there is air conditioning and it worked so poorly, I don't think you should count on that. It was very hot in Montreal the weekend we went and we just couldn't get the house cool with the air conditioner. Other than that, everything was great and I highly recommend this home!",10.0
"The apartment is very well equipped and especially the rooftop terrace is magnificent! We have enjoyed it a lot! The Jean-Talon market is within walking distance, we also take advantage of that, it's super. The house is on a corner street so it might be a bit noisy at night, but with the windows closed, we don't hear anything, it's well isolated :)",10.0
"Excellent reception, very professional from the agency staff and the departure was made easy.
The house perfectly suited our needs in a friendly neighborhood with shops and life. (very Montreal) A bakery right next door and a supermarket open until 10 PM served us well.",10.0
"The apartment is very functional, comfortable, clean and pleasant. It is ideally located (pleasant neighborhood near Jean Talon market, metro...). 

The only minor drawback (and this will depend on perspectives), it is an apartment that is primarily intended for rental, so a bit impersonal (doesn't have the charm and lively character of an inhabited apartment).",10.0
Amazing location. Very clean place. The rooftop patio is awesome,10.0

"Christopher's house was perfect: super clean, perfect location (we spent our days at Café Larue, Le Pain dans les Voiles, Marché Jean-Talon and at Parc Jarry - all within 5 minute walk), communication was flawless and the rooftop terrace was a very nice plus. I would go back in a heartbeat. Highly recommended!",10.0
"Christopher's place was the best choice we could have made. The house was very cute, artistic, super clean and organized, and had everything you might need. Christopher had thought of every detail, such as extra pillows of different quality, and supplies for the house needs.  The house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood with a mini store across the street and two metro stations within walking distance. It is perfect, especially for longer stays like ours. I would totally recommend it to everyone. It can really make you feel like a local in Montreal! Thank you Christopher for your hospitality!",10.0
"This house in Villeray is as clean, spacious, and charming as it looks! We stayed for seven weeks and fell in love with the space and the neighborhood. Christopher is super prompt with responding to any questions and check-ins and check-outs were both smooth. The proximity to metro stations, Jean Talon Market, Little Italy, and so many amazing cafes, coffee shops, bakeries, and restaurants makes Christopher's place an ideal base for your Montreal trip.",10.0

Mario and Michaela were very friendly and helped make it a great three days in Montreal.",9.0
"Imagine swimming in an indoor pool in the sky while it's snowing outside. Pretty epic. The apartment itself had all modern fixtures and conveniences, but no microwave or toaster oven. Futon couch is probably great for travelers intending to use it as an additional bed, but as a couch it leaves a bit to be desired. Also, the TV has no cable or other service (not even OTA coverage), so bring an HDMI cable to plug in your computer. Amazing location, super close to many bars and restaurants and convenient to many points of interest.",9.0

I'll be back!!",10.0

Hosts need a bit more Airbnb experience before I can highly recommend.",10.0
"Sajjad is an amazing host. He gave me great tips and he was always communicating to make sure everything was good (not every day, just the right amount of times). The place is strategically placed; it has a pool and a gym which are great, and all the services you need. You just need to take into consideration that the bed doesn't have a base (as indicated on the page) and the couches are kind of old. If you don't mind these things, then this place is an amazing place to stay. For me, it was amazing; there's a mall below the building with everything you need, and quick access to the metro station.

Easy and quick exchanges and communication, simple and smooth check-in and check-out, superb clean apartment, sunny and tastefully decorated with a beautiful terrace offering a nice view, enough space for storing personal belongings and feeling ""like home"", functional and complete equipment (or if something is missing, like a hairdryer in our case), the very friendly and attentive Jason will bring it to you within hours), well-served neighborhood by public transportation and lively (which doesn't prevent enjoying a pleasant calm in the apartment), etc.

If we really had to offer a critique, maybe one could suggest installing speakers to listen to your own music? That's really all...

In short: try it as soon as possible, even if you live in Montreal and want to have a nice weekend getaway! My friend and I will definitely return to Montreal and won't look for anything else. We've already recommended the place to some friends.",10.0

The deck is absolutely stunning with a gorgeous view & a vegetable garden. We ate tomatoes from it! The kitchen is stocked with lots of things you'd need to cook. Although the place is conveniently-located just off St. Laurent, it's quiet. The bed is new & very comfortable & the shower is really nice. Just across the street is one of the best cafes in the city, Cafe Sardine, which at night turns into a restaurant (same chef as at Toronto's Guu). Walking distance to more great restaurants, grocery & organic food stores, a pharmacy & lots of shopping. If Jason's apartment is available to rent, it'd be a good idea to snap it up! There aren't many places like this to rent in Montreal & in the best neighbourhood.",10.0

I was also very impressed by the cleanliness and presentation of the flat overall. Thank you, Jason!",10.0

For those who don't know the area; this is in the prime area of Mile End. Plenty of great shops, restaurants, cafes and bars literally around the corner.

For all that, it is amazingly residential and quiet too. The roof terrace is one of the best I've seen and makes a wonderful location for your breakfast or dinner!

Thanks Jason.",10.0

Cons:

Noise late at night and early in the morning. 
Being at the bottom of the staircase means you hear everyone going up and down the stairs at all hours.
Being near the main entrance, you hear the front door constantly slamming.
The building's location is great, however traffic noise is quite loud. Not recommended for light sleepers unless you can sleep with earplugs. 
Construction noise from the building during the day.
The host was good at responding (a plus) except when I arrived for check-in and couldn't get a reply. This was especially stressful since it was my first stay on Airbnb.",9.0

It's ideally placed and the place itself is amazing!,10.0
"Nimi's place is in a great location, close to all the attractions Montreal has to offer, and the apartment is much larger than it appears from the outside, with very high ceilings and a very comfortable living area. Nimi was great in providing everything that would be needed for our stay and the parking was very much appreciated. The place was decently clean except for large parts of the apartment having dusty floors. The TV did not work as well, which was a bit disappointing, but the excellent WiFi made up for that.",10.0

"Beautiful place, very spacious! I enjoyed it a lot. Just don't park outside the place, or you'll get a ticket.",10.0
"Nimi was quick to respond when we booked. She took us in when our previous booking cancelled on us the night before we arrived at Montreal. The apartment exceeded our expectations, with nice touches that gave a homely feel. 

Nimi even sent her son to help us settle in, who was totally helpful, even following us to show us the parking spot around the back, and helping us with the luggage. 

It's exactly as per their listing description, plus it's quite close to the city center which is a big plus. The place was also spacious with a nice area for the family to gather around for card games and TV. A convenience store is just around the corner with another larger supermarket just a few blocks down. 

We would definitely consider this again if we ever return to Montreal! Thanks Nimi, you and your son have been awesome!",10.0

I chose to walk to the Airbnb; I got lost for a second but it was pretty straightforward once I went through the TransCanada parking lot. This was the first private room that I stayed in while using Airbnb, Rachelle made the experience very chill and exceptional. I highly recommend this room!",10.0

"Conveniently located close to the airport (a 30-minute walk), this room is located in the solarium of the house, making it suitable for a short overnight stay. For me, that was all I needed due to my overnight layover, but if you want more privacy, she has other rooms available in the house which are in very good condition, clean and ready. She's very kind, always ready to help and cares for your comfort and well-being during your stay. I highly recommend her.",10.0
"The room is better than the pictures; there's more furniture now in the apartment, maybe the photos should be updated. The metro is very close, with supermarkets, restaurants, coffee shops, and services nearby. It's a safe and quiet neighborhood. 

It's perfect for someone looking to relax rather than having the Canadian experience of living with a family as Will is a student. Despite being busy, he is always open to help you and provide you a good experience.",9.0
"Great value accommodation.  As long as you're okay with shared student-style kitchen and bathroom facilities, you'll have a wonderful stay!",9.0
"William was a gracious host who had everything set up for me upon my arrival. The space was clean and pleasant, and the room I stayed in had a locking door, which made me feel secure leaving my belongings there when I went out (there are multiple, separate rooms in the apartment). He responded promptly to any messages I sent him and ensured that my stay was a great experience. Cheers!",9.0
"The place is great for the price, there are some minor things to note. The room was spacious and large, but ventilation to the main room with the AC was subpar. You will feel very uncomfortable if there is a heat wave. Aside from that, the facilities were modern and all functional. The location is somewhat close to the subway; a 5-minute walk to Joliette station, and the 29 comes right outside the door. For the price, you can't go wrong.",9.0
"Beautiful space, clean and well-located. We don't feel like we are in the intimacy of the hosts",9.0
"William was extremely quick with his communication and his location was near the metro station. Air conditioning was helpful during the summer heat, and the room locks.",9.0
"William is an amazing host, he was so understanding of any issues I had during my stay. The room seemed bigger than the pictures which is nice, and the common areas are quite large aside from the bathroom being on the smaller side. I would just note that there can be up to 6 other guests during your stay, alongside 2 long-term houseguests. While we had 10 people in one bathroom which was a lot, but if you're comfortable with shared spaces between a lot of people then I definitely recommend William's place especially for the price. The metro is maybe a 5 minute walk, super close!",9.0

"We are very pleased with our recent experience at Veronique's place. The space aligns with the pictures and descriptions; very nicely renovated condo, with lots of space. We were traveling with our two daughters and they felt as welcome as we did. There was everything we needed, and more. We were pleasantly surprised with thoughtful little details. There were little notes around the condo to help us find our way, which was very helpful. We were also provided with a detailed list of things to do and great spots nearby.

Great location; proximity to amenities and public transportation (2 metro stations within walking distance). 

Excellent communication; Veronique was quick to answer any questions I had as we were preparing for our trip, but once we arrived everything was perfect so we did not need to reach out.

Overall, the space met and even exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be verifying availability here for our next Montreal vacation. Thank you for a wonderful week!",10.0
"Exactly as described, highly recommended.",9.0
The apartment was exactly as photographed. Beautiful and clean place with great amenities. I would choose Sonder's again as a host. They provide 24/7 service and replied in a timely manner.

"We absolutely adored our stay in Montreal and our accommodation!

"Overall, wonderful location close to attractions and public transportation. Very clean and looks even better than the photos! Had issues with the door code and door system over our 4-day stay, but customer service was easily accessible both times.",9.0
"This was a prime location as it is central to local spots and is within walking distance to many essentials, such as grocery stores, cafes/coffee shops, restaurants/takeaways, and convenience stores. 

Sonders provided exemplary service from providing a functioning iron and ironing board upon our arrival, as well as offering 24-hour support when we had any questions or concerns. 

Two minor details of improvement would be to provide a full-length mirror in the apartment as taller individuals, like myself, have to kneel down in order to view themselves in the bathroom mirror. Secondly, an extra throw blanket for those cold winter nights would have made our stay even more enjoyable. 

Overall, staying with Sonder was a pure delight.",9.0

"I highly recommend Touria's accommodation. It is very well located in Montreal (the charming Masson Street with restaurants, bars, and shops a minute away), it is clean and very pleasant. Moreover, it is particularly quiet. There is a large ""walk-in"" closet in the room, and the bed is very comfortable. Touria will be happy to guide you through Montreal with kindness and proximity. A real pleasure to stay at her place!",10.0
"My stay with Touria was wonderful. She warmly welcomed me and quickly made me feel at ease. Absolute comfort. All the rooms were clean and well-ventilated.

She speaks with such sweetness and elegance. She's so pleasant and very welcoming. It was a real pleasure to stay with Touria. I will definitely return if the opportunity arises and I highly recommend her to everyone.

The area where they live is a beautiful one, with two parks nearby, which are very nice. Everything is excellent; I'm sure I would stay there again if I return to Montreal",10.0
"Alex's place is in a fabulous location. Tons of shops and restaurants are right nearby. The subway is only a 7-minute walk away. The place was very clean and tidy, looking exactly like the pictures. Alex was very friendly and offered us tips about some great places to check out. It does get quite hot in the apartment since there's no air conditioning. The room gets direct sun for most of the day and the curtains are quite sheer. There was a table fan in the bedroom that helped a bit, but we didn't sleep well. The bed was smaller than I expected. It looked like a queen in the photos but it was a double, so it's a bit snug for 2 people if you're used to stretching out when sleeping.  It sits on a large piece of wood on the frame instead of a box spring, so it creaks loudly anytime someone moves. We also found the pillows to be very thin. Overall though, for the price, it was a good deal. If you're looking for a budget place to stay, I would recommend staying here as you can't beat the location!",10.0

It's very walkable to local restaurants, cafes and shops. There is also a nice fruit market within 5 to 10 minutes walking distance. If you are coming in the summer, it's important to know that there is no air conditioning in the apartment but there is a fan in the bedroom. The place is very neat and tidy with a kitchen you can use to prepare meals. When I went, Alexandra was not in town so I had the whole place to myself.

"Writing this review for my mother: 

My husband, 1-year-old daughter, and my parents went on an impromptu trip to Montreal for 5 days and we stayed at Victor's Airbnb. His place is a second-floor apartment with an outdoor staircase (typical in Montreal) and is pretty cool. His apartment is all brand new and renovated; we instantly felt like home. It's centrally located, and the train station is within a couple of blocks and possibly a 5-10 minute walk (longer for us because we had my parents and a stroller in tow lol). The parking signs in Montreal are pretty confusing, but we had a lot of help from the neighbors who explained it to us. We had no problem finding parking literally across the street from the apartment.

What was also great was the lockbox! We didn't have to wait for him to enter or to leave him the key. Communication was effortless and he always answered our questions in a timely manner. The apartment had everything we needed to literally feel comfortable. 

Overall, we would definitely come back and stay at his Airbnb and highly recommend it!",9.0
"Great location and Victor was very responsive. Check-in was seamless. We didn't have enough towels, but otherwise we had everything we needed.",9.0

Great times,9.0
"Beautiful apartment in Montreal. After our arrival, Victor provided us with some items missing in the apartment: towel, soap, salt, etc. Just to take into account: the apartment is extremely clean, but it misses basic elements to maintain the kitchen clean (scourer, for instance). The stairs are difficult to climb, and regarding the location, you need more than 30 minutes by foot to reach Place des Arts.",9.0
"Perfect location. We had a great time exploring, eating and drinking through Montreal neighborhoods.",9.0
"Translation: Very nice place, I'll be back next time.",9.0
"Victor's apartment is in a fantastic location. Just one block off St Denis, it's central yet relaxed and peaceful. There's a fabulous Japanese restaurant with outstanding ramen at the foot of the road, a bakery with every imaginable pastry less than two blocks away, two Zagat-listed bistros within a 5 minute walk, and an organic grocery store just steps from your front door on St. Denis. The metro is close, but you can also walk to McGill University, up Mont Royal for amazing views, and over to Mile End for funky food and fashion. The apartment itself is super clean and comfortable.",9.0

"The host was very accommodating and extremely sweet. She took great care of us. The room that we stayed in looked amazing and was clean until we looked behind the bed. There was a lot of dust or sawdust – not sure which and unfortunately my nephew got allergies as he is allergic to dust. The home needs some TLC. The bathroom was also not in a great shape; there was a hole where the toilet paper roll was, but it was fixed the very next day, which was great. The unfortunate part is that we didn't realize it was a shared bathroom with other guests, which was quite annoying as we are quite picky people. It is mentioned under house rules that it is a shared bathroom. I wish this was written upfront on the summary page. Also, whenever we wanted to go back to the house, we had to call the host as we did not have the keys. The host was very accommodating but we felt bad going late. Once again, the host was amazing, very patient and nice, but some things in the house were lacking.",6.0

- Great central location to downtown MTL
- Clean
- Comfy bed
- Carole is very responsive

Could be better
- There was no soap or toilet paper when we arrived. I notified Carole and she was reachable right away. Luckily she had extra supplies in a nearby unit so I was able to restock our place. 
- The place was a bit cold because the heating unit was off. We had to leave it on the whole time to keep the place some what warm.
- The apartment overall was a bit dated

Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone else. We didn't stay long at the apartment and just needed a place to sleep so the dated look and temperature of the apartment wasn't a big deal.

Great value!",10.0
"The building is an amazing area for food and shopping. The balcony has a nice street view, and the space inside is adorable. 

I would definitely book with Carole again for another trip.",10.0

"If you're looking for a typically Montreal place, cozy and well-located, don't hesitate. Pascale is incredibly kind and available. We appreciated her little attentions. The accommodation is functional, very well equipped and clean. Her decor inspired by her many travels makes us feel good immediately. Moreover, the accommodation is located in a very pleasant neighborhood, quiet and dynamic at the same time.  A 2-minute walk away, you'll find a large park as well as all the necessary amenities. You can easily stroll around.

This was a great experience for us.",10.0
Very pleasant and well-located accommodation. Pascale is very responsive and has helped us choose good restaurants and shops nearby. Thank you,10.0
"Karim was a great host and the place looked just like the pictures.

"We stayed for a short 3 days, it was a lovely place. We were able to walk everywhere and at night the area was quite. The rooftop patio was excellent! The host was very responsive and it was easy to check in. Coffee on the balcony in the mornings was a nice way to start the day. Only thing was maybe a roll of paper towels or napkins would have been great. 
Carrie from Boston.",9.0
"The night we arrived, there was a fire in the neighborhood and it made getting onto the street where the Airbnb is located an extremely stressful process. Obtaining the keys/check-in/parking required several steps which added to the stress we were already experiencing (I imagine that the check-in process would not have been so stressful under normal circumstances but the check-in process could have been simpler - just something to be aware of). 

Having said that, the apartment itself is lovely (very spacious and clean) and the hosts were extremely helpful and responsive once we were checked in. They were flexible and made our stay comfortable. The space is located near metros and is walkable to major downtown areas and attractions.",9.0
"Excellent location. However, the atmosphere is very impersonal and the host did not respond to our emails during our stay for problem resolution.",9.0
"Perfectly located with ample space, the check-in process is quite complex and requires a smartphone and internet connection to complete.",9.0
The host cancelled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated message.,9.0
"We had a bad experience. Arriving in Montreal, we found the key not in the designated location. Upon calling the host, we were told that our unit was unavailable due to flooding. Despite booking months in advance, we only received an email hours before our expected arrival (which was not useful due to being out of range). We were then told that no other unit was available and that they ""were having a bad day, too"". We had to scramble to find a last-minute hotel.",9.0
My dad loved it! Thanks!,10.0
"We really loved our stay at Nikki's place. We communicated very easily with our host whenever we had questions. The place was spick and span upon our arrival, and Nikki had left us some towels for bathing which we really appreciated. The Airbnb's location is very well situated; it's close to St-Laurent and St-Catherine streets, which are cool if you love to shop. Unfortunately, there was no available street parking during our stay, but we parked our car at Excentris Public Parking, which is a 5-minute walk from the Airbnb. We wouldn't hesitate to come back to Nikki's place if we had the chance!",10.0
Beautiful place and great location!,10.0
Exactly as pictured. Nikki was a great host and the location was amazing.,10.0
"Almost immediately after sending my request, Nikki accepted it and was available to answer my questions. When I entered the apartment, I was impressed by its cleanliness. Plus, it smelled good. The balcony offers a beautiful view of a typical Montreal street. It is located at the beginning of Plateau, just above the Quartier des spectacles, Quartier Latin, and downtown.  It's two blocks from Prince-Arthur Street, Saint-Laurent Boulevard, and Saint-Louis Square. The apartment also has a beautiful hardwood floor. Everything went smoothly. I encourage anyone wanting to spend time in Montreal to choose Nikki's accommodation. It's better than staying at a hotel, that's for sure!",10.0
"Nikki's place is a short walk from anywhere you want to be in Montreal. I didn't need to drive or Uber anywhere the whole time I was there. The place itself is completely new, clean, and modern. Nikki was very quick to respond to any of my inquiries (and hooked me up with an awesome poutine spot :) Would highly recommend to anyone visiting this wonderful, unique city!",10.0
Perfect spot. You won't be disappointed!,10.0

"The space is exactly like the pictures, and it's very clean, cozy, and quaint. It's in a great location—walkable to Mount Royal as well as local bars, shops, and restaurants.

I had a lovely stay at Nikki's place for a solo adventure to Montreal for 3 nights. It was incredibly clean and looked brand new. There is a lovely terrace in the back that is very quiet and overall the building and apartment were super quiet. The location is perfect—not far from everything you need in the Plateau but on a pretty quiet residential street. Nikki was very easy to communicate with and gave me updates as needed. I'd highly recommend this place.,10.0

I highly recommend staying here",10.0
"Nikki's place is an amazing spot to stay in Montreal — centrally located in Le Plateau with great coffee shops, bars, restaurants and breweries nearby. Especially great is the proximity to Mont-Royal if you enjoy running outdoors. The apartment is very charming with a cute small back porch. We arrived to find it very clean, and the AC worked great (necessary in the 90+ degrees we had this August). There is also Netflix connected on the TV. The only (small) downside is that the shower pressure isn’t great.",10.0
This was a great apartment for visiting Montreal. It's in a cool neighborhood and easy to get around town from here. Nikki was very responsive and a helpful host.,10.0
"A very cute and comfortable spot right by all of Montreal's hip areas. A 10-minute walk from Mont Royal, Chinatown, about a 20-minute walk from downtown. Super super clean and convenient. The only problem was that the internet went out at one point and this issue wasn't resolved for the rest of the stay. It wasn't a huge problem since there are plenty of cafes in the neighborhood, but it wasn't ideal. It didn't ruin the trip though!",10.0
"Nikki is a fantastic host and the place is spectacular! It's not large but it's stylish, clean, and cozy, a bachelor suite right next to St Laurent with lots of shops, restaurants, and bars.

"This was the best Airbnb we've stayed in! Everything was clean and in great condition. We were so impressed with the quality of the apartment. When we booked, we wondered if the size of the space would be an issue, but the finishes are beautiful and the apartment is very well laid out, cozy, and highly functional. 

The thing that really impressed us the most was how well equipped the kitchen was. As a couple who tends to cook a lot, this was greatly appreciated. We've noticed that a lot of Airbnb hosts say they have a well-equipped kitchen, but they just have a few plates, glasses, and cutlery. This place has everything you would need: non-stick pans, nice knives, cutting boards, can opener, baking sheets, strainer, salad bowl, French press, toaster...everything. There was also oil, vinegar, coffee, etc. The kitchen also has a nice layout with great counter space and a bar to eat at.

The location is great. We were within walking distance to grocery stores, shops, pubs, and cafes. It was a nice neighborhood, quiet and safe. We also had no trouble walking from there to many of the attractions we wanted to see, including Old Montreal. However, the Metro is close by (Sherbrooke station) and can quickly get you anywhere you need to go.

Nikki and Jean-Louis were great hosts. We would definitely stay here again.",10.0

There were also nice tips left for you if you're not familiar with the area. We were very happy that we found this place and hope to return in the future. Thanks Nikki!",10.0

"Great place, well decorated, clean and in a prime location. My only criticism is that there was no lockbox and we had to coordinate times with the owner to pick up/drop off the keys.",9.0
"Nice spot, good location. However, perhaps this was just an unfortunate anomaly, but the apartment hadn't been cleaned between the last guest(s) and myself, so I had to do that myself - not a great way to start a trip. Also, I had an issue with getting into the apartment as the host was unable to meet me. Essentially, I had to wait in the lobby for a stranger to let me in.",9.0
"The accommodation is very well located but Ikram would benefit from tidying up a bit to leave space for travelers to settle in: fridge, bathroom etc.",9.0
"Cute little condo south of Griffintown, 3 minutes from the Lachine Canal. However, this location means a bit of a hike to the nearest metro station for the 'happening' parts of Griffintown restaurants, shops, and nightlife. Unfortunately, the area is currently undergoing extensive construction. Ikram was a good host with excellent communication, quick to respond to requests or questions - unfortunately we had a few hiccups with arrival and towels, etc., but we managed to sort them out in the end.",9.0

No response to emails, SMS or calls because it is a fake number for the Airbnb announcement. Once on site, and without any new information, the apartment doesn't exist, or at least the host doesn't exist in the concierge records. This is how day J went, after hours of travel, that I had the pleasant surprise of having no accommodation with the only solution: the hotel. In short, the host and the lodging must be banned.",2.0

We especially appreciated that there was plenty of coffee and sugar. Our kids loved that there was a basket of snacks. 

The bed was super comfortable, and our kids happily slept on the twin inflatable mattresses provided. They were the nice tall ones that would be comfortable for adults, too. 

The location was fantastic! It is close to many great shops, restaurants, and bakeries and a quick walk to the metro. Even though it is on a fairly busy street, we heard almost no noise in the apartment. The private terrace was amazing as well. 

Hamza was readily available through chat and quickly responded to every question we had. We would gladly stay at Hamza's apartment again!",10.0

The apartment was surprisingly quiet even though the bedroom overlooks a busy street that had an end-of-summer street festival going on. We (and our three-month-old baby) had no issues with street noise at any point during the stay.

"Thank you for being such a gracious host, Hamza. I could not have asked for a better host for our weekend getaway. 

The place was fantastic. It is clean, modern, spacious and inviting. Plenty of clean linens and extra blankets. The patio and its large double sliding doors open up the space to the outdoors. Access to the place is simple and off a main street. Parking can be tough to find at times if you do drive, but I find that true for Montreal generally speaking.

The location was convenient, about a 10-minute Uber ride to downtown. About a 5-minute walk to the closest metro station. Close to some popular restaurants, most of which are about a 15-20 minute walk.

Hamza was an excellent host. He checked in with us to make sure things were going well. He was always helpful, responded quickly to inquiries and questions. Ensured that our stay was enjoyable and that was his top priority. I had peace of mind while we were at this place.

I would definitely stay here again when visiting Montreal in the future!",10.0
"Wonderful apartment, conveniently and centrally located for those looking to explore the city. The apartment was very clean and inviting, just as advertised. For those visiting during summer, the central air is a big plus.

"""The bed was very comfortable."" — My husband.
My husband spent several days at the apartment — and really enjoyed the neighborhood. He said there was a coffee shop right there, practically in the same building. He said the apartment was very comfortable, especially the mattress in the bedroom. He even researched it so we can buy it for our home.
He noted the place had a “weird” layout, with industrial-like flood lights and back door he hesitated to open, because he was afraid to trigger some alarm. He was happy the place was comfortably warm in the cold weather. Overall he enjoyed his stay.",10.0

"My fiancé and I came to Montreal for a weekend getaway, and I usually visit twice a year to see family and try out new restaurants.  We stumbled upon Hamza's home after our original host cancelled our reservation, and, to be quite honest, we're glad it was cancelled because Hamza's home was absolutely stellar. It was so much more than we expected: spacious, clean, and equipped with all the necessary amenities that anyone would need. We can't wait to come again, and we're certainly going to be staying at Hamza's! We've found our home away from home. Thanks so much for being an amazing and attentive host!",10.0
Fantastic location and clean!,10.0
"The location is fantastic – the neighborhood has lots of character, and everything is within walking distance, including some of the best food, music venues, shops, etc. It’s also conveniently located near the metro.

The apartment was clean, well-equipped, and spacious for a one-bedroom. It has a long and thin open layout with the kitchen separated from the living room/bedroom by a hallway. Polished concrete floors are stylish but slightly cold on the feet – maybe worth packing slippers. Some fun touches like the blackboard wall and popcorn machine.

I didn’t meet Hamza, but check-in went smoothly and communication was good. Thanks for a great stay!",10.0

"Seb's place is conveniently located just a few minutes from downtown Montréal -- if proximity is important to you, this could be your place. The floors creak at every step, the towels were stained, and the bathroom was dirty.

As for Seb himself, he was very kind and made sure we were properly accommodated.",9.0

"Berish and his team are dedicated to ensuring that their guests' every need is taken care of, and very quickly, the units are incredibly well-appointed, spacious, and comfortable. The finishes are top notch, from the linens and towels down to the smallest details, not a single detail is overlooked. The view from the rooftop patio is something to experience on a busy weekend in the city. The units are exactly as stated and photographed. This was our second unit in the building on this trip as we needed an extension. Berish and his team immediately addressed our needs for an extension—as they always did with immediate responses—and worked tirelessly to make the transition to another fantastic unit an absolute breeze. Enjoy the rooftop patio with full sun exposure and relaxing large hot tub overlooking the downtown skyline; you will not be disappointed in your choice of any of these units. This building is situated right in the center of a fantastic, vibrant neighborhood with no shortage of phenomenal restaurants, walk-up cafes, and patios for days. We could not have had a better location choice or a better stay. Very satisfied customer. These are true Super Hosts.

"Nice clean place. We had the third floor suite which was two floors. One full bath on the first floor and two bedrooms shared a second full bath on the second floor. The hot tub on the roof was great. Location was okay. If we were to stay again in Montreal, we would probably choose a place closer to downtown/Old Montreal area. Also, the place does not have an elevator which was a slight hassle for luggage. Overall, it was a great place, good value for a small group. We would definitely recommend it.",10.0
"Very nice apartment, very well decorated in modern style. We had plenty of comfortable space in the living room to stroll and chat with friends. The rooftop spa is really appreciated and the terrace is a must-have. A small point to note: please bring some specialized kitchen items if you want to cook during your stay as the kitchen is small and only has a basic set of dishes and a few utensils. Also, the accommodation has a connecting door to another apartment, and soundproofing is missing. But for a group that doesn't aspire to absolute tranquility, it's perfect and never bothered us. The neighborhood is very lively, the metro is however 20 minutes walk away and less accessible. The hosts are very kind, attentive and we would definitely go back without hesitation.

Thank you very much.",10.0

So many good restaurants in the Mile End, you won't need to travel far for an amazing meal.",10.0

"I was in room 303. It's on the third floor and the building doesn't have elevators. It wasn't a big deal to me because I'm still young, but just keep that in mind if you are staying with someone who has trouble with stairs. This place seemed recently refurbished and looked great, however there were a lot of scuff marks on the white walls which again isn't a huge deal for me, it's just something they should fix. In general the whole place was great except for two things. The couch in my living room had a lot of stains on it and I am not a fan of that. The other thing is with the hot tub. The host told me the hot tub guy comes 4 times a week, but there was no evidence he showed up during our stay. The chlorine float had nothing in it and the hot tub didn't smell good the whole time we were there. All in all this place is good apart from those two things that can be easily fixed.",10.0

Quiet street with rather simple street parking (outside of two weekly restrictions), we had no problem finding a spot to park on the block. First floor location made it easy to unpack and the apartment came with heating and AC unit. The bathroom was just the right size with a shower and bathtub. Super comfortable living room and kitchen access made our staycation away from home so delightful. Wonderful backyard space with table and grill to enjoy the warm nights.

"Julia was very responsive to messages and kindly allowed us to check in early. She cleared plenty of space for us in her fridge and granted us use of her washer and dryer, which was a huge help. Her neighborhood is residential, but a few blocks away the area becomes more industrial, with several power plants and smokestacks. The street was very quiet, although we were awoken by a construction crew doing early-morning repairs to the sidewalk. Overall, we had a very nice stay and would stay here again. Thanks, Julia!",9.0
"You get what you pay for. Thinking this was a great deal and not TOO far from the green line via bus, my husband and I booked the bedroom with ensuite bath. The interaction with the host was awkward from the start. My husband and I both heaved our luggage onto the tiny porch while looking for the key in the mailbox. I couldn't see that Julia was inside washing dishes with only the screen door opened. My husband went inside to get the layout while I guarded the luggage. No help from her at all or introduction. Later when we went to the back deck to eat, she repeated 3 times make sure to close the screen door...and seemed befuddled that we would choose to eat al fresco instead of in the stifling living room. The next morning we awoke to banging, drilling, and lots of other noises. Apparently Julia had hired a handyman to do some construction in the house but didn't bother to tell us. Thanks! He was pleasant; just doing his job. We called Julia to see how long he would be there- no response. We opened our windows and the ones in the living room because it was sooooo hot in there and closed them before we left. The next day we did the same but left them opened because the other tenant was enjoying the air as well. The next morning, Julia removed the cranks so the windows could not be opened. Shortly after that we cancelled the rest of our reservation, but not only because of that issue. She was not accommodating AT ALL!!! It was a chore to ask her for toilet paper, especially after she had erected a door between the kitchen and where she stayed. Also she was dressed inappropriately most of the time in a shorter nightgown ( often with no bra) in front of my husband. She even came into the kitchen wearing just a bathrobe when my husband was cooking, reached across him to turn the vent of the stove on instead of going around. I don't know how she got her rating or her supposed hospitality, but she must have left it in Vancouver!!!!",9.0
"Julia was an excellent host. We had to check in late at night but she was kind and welcoming. The price was very reasonable and the room was clean and tidy. It seemed buses ran even at late night around 1-2 am near her place. We had a car so we didn't feel difficult to travel around, but if you are taking public transit it will be tough. Also, although the place is located in a quiet neighborhood, there were still construction going on in the morning so you might feel a little irritated. Overall, it was a great place!",9.0

There are other guests sharing the tiny house who may or may not communicate with you. There is no dining room table at which to eat food nor is there a desk for using laptops. The beautiful backyard has no lawn furniture and there is junk stacked back there which is unfortunate because the green space could be the best feature of the house.",9.0
"Magali was an awesome host. She gave great tips on restaurants and events happening all around the city. She really went above and beyond even tailoring additional information for the event we were in town for (Formula One Race). The check-in was super easy and she was quick to respond during our visit. She also gave accurate and thorough information about the space and its amenities. 

The space was comfortable and exactly what we needed since we were spending most of our days out in the city. Her garden in the back is very charming, and so is the space. It feels like spending time in a friend's home. We will absolutely be back next time we are in Montreal. 

The location also can not be beaten. Everything you need is within walking distance, and the train is a half block away making it a great starting point for visiting everywhere in Montreal. The area is very hip, reminding us a lot of our neighborhood in Brooklyn. Bars, great food, and cafes.",10.0
"We spent a lovely stay in Magali's housing. The flat is quite big, and has a little cute patio where we can have a seat under the sun.

"Robert's place was great and he was very quick with responses! Also, the location was great—I would not hesitate to stay here again. The place was so close to public transportation and an IGA to stock up on food. It was clean and spacious. The internet was a bit slow at times, but we could stream Netflix (there was some buffering required).

There are a few things that I think could be improved. We were two couples staying at the apartment, but we were only supplied with one set of keys and we were told we couldn't have another set. This was very inconvenient for two different couples who wanted to do different things. Also, there was an issue with the oven—we used it to make a frozen pizza, but whoever installed it had left the paper instructions (which were on top of the broiler coil as this is an electric stove) and some other debris in it, like a hard piece of plastic and metal (which were underneath the oven coil at the bottom in the far back corner). We did not see these before we turned the oven on due to their specific locations, so a small fire broke out in the oven. There was no fire extinguisher, so we had to throw water on it. No damage occurred, but it was scary and annoying that no one took these flammable materials out of the oven. Plus there was an awful burning plastic smell after due to the plastic starting on fire. We were lucky the paper instructions did not ignite.",9.0

Beds were a little low but comfortable, and we had no issues sleeping. Air conditioning worked fine. Having the 1 1/2 bathrooms made getting ready much quicker. Having the washer/dryer was also nice though we did not use them.

The highlights, as I said, were that it was clean and the location. We were able to walk to most all locations. We did take the metro which was nearby (Champs de Mar 1 block away). Street parking was not clear where we could park nearby, so we parked at Complexe Desjardins nearby for the duration of our stay.

I would stay here again when we visit Montreal.",9.0
"Robert's place is well located in Montreal, it takes less than 5 minutes to the next Metro station and less than 10 minutes to Old Town. Berri UQAM area, Chinatown, and the Quartier de Spectacles are also within walking distance. 

The place is very spacious and clean, and provided a perfect home base for a family of four during our stay.",9.0

"The unit was spotless and airy. The well-appointed apartment featured comfortable furniture and high-end appliances in the kitchen, including a Nespresso coffee maker. The large main bathroom had a separate tub and shower, along with a decent half bath. There was ample space for two couples or a small family. It was very close to the Metro station and within walking distance of coffee shops, grocery stores, and many restaurants.  It was also conveniently located near Old Montreal and all its amenities. Excellent communication with both the owner and unit manager. Highly recommend this unit for anyone seeking a home away from home while visiting Montréal.",9.0

"We had a wonderful time in Montreal. Robert's flat is in a great part of town and we enjoyed the neighborhood. The apartment was spacious, quiet, and the kitchen had necessities for cooking. 

On the downside, we found the beds and pillows very uncomfortable and the wifi did not work well.",9.0
Nice place. Very clean. Good communication before arrival.,9.0
Robert's place was very clean and the location to the metro was perfect (less than 5 minute walk). The apartment had lots of light and was very comfortable. The second bathroom was nice to have.

"The location was excellent, and the apartment is located on a quiet side street, which is nice when you're staying in downtown Montreal. The price was fair for the location and quality of the home.  The mattresses were incredibly uncomfortable, and the beds were so loud that I would be woken up any time my husband rolled over during the night. Robert was very quick to respond to any of our questions and concerns, which was a great benefit especially when our check-in time was changed (delayed flights) and he was extremely accommodating with changing the check-in time to suit our needs.",9.0

"Spacious and well-located residence. Competitive price. Well-organized reception. However, cleanliness left much to be desired during our stay.",9.0
"Loved staying in Robert's apartment! Very fair price for the place, which is located in a great spot. Most popular attractions in Montreal are within walking distance, and the place is in close proximity to a grocery store. Having Netflix, along with other apps, available on the TV was a pleasant surprise. The WiFi also worked very well. The only thing to be wary of if traveling by car and looking for somewhere to park it for your stay, street parking is not available, so research parking garages ahead (there are some available within walking distance). I’d recommend doing a parking garage especially if you are staying during the winter season.",9.0
"Super central location and spacious apartment. Very neat and clean. The kitchen and dishes were slightly sticky in places. Robert was always reachable and check-in went smoothly. Only problem: Anyone driving to the place should be prepared for massive parking issues. Sometimes you have to search for up to an hour, as you can't park in front of the house and generally need to pay for parking almost everywhere throughout the day.",9.0

The apartment is clean and cozy. The location is great! Alina responds promptly. There's parking behind the building.,9.0
"Alina's place is close to public transportation and many of Montréal's Centre Ville attractions, with a relaxing walk through Parc La Fontaine beginning any adventure. Her home is cozy, quiet, and welcoming, especially for those traveling with a young child (toys!). Parking is competitive and challenging, if you're bringing a car, but would be par for the course to any city dweller. Our stay was wonderful and we'll be back to the city soon, I'm sure. See you later!",9.0

The host is also excellent. He responds back quickly to your emails. When I contacted him that the toilet was broken, he came the very next morning to fix it while we were traveling through Montreal.",10.0
"Though minimalistic, this apartment suited our needs for this trip. The AC unit is in the living room and even though there is a good fan in the bedroom, if you like to be cold when you sleep you may be uncomfortable. The apartment is on a quiet street very close to Chinatown and about 10 minutes from Old Montreal.",10.0
"Great location, clean, quick responses to questions and any needed help. I recommend.",10.0
"The room's greatest advantage is its location. It's very close to Place des Festivals and Notre Dame. It is very spacious and very clean. It has a full kitchen (full-size fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, etc.). Check-in was not a problem. William was a very good host, very responsive to questions and issues. Open air parking is available nearby, costing $17 CAD per day (until 6 am the next day, after that you have to pay another full day).

On the negative side, the room can get hot in the summer and the provided A/C was VERY noisy (one of those portable units and it was situated in the living room, so had to put it at full blast and keep the door open to cool the bedroom). The room definitely did not feel like home, with very poor/cheap decoration and furnishings. The bed was comfortable, however. Overall, it was a budget option. Would look for something more ""homey"" next time.",10.0
"Super clean, 1 bedroom with a pull-out couch in the living room. The host left toiletries and coffee for us to use. Internet was fast. 

Location is unbeatable! So close to Old Montreal...but you have to walk through an amazing-smelling Chinatown to get there...even though we were full from supper at Gibby's, walking back to the apartment through Chinatown made my mouth water!  

Highly recommend this place...the host came early and saved us a street parking spot where we were able to leave the car, for free, all weekend. 

Will definitely stay here again when next in Montreal.",10.0
"Zhan and William are easy to connect with, helpful, and respond very quickly. The apartment was sparkling clean, quiet, and very comfortable, especially the Tempur-Pedic mattress. I haven't slept so well in years. The location was perfect with plenty of food, drink, activities, and entertainment right outside the door. I recommend parking your car in a 24-hour garage and forgetting about it for the duration of your stay as it is rewarding to explore the city by foot or by rented bicycle.",10.0

"We had a great stay at Zhan's place. It was conveniently located within walking distance to the mall and many other shops/restaurants. Zhan was quick to respond to any inquiries and had great communication throughout our stay.

The apartment was tidy and had everything we needed for a pleasant stay!",10.0
"This place was in an amazing location, conveniently located to everything! Loved that we had a parking space. The Airbnb itself was very clean and spacious! Amenities such as soap, shampoo, towels, coffee makers, and wifi were all available. Will definitely come again. Only thing was Netflix wasn't working and the TV was hard to navigate but no biggie!",10.0
"This is the 3rd time I've stayed in this building, this time in this apartment but, as I think any other apartments managed by Zhan/William, the experience was more than positive.

He was unable to meet us at check-in but his friend helped us park the car and even carried our luggage up to the apartment! Parking on site is easy and a welcome amenity in a busy city. We didn't spend much time in the apartment outside of sleeping and getting ready in the morning, but it is just as pictured, clean, bright, and spacious enough for our family and needs. The air conditioning was a welcome relief during a hot August and the beds were comfortable and cozy. I would definitely recommend staying here and when we return next summer, we would consider staying here again if still available.",10.0
Rapid and easy,10.0
Matt's place is cozy. There are two queen beds with comfy comforters and more than enough pillows. He left us 4 clean towels. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need. There's also a balcony with two chairs. There are 2 convenience stores right across the street if you need snacks/beer/wine...super close to the heart of downtown. Matt responds very quickly too. Ubers are very easy to get in the area.,10.0

"Great place! Very clean and spacious. Awesome location. There was some construction happening at the building, but it wasn't an issue. The mattress wasn't the most comfortable thing ever, but I really liked the apartment! Lots of light, full kitchen, and a nice TV!",10.0
"We recently spent a long weekend in Montreal. We had a wonderful time and part of that was because Matt's apartment gave us a place to come ""home"" to at the end of each busy day. The apartment is exactly like the pictures. There were no bad surprises. It is very difficult to find a place in Montreal that has two distinct beds.... not a couch rollout or a blow up mattress. This has two identical queen beds, one in the bedroom and one in the large living room. Everything was very comfortable and very clean! Matt was a great host. Check in couldn’t have been easier and he responded within minutes to everything we asked. I will be staying there again. Matt, thank you so much! We had a wonderful time.",10.0
"Great place to stay. Well decorated, comfortable, and excellent communication with the host",10.0

"Matt was a wonderful host. From the moment I booked the Airbnb he was very informative and within the first couple of days of me booking he had already sent the instructions on how to get into the Airbnb followed by some rules. When arrived at the Airbnb it was exactly how it looked in the pictures. Matt was very helpful when we had a problem turning on the shower; I sent him a message and he was at the Airbnb within 5 minutes to help us out! The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The location of the Airbnb was perfect, just one block away from all food stores and pharmacies and a one-minute walk to the metro. Overall, Matt was a great host and I would definitely recommend his place if you are looking to stay a few days in Montreal. Thanks again, Matt!",10.0
"We were two professionals who stayed at the apartment for 5 nights to attend a conference. The apartment was very conveniently located for our needs (near Concordia University, grocery store, tons of restaurants, and public transportation). It was a safe neighborhood. The apartment itself was okay but spartan (as pictured so true to photos). Two real beds were a great feature. There was nowhere else to sit other than an uncomfortable folded couch and dining table chairs. Missing some very basic things for any Airbnb place: NO maps, tourist information or instructions on how to use the TV and get into Netflix. Only a towel rack was in the shower and NO washcloths or hand towels were provided. We got two large towels each and had to get paper towels from the kitchen to put in the bathroom to dry our hands. The beds were comfortable but don't have top sheets, only a duvet cover. We had to assume and hope that they launder the duvet covers after each guest. It was, on the surface, somewhat clean, although the shower curtain had black mold and there was hair in the drain. There was no stopper for the bathtub. Items in the kitchen (spatula, fridge, and pan) had remnants of food. The hallway outside of the apartment smelled of fried food the entire week. Really bad smell, which isn't the fault of the host, but may be an issue for some. It was nice to have access to a gym on the top floor. Do not stay here if you are counting on using the garage parking. You need a card to get in and out of the garage, which means you need to park on the street (in a very busy area) on arrival and then departure in order to collect/deposit the card in the apartment. Finally, if you are a solo traveler or if concerned about safety, be aware that the keys (only one key was left--we had to ask for a second) are left in the unlocked apartment for you to let yourself in after using a code to enter the building. This and the parking system are not in the description but should be disclosed before paying so people can make more informed choices. Neither of us would stay here again.",10.0

"This is a lovely apartment, perfect for a family of four, provided the children are pre-teens. The sofa bed may be a little small for teenagers.

The location is perfect, with quick walking access to Vieux Montreal and the Old Port. It's also within walking distance from a subway station.

Samuel was gracious enough to let us drop off our luggage at the apartment before 3 pm, explaining that the place would not be cleaned at that time. We dropped off our luggage and went exploring.
When we returned after a walk through Vieux Montreal just after 3 pm, the apartment had been thoroughly cleaned and was ready for us.

Can't beat the location, and the cleanliness. Highly recommended, we liked it so much that we plan to return and also recommend it to our friends and family.",9.0

Overall a great experience and would not hesitate to stay here again :)",9.0

Getting in and out of the place was easy with Carlonie's instructions, bonus: wifi was fast. It's also in a great area, a few steps to anything you need.",10.0
"We very much enjoyed staying at Caroline's place. Our three daughters found the room with two bunk beds and one double very comfortable (although we had to hang a blanket on the window at night because there were no blinds and the street light bothered them).

The flat has everything you need and is quite comfortable. However, the second bedroom where we stayed had some minor issues. Absolutely nothing on the windows - two full walls facing the street and no door to the living room. When it was -29c at night we could not get the room any warmer than 12c. However, these really didn't bother us much and Caroline will probably have fixed all of this by next time.

The kitchen and family room were perfect.

The neighborhood is the best in Montreal. Fantastic bakery three blocks away. St-Viateur bagel just a block away. Excellent grocery store half a block away and open until midnight. Skating at Parc La Fontaine just a 15 minute walk. Metro station is a 10 minute walk away. Lots of shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. We had no problems finding parking on the street during the entire eight days we stayed.

Caroline was an excellent and very responsive host.
Highly recommend.",10.0
"Caroline's place was fantastic. It was spacious for us, a family of 2 adults and 3 little kids. It was clear that Caroline has a sense of style as the apartment was nicely done. It had plenty of sunlight, on a quiet street, but also very close to shops, great restaurants, and very walkable to just about everything. We enjoyed our stay very much and would come back. Caroline was easy to deal with and very considerate. She left us a pile of fresh towels, and got us milk, juices and bread.",10.0
"Caroline, the host, was out of town when we arrived as she had informed us ahead of time. So she made sure we knew how to get in (extremely simple) and had provided us with names of contacts next door. But Caroline was also easily accessible by phone or messaging and responded immediately.

The apartment is just as described. It is spacious, airy, full of natural light and comes with all that one would need for cooking, etc. She even left us some great goodies in the refrigerator.

Location is wonderful - a couple blocks from the Metro, groceries, restaurants, etc.  It was a perfect place from which to explore all of Montreal. The apartment was relaxing, clean and had a wonderful vibe.

We are so grateful to Caroline for sharing it with us (my husband, myself, and my 21-year-old daughter). It would be a great place for two couples or a family with small children too.

Thanks so much!!!",10.0

Check-in and check-out was easy. Well decorated and perfectly clean. 
Large living room very pleasant, three bedrooms with comfortable beds, a bathroom and a shower adjacent to the master bedroom. Small terrace with a few chairs.

Their room is large enough; they welcomed us with our four suitcases. The bed is very comfortable and we slept very well. The whole apartment is very clean. The kitchen is large and many utensils are at your disposal. A Metro supermarket is located within a 10-minute walk of the apartment. Close to bus and metro lines, it is simple and quick to get around the city. The internet is fast enough and powerful for the entire household.

And finally, the two little pluses of the stay are their two cats, Poupoune and Jacob who are really adorable and very cuddly. 

A beautiful address that we highly recommend!",10.0
"Sophie's place was a real gem: a charming ground floor apartment on the Le Plateau in a small street off vibrant Mont-Royal Avenue. Excellent location, couldn't have asked for anything better!!! A stone's throw from the Metro station, bookstores, restaurants, cafes, bars and grocery stores. Also an easy walk to the mountain and the Mile-End. Sophie is an excellent host. She was a great communicator, and made sure everything was perfect. Check in and checkout were seamless. The apartment is stylishly decorated with a lot of personal and artistic touches that make you feel right at home. A beautiful private patio and garden make for wonderful dinners or gatherings outside. Books, music, board games are also at your disposal. Perfect apartment if you are travelling with Kids, or just among a group of friends. The bathroom has all amenities at your disposal. The kitchen is fully loaded with all the basics (and even more). I cooked many meals there during my stay. A little keyboard made for some fun jam sessions. Thank you Sophie for making my trip to Montreal very memorable. Hope to return to this beautiful place.",8.0
This is a fantastic home that clearly shows care and reflects the personal style of Sophie and Axel. Our stay was comfortable and having a backyard was great with little kids.

"Charming apartment with excellent location (bars, restaurants, and shops within a short walk, close to the subway and Bixi station). Very nice hosts.",8.0
"Sophie's apartment is absolutely gorgeous, in a perfect location. We also really appreciated how accommodating she was, as we weren't able to leave Toronto until after work, and didn't get in until 11. Just a couple of things to keep in mind if you're booking Sophie's place however:

- the description currently states that there are queen beds in each of the bedrooms, and a pull-out in the common area, but this isn't the case. There is a large bed in one bedroom, a small bunk bed in the other room, and no couch. We were two couples, which made the sleeping arrangements quite awkward.
- the apartment has a very lived-in feel, with lots of stuff everywhere. This makes it feel very homey, but if you're used to Airbnbs that are more sparse, and don't feel like you're in someone else's space, then Sophie's place is not for you. For instance, the bunk beds were in a children's room that was tidy, but filled with toys, etc., which along with the bunk beds didn't feel appropriate for two adults to sleep in. It had also been a long time since I had stayed in an Airbnb without a lockbox for the key, or a keypad, so arranging for the check-in felt more complicated than usual. 
I would definitely recommend staying here due to the location and beauty of the building, but I think these are important things to consider if you're thinking of staying here, especially if you're more than two adults.",8.0

Luna and her husband are the sweetest people and they have sweet attentions for their guests! The bedroom is absolutely clean, same for the bathroom and the rest of the apartment. The place is very cute because Luna loves to keep many plants so it creates a peaceful atmosphere. I hope you will have the chance to taste some Iranian food that the couple cooks because it is delicious!! If you have the chance to talk with them, you will realize how great their culture (they know many French poets and authors) is and it was pleasant to talk with them. Luna knows some words in French and speaks English, as her husband. I also enjoyed this place because it was calm and the situation was interesting: on Saint Denis street (where you can find restaurants, libraries, shops), you are 5 min by walk from the metro station and like 20-30 minutes by walk to Mont Royal Park.",10.0

The only issue is that she does not offer air conditioning. Although, I had a ""Hi Tech"" fan. So if you need A/C, that is a miss.

I think it's more suitable for younger people less delicate than our habits as a quinquagénaire. 
Thank you in any case to Joe for his responsiveness and welcome.",9.0
"Joe's place is located on a street with plenty to do and is a reasonable walking distance or a quick drive from whatever you want to do. There are also many shops and places to eat nearby!

Winnita and Dan were proactive in making me feel welcome and the place itself had the perfect combination of value, location, charm, and more than enough space. It also had a semi-constant breeze that permeates the place because of its location. 

The place itself felt ""lived in"" and had the touches of someone who had an eye for furniture and design that gives off comfort. I felt at ease in the place immediately.

The only thing missing were in-house laundry and air conditioning, but it was easy to get around it as there is a nearby laundromat and there is a constant breeze. Otherwise, great place 10/10.",10.0

"Christopher was an amazing host! We were able to communicate without delay or problem. Check-in instructions were clear and the location was easy to find. The location is close enough to everything but also far enough to get a peaceful night's rest. Everything was within a short walking distance, including downtown, which was about a 30 minute walk. The closest restaurant and bar were within 5 minutes. The studio was clean and the bed was quite comfortable. We will definitely be coming back and booking in the future!",10.0

"First time using Airbnb and glad it was at Christopher's place.

Nice location and super close to the subway, which made getting around the city so easy!",10.0
"Really great Airbnb experience! I tended to forget how small the unit was because it was set up so efficiently that it seemed larger than it was. The service was really friendly and quick, and the thoughtful touches like laundry tokens, toiletries, and recommendations for places to go were really appreciated. There was a little trouble finding parking but I was warned about that, and the place was within walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants so I only had to worry about finding parking once.

"Philippe is an amazing host, the best we could ever wish for. He made our stay in Montréal unforgettable. He is very friendly and helpful person, anytime we asked him something he did his best to help us and he gave us great advice about the city as well. His place is very clean and full of special atmosphere and I am sure you will feel at home just like you are at home. We had there everything we needed and even more. A big advantage is also the location, close to downtown, with great restaurants, bars and with the bus connection directly in front. We definitely recommend Philippe’s place to everyone and we hope to return one day as well.",10.0
"The place looks even better than in the photos - spacious and spotless, in a great, quirky location close to supermarkets and boutiques. It can feel a little further out from downtown, but it's not too long a walk, and there is a bus that stops right outside the apartment. It's very close to Mont Royal and many parks, so it's set in a beautiful location.

Philippe is an excellent host, quick to answer questions and very hospitable. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to stay in a loud, downtown area but wants to get a feel for the gorgeous Montreal!",10.0

"Raphael charges $25 for a cleaning fee. So at least I expected a clean apartment. The bathroom and kitchen were very dirty. I didn't use either. I wanted to boil some water for tea, but there wasn't any kettle or pot. The bedroom has no lock and is right next to the main door. So, you can hear people coming and going. The bedroom was hot like a sauna, even with the window open. I ended up not sleeping, didn't even shower. 
I arrived around 9pm and left at 8am the next morning. He justified by saying it's only $17/night but with the cleaning, service etc., it ended up costing $48.02 for one night. I didn't use any of the amenities due to the uncleanliness. 
I didn't meet him; I only spoke on the phone. He seemed nice and was communicating throughout the night and asked me to take pictures of whatever wasn't clean because he needed evidence for the cleaning company, which I did and sent it to him. He said he would meet me in the morning to check out the place and refund me the cleaning fee but didn't show up or responded to my messages. The location is good and check-in was easy.",10.0
"Room in a shared apartment very well located as it is close to the metro, numerous shops, restaurants, the university and St-Joseph oratory. Raphael is a very attentive host with whom communication is smooth. Thank you again for his perfect welcome and efforts to make my stay pleasant, I have absolutely missed nothing. I recommend without hesitation!",10.0
"Raphael's room was superb; absolutely a great deal considering the area. The room was very well-kept, and check-in was a breeze. Perfect for any traveler or couple looking for a good place to rest while exploring Montreal. The metro and St. Joseph's Oratory are steps away, and CDN is a lovely neighborhood to roam. Raphael was quick to respond and check in on us, and was a great host. Highly recommend.",10.0
"Awesome location, this room was in a very convenient spot to allow you to explore Montreal. The room itself is okay, the place isn't too clean, we actually had to go buy our own toilet paper because there wasn't any and if you're ok with other people staying in the same place as you, then you'll be fine here. Really good host, communicative. The only downside of this place was the cleanliness and how it was unclear about other people also living there. Even so, it was quiet and everyone was respectful of each others space. If you are looking for a place to sleep and semi-shower, this place works great!",10.0

"The owner did not show up on check-in day and was unreachable. We had to find alternative sleeping arrangements for the first night. The owner responded to us the second day, only to tell us that he ""thought"" he sent us the code for the lockbox. When we finally got in, the place was dirty. We had to request that he come clean immediately. Later on, we realized the bathtub was clogged and the oven wasn't working properly. The owner finally fixed everything but it took some time. We made a verbal agreement for a refund, but it has been 15 days and no sight of the money and the owner does not answer when we call him. We are currently involving Airbnb to resolve this situation.",7.0

"This place is highly recommended for travelers who wish to have an authentic Montreal experience, devoid of noisy tourist traps. The apartment has a living room and patio that overlook Av. Wilderton; the airy bedrooms are facing an alley, so guests have privacy and quiet, while still enjoying plenty of sunshine; the queen-sized bed was very comfortable. The inclusive tree-lined neighborhood (with its synagogues, yeshivas, and churches) is charming, quiet, and safe; it is a 20-minute leisurely walk (or 10min ride on the 161 Bus) to Outremont station where one can find trendy cafes, restaurants, and a Mamie Clafoutis boulangerie; Côte des Neiges, with its many Asian restaurants, is also close by. Eating in is very doable; ingredients can be purchased at the Metro Wilderton supermarket (that is just a 2-minute walk away), and prepared in the well-appointed kitchen. Guests with cars will find free street parking in the surrounding streets.

Juliana and Rogerio are fantastic hosts. They are not only friendly, helpful and responsive, but also keep their home spotless, while being eco-conscious. If late check-out is required, Juliana and Rogerio will do their best to accommodate. I would not hesitate staying with Juliana and Rogerio again.",9.0
"Juliana's place is a gem nestled near the Outremont area. You are about a 10-minute walk in either direction from two amazing neighborhoods and Metro stations, making it a great base to explore the city.  The room is quite big and has all the basic amenities. The apartment is minimalistic, stylish, and comfortable. Communication with Juliana is great, and Rogerio (the other host) was friendly and enjoyable to stay with. Overall, highly recommended!",9.0

Highly recommended!",9.0
"Juliana and her roommates were wonderful hosts. I needed to find a place for my parents from out of town to stay for two nights before better arrangements could be made, and their place was perfect. Cozy, intimate, close to groceries, bus stops and numerous other essentials.

"Marine was an unbelievably amazing host. During probably the busiest weekend in Montreal due to the Osheaga music festival, another AirBnB host canceled last minute, leaving my friends and me without a place to stay. With the help of AirBnB and Marine, she accommodated a large group of my friends to stay last minute. She responded immediately and was in touch throughout the entire re-booking process. She and her boyfriend Damien bought us a bottle of wine to welcome us into their home, provided us multiple pairs of keys and checked up on us whenever we needed. Best of all, the place is in a super cool and spacious loft with really fun and interesting decor. I 100% recommend anyone considering visiting Montreal to stay with Marine. I know if I'm coming back to Osheaga next year, I certainly will.

"Very stylish place located very close to many activities, sights, and places to eat. Highly recommend to anyone staying in Montreal.",9.0
Great and affordable loft space near the heart of Old Montreal. A must-stay if you're considering a trip to Montreal,9.0
"Pros: Great location, very spacious
Cons: 
- They had an air mattress as a bed. If I had known this I would not have booked this location. We only had one real queen-size bed and one single bed that sleeps only 3 people. The air mattress provided was subpar and deflated, so two out of five guests had to sleep on a deflated mattress. The Airbnb was not fit for a 5-person stay. I don't know how the listing is for 7 people.
- Checked in at 3:30 PM, but the sheets and towels were not ready. The host indicated that the sheets and towels were still being dried. I agreed that it was okay, but when I got there, the sheets and towels in the dryer were still wet and I needed to dry them a few more cycles before they were ready for use. Check-in was listed at 3 PM, the apartment should have been ready by then, so I don't see how it is acceptable that the apartment wasn't ready by 3:30 PM.
- The host offered a solution to us and suggested giving us a discount for our stay; however, I haven't heard back from them since writing this review.

I hope they fix these issues, as the apartment space and location have a lot of potential to be a great Airbnb for future guests. 

Thanks,
Jet",9.0

Marine was so hospitable and arranged everything for our convenience. In the apartment itself was bright and private, and it had absolutely everything we needed. It made us smile to see that Marine even went out and did a little grocery shopping for us and provided eggs and bacon and a few other snacks! Thank you, Marine! Montreal is now one of my favorite places!",9.0
"It's too bad. She didn't give food for breakfast. And when I checked in, they didn't finish making the bed and never finished it. We made the bed ourselves and finished drying towels. There is no pocket wifi, just wifi in the unit. I saw there are 4 beds, but there are only 2 beds. There is no hairdryer. The only good thing is that it's near the subway station. That's all.",9.0
"Marine and Damien were fantastic hosts! Four slept comfortably in this cozy, well-decorated flat in Old Port. We were greeted by Damien upon arrival and were reassured all questions would be answered at any time (and were answered promptly). Friendly hosts and location were notable highlights! Would recommend this Airbnb to friends and family visiting Montreal.",9.0
"I had to sleep on the floor because the house says it's for 6 people but definitely is for 4. The air bed didn't work, I could only sleep the two nights and I ended up with a neck injury at the end of my stay. If you have more than six people, I don't recommend this place. Upon our arrival, the bathroom was filthy...and used, not really clean! And if you are in a rush and leave some dirty dishes, they will charge $200 USD. Be careful",9.0
"Stylish place with great location. No TV or couch, but that's okay. Would recommend.",9.0
"If you're interested in exploring Old Montreal, this is the place to be. Very comfortable, great for cooking too.",9.0
"**Pro:** Good location, good communication and basic necessities/cookware were available. The marine was almost always available if we needed help and gave some recommendations for places to go (Website hidden by Airbnb).

**Con:** The furniture and cabinets were all rundown, falling apart or peeling. The cleaner didn't do a good job and there were lots of random specks of black stuff on the ground and hair on the sink.  I found a few bugs (not bedbugs) on one of the mattresses. We had two comforters for four beds so my mom was really cold even with several of the small fleece blankets provided. There was no toilet paper, and we had to drive around the city to find a supermarket that was still open after 10 pm (this after a grueling 12-hour drive, so you'll have to forgive me for being nitpicky), but the marine reimbursed us for it. She also gave us a small reimbursement for all the trouble. Half of my family didn't stay because they had an one-year-old and it wasn't safe for her to be there (she kept trying to eat the black stuff off the ground). So we had to pay for a hotel room as it was too late to book any new Airbnb at 10 pm. Check out was a bit difficult as we couldn't find a time to meet and I couldn't drive to her place to drop off the keys, in the end she allowed us to leave it in the house (Website hidden by Airbnb).

**All in all, I would recommend this place to a small group of friends who just want a place to stay and didn't really care much about the above things (and I don't mean that negatively; some people just want to come and sightsee and party in Montreal, and this would be great for them). Maybe also for small families of 4 with kids older than 5. Or two pairs of couples.** Marine was nice to try to accommodate my family of six, but this was just not a good fit.",9.0

"Very beautiful, bright, and welcoming apartment. Roger welcomed us when we got there and gave us our keys. He also offered a quick rundown of events and other activities going on around the city which was very helpful. The apartment was super close to transit which was very convenient and the cafe/diner right at the corner was delicious with great coffee. Parking was very limited and had to be paid for at a rate of $9 for 3 hours at a time, but Roger advised that we could download an app and top up our parking from anywhere. There were no public paid parking lots or garages nearby so plan ahead for where you will park if you bring a vehicle. I would also suggest bringing a fan or two as it was hard to get airflow through the apartment to help with the heat at night. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pots, and pans. The apartment was well staged, clean and adorable! Overall we had a great stay and would definitely recommend!",10.0
"The moment we buzzed in, Roger greeted us with a big “Welcome home!” And that's exactly what this place felt like! It's clean but not so clean that you worry about making any mess. My kids and I felt completely comfortable lounging after a busy day exploring the city. It's got everything you need onsite for a great holiday getaway. The area is fabulous, and we really enjoyed exploring all of the local shops and making the most of our meals.  The evenings were spent sitting on the front balcony watching people walk by. Roger was amazing. We never really needed anything but I knew he was only a text away. This apartment has a lot of character! It's a gem.",10.0

I will definitely be recommending Thanh's apartments in Montreal to any friends who may visit.",9.0
"The apartment is located in a lovely quiet residential area. It's about 10-15 minutes from the Metro, but there are many great restaurants nearby, as well as cafes, shops, grocery stores, and parks. It is the perfect place to enjoy the hip and charming Plateau neighborhood. The spacious first floor apartment is beautifully decorated in a minimal contemporary style. Everything seems to be newly renovated, and it was very clean. The modern kitchen is stylish yet functional with new appliances and nice touches like a bonsai tree on the counter, and a Berkey water filter. There is a large deck off the kitchen that was the perfect spot for breakfast or a glass of wine in the evening. We checked in and out very easily, and the host was responsive if we had questions. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic Montreal experience.",9.0

Just as excellent the second time. Would definitely go back.,9.0
"I booked this based on the location, the reasonable rate, and the onsite parking offered in the listing. The location is great, and the apartment is very nice, but the listing was inaccurate. The host contacted me the night before (!?) we were to arrive with the wrong dates, stating I should book more time, that I would also have to pay extra (over $100 more than the stated price) because my husband was coming, yes, there is onsite parking, but for an additional fee of $25 per day. 

To sum it up, stay true to your original listing, roll your costs into the overall rate, and if you have a contact who meets us on site, give us a map for street parking. Make sure it tells guests they must move their car at 8am (!) on a weekday or face towing, and that street parking is impossible. Also, if you are going to take pictures of our driver's licenses, there better be a good reason other than ""that's what we do."" I have stayed at many Airbnbs, and this was the only one that went sideways.",9.0

"This was probably my best Airbnb experience to date. Cindy and Jeff are outstanding hosts and should already be called Superhosts. From the early check-in to letting me stay a bit late because of my flight delay, I left with two friends with whom I will definitely keep in touch. The exchange of culture, their indescribable hospitality and the feeling of home are only a few things that I have cherished from that trip. Thank you Airbnb for making this experience possible.",10.0

"We were extremely lucky to find this spot one day before Osheaga as our other arrangement cancelled on us last minute. We had a wonderful stay. The loft was spacious, stylish, clean, and the air conditioning was powerful and cooled the entire loft very well. The kitchen was great, with a nice open living space with an island and chairs. The hosts were fantastic communicators. The location in Old Montreal couldn't be better; it was 2 minutes to a 24-hour convenience store, 2 minutes from the subway (which is the best subway system any of us have used). Less than 20 meters from Parc Jean-Drapeau via subway. 24-hour parking was cheap, easy to access, and very close. The rooftop patio was great. Good value. Montreal is probably the nicest major city in Canada. We highly recommend staying here; we would all stay again. Driving home, I'm already thinking about when I can come back to Montreal!",10.0

The host responded quickly and made everything run smoothly.",10.0
"Wedad is a great host and she was so welcoming. 
The place is absolutely worth the money with free healthy breakfast, parking space, and wifi speed had no issue. 
Wedad provided me the best free parking spot right in front of the subway station so that I enjoyed exploring the city by subway with an unlimited weekend pass. 
And she was so flexible and didn't mind me taking a shower late at night which was nice as I came back home after late evening events.",10.0
"Wedad is a charming hostess and very welcoming. Her place borders a riverfront park with walking trails, making it very quiet. It is convenient to public transit.

"A charming house overlooking a park along a river, with shops and public transport nearby, offering calm assurance. We highly recommend Wedad for her hospitality and kindness, always available.",10.0
"Wedad is a great host. Parking and breakfast are very nice amenities that she offers, which are hard to find in a city like Montreal. Street parking can be tricky (you may end up getting a ticket if you don't move the car at the right time). So we felt relieved at her place. If you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown Montreal but still stay in Montreal, then this place is perfect for you. My wife and I did not speak any French, but we had no problems during our conversations with Wehdad. We loved her house especially the sitting area in the living room and the porch overlooking the garden. We had no problems with the stairs in the basement. In fact, the basement was much cooler and quite cozy down there.",10.0
"Excellent welcome, we felt right at home immediately and the pool access was amazing, especially with this heatwave of the weekend.",10.0
"Positive: Beautiful pool, garden and terrace
Neutral: The room is as described in the basement, therefore only moderately ventilated through a small window. Luggage storage in the room not possible, therefore only suitable for a very short stay
Wedad is a communicative host, but house rules should be clarified!",10.0

"Wedad is an exceptional host. Her place is clean and breakfast is great! Wedad's place is close to the walking trail along the river, and she is also very close to public transportation so you can get around the city easily. Wedad is a super conversationalist and knowledgeable about the city and its surroundings. We have stayed there a few times and have always enjoyed it.",10.0
"First and foremost, Superhosts are those who go above and beyond to make a guest's stay pleasant and comfortable. Wedad did just that for me, and I felt like I was actually at home for 11 days. Beyond that, the space is clean and comfortable with enough privacy for anyone who needs it. The amenities are unbeatable because everything I would need in my own home was offered to me.

Some of the perks include the porch and terrace, a pergola, and the heated pool beside it, plus the well-kept yard right next to a green belt that contains gorgeous trails by the river for walking, sitting, or cycling. Also, Wedad is very personable and easy to have a conversation with if that's your thing. The value for the money was excellent!",10.0
"Wedad is a fantastic hostess. She is very warm-hearted and her spacious and tidy house is filled with her warmth and girlish joy.  She has great depth and substance as well. Her house is in a quiet place with lots of nature around, and at the same time close to the bus stops that take you to the center. I stayed two weeks with her and am thankful for that time and I highly recommend staying with Wedad.",10.0

"We had a great time at Mike's place. The location was amazing since the building is just steps away from Cote Saint Catherine street, close to Berri subway station, and in the middle of everything.

"Overall, the place was very nice for my family. My father said the main bedroom had a very comfortable bed. We used a spare mattress in the living room for our kids.  It's really a great place just to sleep; however, the kitchen and dining area are not great spaces or equipped for cooking meals - but the good thing is that it's located close to many restaurants and stores. Amal was a great host and tried to be very accommodating. There were some issues with what was advertised on Airbnb in error. I would say that you definitely need to pay for underground parking as parking is atrocious near the building.",9.0
"The apartment is very well located: two steps from the CHUM and two steps from Latin Quarter. The bed is comfortable and although we are in the city center, everything appears calm and we sleep well.

We will definitely recommend and stay again at Amal's place.",9.0
"Amal must be the most responsive host we've ever had. We never met in person but he provided timely support nonetheless. The location is very good, especially if you are new to Montreal; it's walkable everywhere. One thing to note is that the unit is advertised as 1.5 bathrooms. I understood this to mean one full bathroom and one half bathroom. This was not the case; the unit only has one larger than normal full bathroom. Perhaps there's a difference in American vs. Canadian understanding of 1.5 bathrooms! There's indoor parking FYI for an additional cost, but it's worth it especially in winter.

Conforming to the listing, the house is very well equipped and perfectly suited for young children (high chair, bikes, strollers, bath toys, garden, board games, books etc.). The garden is a real joy. In short, our children were truly delighted and so were we.

"This was our first experience using Airbnb and we were thoroughly satisfied. Caroline welcomed us with an extremely clean house that accurately matched her description on the website. Questions we had prior to arriving were answered quickly by email. She also gave us nice recommendations for restaurants in the area. The Plateau is a wonderful place to stay when in Montreal as you will never go hungry and will always have something fun to do and in walking distance. I would highly recommend staying at their beautifully renovated house and when we return to the area I will be contacting Caroline once again. You also may find a nice surprise in the refrigerator waiting for you. Thank you again for sharing your house with our family.

"This is probably one of the nicest houses you'll stay in. It was spotless, and quite large. The house has everything you could possibly need and is located in a great neighborhood. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

"Location, location, location.  5+ stars. If you are traveling with children do not hesitate to book this house. It is equipped with everything you might need and forgot to pack. The location is fantastic. You can walk to cafes and restaurants easily. There is also a very nice park a short stroll away. Even though it was very close to all the attractions of Le Plateau, the house was very quiet.

The interior of the house is nicely furnished and exceptionally clean.  The bedrooms are set up such that the smaller children's rooms are directly across the hall from the master bedroom. There is also a screened-in sitting/play area off of the master that provided some extra space. The backyard has a perfect little playset and a romantic lighted table and chairs. We picked up takeout for lunch and had a nice quiet break in the afternoon before heading out again to explore further.  We were able to secure parking on the street either directly in front of the house or at most a couple of spots away.

The hosts provided us with some great tips for shopping and dining. They even secured us a reservation at the fantastic restaurant Le Quartier General around the corner. 

This home is a great base for your stay in Montreal. It really is a perfect spot.",10.0

Caroline was an amazing host. She was incredibly responsive and very accommodating. The house is amazing and in a great location for a weekend in Montreal! Couldn't recommend this place more highly.,10.0
"We loved staying here and I can't recommend this place enough!

Located in the best area of Montreal, this place is absolutely huge and has everything one requires for a comfortable and peaceful stay. It is on a residential street so it is nice and quiet, but very close to lots of great shopping, restaurants, parks and beautiful buildings. A short 5-10 minute walk to the Metro.  Being just two of us, it was way more space than we needed...but no complaints about that!

It was wonderful to have a place like this to retire to in the evening after long days of walking around the city. Clean and modern, bright and airy, yet very homey. Very comfortable bed in the master suite with lots of natural light all throughout the entire place.  Beautiful modern bathroom with a lovely tub. I wish I had more time so I could have used it, but the shower was fantastic. Also a cute little powder room on the main level was very convenient. The design and aesthetic were consistently beautiful throughout the entire space, which really added to the peaceful serene ambiance. Absolutely beautiful and well equipped kitchen, looking out over a nice outdoor space with yard and deck. 

Although we did not meet Caroline she was extremely helpful and easy to get in touch with. Checking in and out was incredibly easy, there was lots of information left for us, as well as a bottle of wine, which was immensely appreciated when we arrived.

The only complaint I have is that I was not able to stay there longer, we did not want to leave!  I will definitely keep this place on my list for future trips, it really is the perfect place to stay in Montreal!",10.0
"The house was perfect, just as described! Very clean and welcoming, the owners had left some homemade snacks for us. 

For a family, this property is ideal - 2 children's bedrooms decorated in a very creative way. My 2-year-old daughter was ecstatic, there were no shortage of toys! 

We had a few last minute requests and Caroline and Thierry were very flexible. 

The location is perfect - a haven of peace right in the heart of Plateau. Everything is accessible on foot.

"My group of four friends enjoyed our stay at this beautifully designed home. In the very convenient area of Plateau-Mont Royal, with plenty of shops, restaurants, and the Metro station about 10 minutes walk away. The home is spacious and comfortable. Everything was as presented in the listing and photos; if anything, it was even more impressive in person. The kitchen, as promised, was a great place to cook in.

Caroline was very accessible and welcoming via email before and during our stay, although we did not need to take advantage of her offers to help with reservations or information. Her kind note and complimentary bottle of rose were most appreciated.",10.0

This residence is in one of the best locations in Montreal if you are looking for a true local feel.

For first-time visitors to Montreal, the advice Thierry and Caroline provided was invaluable. Great home base to relax and explore the city.",10.0
"This was our second stay at Caroline and Thierry's home in Montreal. It was exactly perfect for our family. The location is very convenient for walking around the neighborhood. There are many cafes and restaurants in close proximity. The house is well equipped should you choose to eat in. The back garden is a nice spot to relax and enjoy a break from the action. Our children loved having a ""playground"" in the backyard.",10.0
"We loved our Le Plateau house, the perfect size and location for our family of four. Our two kids (ages 8 and 6) loved having the swing set out back, the bunk bed in one room and the trundle bed in the other, plus the toys and books, even in French! We liked having the piano to play on, too.

The kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, and laundry room are all well equipped (as befitting a European-style kitchen, the coffee maker is a French press), and the giant windows facing out back from upstairs and downstairs are fantastic. We appreciated having the gas grill to use out on the deck and the private backyard (though our kids were likely a bit noisy for the backyards all next to one another!).

The location could not be better! The house is on a quiet residential side street in the hip neighborhood of Le Plateau--it felt like French Brooklyn. It's a very short walk to the Mont-Royal metro stop and on the way home from the metro it's easy to stop at the supermarket en route back to the house to pick up whatever you need for dinner. There are also tons of low-key options when it comes to eating out, especially with kids. There are two Second Cup locations within blocks from the house--like a French Canadian Starbucks and our go-to coffee break spot. Also, there are two playgrounds nearby, and one is next to a public pool.

Having the metro nearby was excellent as nearly everything we did was no more than four or five stops away. We drove up via New York State and we were a little nervous about city street parking, but in the summer at least it was always easy to find parking on days you had to move the car for street cleaning. (It is definitely easier than in New York City!)

We so appreciate being able to use this family house as our home for a week and would come back again!",10.0

Clean and very well-located apartment. Communication was easy with the host.,10.0
"This is a very clean and accommodating space. It's nice to be on the top floor because the wood floors squeak. There was only occasional noise from neighbors, which wasn't really bothersome. The sofa bed in the living room is better than a standard pullout sofa but not as good as a decent futon. It's better for kids than for the heavier body of an adult. The location is at the north end of a great stretch of street with lots of restaurants and bakeries. It's nice to be close to a subway. The kitchen has basic supplies, like cutlery and dishes, salt and pepper. There's a great little grocery store a block south. This place provided us great value for our money.",10.0

"Great little spot. The pull-out was confusing at first but Anh was very quick to respond with where the instructions were. There is space for 2-3 cars for free parking on weekends in front, but you have to look between the signs OR there is free parking by the VW dealership a few minutes away. The balcony door locks automatically so be sure not to get locked out. Other than that, great spot. Quite clean. There are two flights of steep stairs to get up, but they're not too bad.

It is a bit noisy as you hear the neighbors and the street, so it's best to sleep in the back bedrooms if you are sensitive to that. The location is great, 5 minutes from the metro station and an ""épicerie"" (small supermarket) and lots of great restaurants around.

Their place is conveniently located in LaSalle close to the waterfront. The home has a contemporary design yet preserves its historic feel. We didn’t have a chance to enjoy their backyard but it truly looked like an oasis with beautiful flowers and a lush garden. 

The room was spacious and had lots of natural light. It was nice to have the bathroom in the bedroom which truly made it feel like our own private suite. Loved the little touches in the room like the phone chargers. 

The highlight of our stay was hands down Marie-Jose’s breakfast! There were homemade muffins on the table, freshly brewed coffee and a selection of teas, a chia yogurt concoction (amazing!), delicious cheese and apple crepes, and home cultivated honey. My mouth is still watering from the breakfast. 

Marie-Jose and Jacques made us feel right at home and part of the family yet we had our space to come and go as we pleased. I honestly can’t wait to book with them again for our next stay in Montreal. Thank you, thank you, thank you Marie-Jose et Jacques - See you soon!",10.0

I can fully recommend it!",10.0

"Yes! The living room in Yaw and Anyele's house is as beautiful in real life as it is in the photograph. Among other surprises that this amiable couple from Ghana have to offer is a full line of personal care products free of charge! This includes a toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash. The cottage is a little small, but there are 2 bathrooms and the kids are well-behaved. The Pierrefonds location is not ideal, but the place is located only a 5 minute walk away from St. Jean's Boul. and the 470 bus. Yaw and Anyele are a glowing example of West Island hospitality.

"Amazing location - great space, very clean and well-kept - easy to get to and check-in. We parked on the street with no problem, but paid parking nearby if you don't get lucky. Mike was very responsive and helpful. Only bummer was smoke (pot or tobacco or incense, not sure which) from a neighbor that seemed to seep into the apartment - it wasn't unbearable or constant, but annoying. We briefly opened windows, but it was very cold outside so we couldn't do that for long. I would, however, stay there again!",10.0

As I was there for an extended period of time, I would have liked more cooking utensils, but this is perfect for a short-term stay. Thanks again, Mike!",10.0

"Charming and pleasant apartment to live in. It is ideally located in Montreal with or without a car! You can park without too much trouble, or explore the Mile End or Plateau on foot. Alphee's hospitality is truly very friendly. We enjoyed his aromatic herbs from his little garden. With our two children, we felt like home. I highly recommend this accommodation without hesitation.",10.0
"We cannot say enough good things about Alphee's beautiful apartment. Bright, clean, modern and well located near many great restaurants, markets and parks. The apartment is equipped with fabulous touches such as a huge jetted tub, a high quality music system, an espresso machine, and excellent AC - a rarity in Montreal! The back garden is a lush oasis to relax in and enjoy an al fresco meal. The surrounding neighbors are friendly yet give plenty of privacy.

Alphee was very responsive, nice, and easy to communicate with. She made our entire family, including our children, feel welcomed into her lovely home. We would stay there again without hesitation. Thank you so much for your hospitality, Alphee!",10.0

"My family visits Montreal every year, and I can honestly say that Alphee's home is the best we have stayed in Montreal partly due to the fact that we truly felt at home. I came to find that we share similar interests (such as our love for plants!) and a healthy, balanced lifestyle. Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful space with us. We can only hope to stay in your home again when we visit next year and finally meet you and your sweet daughter!",10.0

They didn't hesitate to welcome me directly. The cleaning was done perfectly despite the lack of time. I thank them for their professionalism :)

The apartment is really great, close to Lafontaine Park. We feel very good there.",9.0
Pleasant apartment in a good location. Olivier is a responsive and attentive host.,9.0
"Very beautiful apartment, well maintained! The decor is absolutely amazing! Communication has always been A1! Although the metro isn't right next door, we haven't had any trouble with transportation. The only thing that could be improved is the WiFi connection. Not the fastest, which prevented us from having a relaxing Netflix night, but we enjoyed ourselves otherwise :-) We highly recommend it!!!!",9.0
"I spent three nights in this apartment and liked it very much. 

The location is near a big park, and it took me about 15 minutes to walk to the nearest metro station. A supermarket can be reached by a short 3-minute walk.

Entrance to the apartment is from a street level door, and the apartment is one floor up, reached by a staircase inside the building.

The apartment itself felt a bit like home. The wooden floors are creaky and a little worn in places, but not a problem at all, at least for me. There are also a few minor drops of paint on the floors, but again, not really a problem. The furniture is generally comfortable and the bedroom mattress is relatively firm. I really appreciated the light-blocking curtains and blinds in the bedroom. I was not bothered by traffic noise from the street during my stay, and found the place quiet. What I also really appreciated about this apartment is how clean it was: Absolutely spotless! Also, communication with my host was flawless! Needed a hairdryer and got a reply immediately. And the hairdryer was delivered very soon after. And I got the same fast response and delivery when I couldn't find a can opener.

All in all, I was very glad to stay in this apartment and impressed by my host's swift and positive replies to my requests. 

I would be happy to stay in this apartment again the next time I visit Montreal.",9.0

The apartment is cute, warm, clean - I would stay there again! I had a few questions before my arrival and during my stay and he replied immediately. Such a great find!!! Thank you.",9.0
Olivier's place is very quiet and it is easy to find free parking. The only thing I wish it had was a washer/dryer.,9.0
"We stayed at Olivier's apartment to celebrate NYE in Montreal for about 5 days and it was perfect for my husband and me. We are from SoCal so we never get the cold temperatures that Montreal has, so it was really nice that Olivier provided the apartment with what it needed to stay cozy. The location was great too, pretty close to Schwartz's which we ate at like three times. Communication was great and Olivier was always quick to respond. Thanks for letting us celebrate 2019 at your Plateau place.",9.0
"I was stuck at Olivier's place for 15 days: from February 16th to March 1st. This stay was a disaster, getting worse each day. Olivier's apartment is not at all suitable for winter. As soon as the temperatures dropped, there was no heating: 16 degrees inside while it needed -20 outside!!! To summarize my adventures, besides these 15 days spent in the cold (which is already unbearable): A trap on the ceiling was open to the exterior, the curtains in the bedroom fell down, the shower leaked, and the TV didn't work... In short, a stay of the most catastrophic kind. I had asked to leave sooner, but Olivier did not want to, despite the circumstances, reimburse me. A very bad experience, I do not recommend him!",9.0
Great location and fully equipped! Perfectly clean! Overall great stay!,10.0

"Carlos and Lucien are excellent hosts, kind and respectful who went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. My wife and I came to live in Montreal and they were very helpful for us. The apartment is clean, spacious, and well-lit. The same goes for the room, where we felt very comfortable considering it was a 16-night stay. The common areas are beautiful and comfortable. The accommodation is located near a metro station, and other tourist attractions such as the botanical garden, Olympic park, and Montreal Tower. Highly recommended.",9.0
"Staying in Carlo's apartment was an unforgettable experience. It is beautiful, very comfortable, and conveniently located. We loved everything about it. Carlo is amazing host, welcoming and very helpful. So, this is a great place. Economical and excellent for the savvy traveler. The internet was very fast and the overview from the terrace was great. Thank you!!",9.0
"A very clean and beautiful place with exceptional views! However, I thought it was a whole apartment, the title misled me a little.  

The only other point is that I found it a bit complicated to get there for the first time! 

Despite all of this, I believe it's a good quality place and very clean! A great place!",9.0
"""My friend and I spent one week at Carlos's apartment. It exceeded our expectations. The hospitality of Carlos and his partner was wonderful. The apartment was super clean, spacious with amazing views, especially during sunrise or sunset. I was looking for a 5-star hotel to relax for at least two nights. But I was blessed to spend a week relaxing in this 5-star luxurious apartment for a lower price.""

"I wish I had spent a little more money and gone to a motel because this was an absolute nightmare of a house. There was dirt literally everywhere and it looked like the common areas, bathroom, and room hadn't been swept in ages. The bathroom had grime and hair on the sink, floor, and in the bathtub. The room was supposed to be two queen beds but instead was one twin and one queen and was super cramped and uncomfortable. The room was also supposed to have a ""view"" according to the listing but all we saw were the neighbors' backyard as well as a huge pile of random trash. The soap dispenser in the bathroom had soap so diluted with water that we ended up using hand sanitizer to clean our hands. The listing also said it was close to downtown but it ended up being a 45-1 hour trip to downtown one way (bus and then train), and it was super inaccessible. Overall I’m really disappointed because the listing looked lovely and instead it ended up being super gross and really uncomfortable for all of us. Additionally there were a ton of people there and the lock on the door for our room was super broken down and could easily have been opened. I’m also pretty sure that mold/dust in the house is the reason my friend got sick the first night we were there. 

I have stayed in cheaper places that have been nicer than this and it was so awful to have this trip ruined for us. Our friend group was meeting for the first time in over 8 months and it was such a let down as the host seemed really nice and down to earth. We definitely learned our lesson to do more research and to plan further in advance to book a better place for New Years in the future.",2.0

There is an IGA right around the corner which was convenient for grocery shopping and beer. The place was very clean, a comfy bed with balconies on both rooms.

"We had a nice stay at Melanie's Airbnb. The place was clean and well decorated. The electronic keypad for the door is very convenient as you can check in and out whenever you please. The place is fully equipped with everything you need if you want to cook or do laundry. My only complaint is that it takes roughly an hour to walk to downtown, or it will take 40 minutes by public transport. It's roughly a 12-minute drive by taxi or Uber to Old Port. We ended up taking an Uber every day. I wouldn't say the Airbnb is in the ""heart"" of Montreal. It's also a $45 cab ride to the airport. All that to say, for three bedrooms, it's a great deal.",10.0

"Pros: amazing location, super comfortable beds, very clean, thoughtful Nespresso machine and all the kitchen supplies you need, great space to hang out in, easy check-in, friendly staff. Perfect location in Old Montreal with tons of great places to eat and hang out nearby. 

Cons: We booked room 402 but were checked into 304, ultimately it was fine but we had specifically planned some events/gatherings based on the room that was pictured (i.e., a big table for a nice dinner, lots of couches and chairs for movie night), so we had to adjust a bit. 

There was also a door in one of the bedrooms that led right into a hallway where people were often loud when checking out early in the morning or kids playing in the hall. The windows downstairs were also drafty, which isn't ideal for a Montreal winter. 

All manageable, but just little things we had to work around.",10.0

"The check-in process was less than ideal. I was told to go to someone's apartment (not the host) to pick up the keys. When we arrived at the Airbnb location, we had a very difficult time finding parking despite the host telling us that there is plenty of free parking available. The building itself was under heavy construction (wires hanging down from the ceiling in the lobby, clutter in the hallways, etc...). The unit's floors were dirty including in the bathroom, the bedsheets were stained, we found hair in bedding, the heat was very high with no way to control the temperature, and one of the kitchen cabinet doors came off entirely when opened. The mattresses could barely even be called mattresses as they were extremely uncomfortable with minimal support. The pillows were as flat as possible (either very poor quality or extremely old). Needless to say, we did not enjoy our stay despite the host's ""Superhost"" status. We will not stay with this host again.",8.0

"Thanks Moss and Yan for a clean and comfortable stay at your Airbnb. Your stylish home is sure to be the desired reservation for many other young adults in the future. Some things to note could be the somewhat unstable toilet and shower door that does not close fully. Please also note that despite the wonderfully new TV, there was no audio output. Overall, a great stay and would be happy to return. The location is also very convenient and close to a bank, grocery store, and parking lot. Great small home for groups of 4, clean and modern, and reasonably priced.",9.0

"Ultra well-placed colocation, yet well-organized. The accommodation is top-notch in terms of the shared living space. The apartment is very functional, with a bright and spacious bedroom. I had a key set and was completely free to make trips back and forth. On the last day, I even managed to leave my luggage later than planned. Highly recommended!",10.0
"Ayca was a gracious and generous host, she offers airport pickup for a small fee which was most convenient. 

The room is spacious with a large queen-sized bed, plenty of closet space, and lovely lighting.

You have your own bathroom (!) and overall the house meets the description very well.

She is an amazing woman, their daughter is lovely, they have a calm and cute (non-shedding) white dog. The house is kept very clean and Ayca even offered me breakfast on both days.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Almost more like traveling to a good friend's home with warm hospitality and kindness. We became great friends and will be sure to keep in touch. 

As a single woman I was very pleased with the safety of the neighborhood; not to mention the West Island area is beautiful and there is a bus connection to downtown as well. 

Highly recommend!",10.0

"The location was not good. The hallways had a strong smell of urine throughout, and the entire building felt sketchy. I called the host 15 times before she finally messaged me on Airbnb.

Someone tried to get into the apartment using a code at 10 am, which made me feel unsafe.",8.0

Nice clean place in a good location for downtown Montreal. Very relaxing place and nicely decorated. Underground parking is very narrow if you plan on driving/renting a spot.

And the floor-to-ceiling windows were wonderful to overlook the city on a nice snowy day. We woke up every morning and made coffee using their espresso machine.

"Melanie and her roommate, Alex, were friendly, thoughtful, and kind hosts. Just wonderful. Both took time to help orient us to the apartment, neighborhood, and city, and were available in case we had any additional questions. They were also generous and flexible with our schedules and graciously shared the apartment's amenities such as the washer/dryer and dishwasher. We can't thank Melanie & Alex enough for the experience of having our own, quiet and homey, pied-à-terre while visiting Montréal. We felt like welcome guests rather than clients.

Melanie's apartment is charming and has an excellent view of the city and the Plateau from the relaxing rooftop garden, which is a delicious bit of private luxury before or after a day out in the city. It's close to streets that conveniently connect to nearby East & West neighborhoods via rue Mont-Royale and rue Sherbrooke. (A Bixi bike station off Mont-Royale is likewise convenient.) Yet it's in a small neighborhood that also has restaurants, grocers, shopping and nightlife in it's own right, and is conveniently near green areas, such as Parc La Fontaine, Place Laurier, the Olympic Park, and the parks on Île St. Hélèn via la Pont Jacques Cartier, which one can walk or bike across. (The view of the St. Lawrence & the city from this bridge is worth it alone.)

In short, Melanie's apartment is wonderful and in a perfect location to experience the best of Montréal. 

I hope you also get to experience the good life from this perspective! 

Thank you again, Melanie and Alex! Wishing you both the best!

"Melanie was very welcoming throughout the trip and told us about some of her favorite places to go. She let us drop off our bags and explore the city while she got the place ready for us. The description of the place is very accurate and the entire place feels homey.  The neighborhood is peaceful and there are a ton of restaurants, shops, bars, and places to buy alcohol. The metro subway station is also very close by. The private roof terrace is absolutely amazing and I can definitely say that we spent most of our time outside on it. I miss this place already!",10.0

Thank you, Melanie!",10.0
"We had a really fantastic stay at Melanie's apartment. The apartment is big and comfortable. There is everything you may need in the kitchen (and even more!) and this rooftop terrace (with a view of Mont Royal Park and Downtown Montreal) is just exclusive. After a 20km walk during the day, you'll loooove having a Belle Gueule beer on the terrace :-p

Concerning the neighborhood, Le Plateau is a trendy and hipster place, calm and typical with many restaurants, but be careful it may be a bit far from Downtown (the metro Mont Royal is a 5-minute walk from Melanie's apt).

Moreover, we actually reserved the room at the very last minute and arrived very late, but Melanie was very accessible on the Airbnb app and we didn't have any difficulties getting the keys. Take it easy and enjoy your stay at Melanie's apt!",10.0

Melanie was responsive to our questions. The condo isn't air conditioned but is nice and airy and we had a comfortable stay through four of the hottest days of summer so far.",10.0
"Melanie's apartment is located in a great section of the Plateau and easily walkable to a lot of shopping, stores, restaurants, and the metro. The roof deck is phenomenal, and in my opinion, is what sets this listing apart. You will certainly want to spend your evenings out there, and if you like to cook, plan to have some dinners up there too! We also didn't have any issue finding parking around the corner, which was a plus. Two recommendations - Le Pegase is around the corner and is BYOB, and Les Co'Pains d'Abord has phenomenal croissants in the morning for breakfast.

One caveat, as others mentioned, is that the apartment is not air conditioned. This is not that big of a deal during the day, but the bedroom does not have a portable AC unit either, and that made sleeping quite difficult all three nights. The only way that we could sleep was with the windows wide open, but that let all the light and noise from busy Ave Papineau into the room, and it was still pretty hot at that. The second bedroom is dark but has no windows to open and thus was too hot. We also only had one fan, which did not serve to cool down the room enough. I imagine that this is not an issue in the fall and spring, which are probably the best times to rent this apartment since you will still be able to use the roof deck but will also be able to keep the windows closed at night. Also please note that when we were there it was swelteringly hot, with nights in the upper 70s and high humidity. I imagine that cool summer nights may not be too bad either. We did know about the lack of AC when we rented the apartment, so it wasn't like Melanie was not honest, but if you don't like humidity or light/noise when you sleep, you may want to wait until the fall or spring to book this place.",10.0

It's incredibly close to all amenities while still being incredibly quiet and comfortable. A quick (10-minute) walk to the metro made traveling around the city a breeze! Very much worth the value. We loved it. 

The only thing I would say to be aware of is parking. As the listing says, it's completely restricted from 4-6pm for rush hour. But there's also another restriction of 60-minute stays between 9am and 4pm. There was parking available on a side street, so we didn't end up leaving our car there as we noticed the parking authority out and we didn't really want a ticket.",10.0

HDMI only for TV use. Full internet access. Overall a great experience. Thanks a lot Mel!",10.0

Those who might not like stairs too much may have a hard time, but the location and features were great!

Lots of restaurants, shops and boulangeries are nearby. Mont Royal metro station is <10 min walk away, or a few mins by bus. 

Melanie was amazing - she offered lots of helpful info and advice for our stay and trip. She was very communicative and quick to respond to any of our inquiries. Thanks for a lovely stay, Melanie! If ever we are in Montreal again and you're still an Airbnb host, we will certainly look you up! Merci beaucoup!",10.0

The rooftop is awesome! 
Just a small point of improvement, the sofa was unfortunately very dirty...  It would be ideal to change it or put covers on to cover the cushions.

I just didn’t realize (my own lack of research) that the home is quite far from many of the attractions I had planned to visit, but my friend and I walked each way a couple times and then took a quick 15-minute subway ride as well.

"Melanie was an excellent host. She made check-in and check-out so easy! She was also very quick to respond to my messages.

The space is great for a weekend visit. The apartment was clean, with the exception of the bathroom, which could have used a nice scrub with CLR mold and mildew remover. The shower is also very tiny; it was a little claustrophobic. 

The bedrooms were comfortable and clean. Although the bedroom facing the street has sheer curtains, so if you like to sleep in, bring an eye mask to block the light.

The kitchen had all the essentials and was clean.

The apartment is actually a 25-minute walk from the metro. A little inconvenient when the weather is bad. But it's a quick Uber ride.

The location is great. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. The liquor store and 24-hour grocery were two minutes away. There was also a dollar store right there, so if you forgot your toothbrush or any small item, it's no hassle to get them. 

If you want to be close to nightlife and attractions, it is a little far removed.

Overall, very happy with the apartment and would love to stay there again in the summer to take advantage of the rooftop terrace.",10.0

The metro station was about a 15-20 minute walk away, taking you straight into the city, but the buses were also great, as the apartment is right on an interchange. I would recommend the apartment as a good base.",10.0

Melanie's place was great. Check-in was easy. It was in a great location and parking was super easy. Melanie gave us great recommendations for places to eat and it was easy to fill out the weekend with activities around Montreal.

"Annie's communication prior to our stay was thorough and thoughtful. We had cell phone numbers and names of two contacts who could welcome us on our day of arrival. This was very helpful since the time needed to pass through the border between the USA and Canada can be unpredictable. Our welcome contact showed us around the apartment, introduced us to Momo, and was very friendly. She even walked us to the nearby street where we would find restaurant choices because eating was our priority at that moment!

Freshly ground coffee, a French Press, and many bright and beautiful colors both inside and out from painted walls, kitchenware, and blooming flowers welcomed us in the morning. The deck felt soft underfoot, and the privacy of the backyard extended the kitchen in an organic way. The pool was refreshing and soothing to view. The entire space was aesthetically pleasing.

At night we slept well. All was quiet. The shower worked well. The coming and going was easy and gentle.",9.0
"We had a pleasant stay at Annie's place. The accommodation was very well-arranged and very close to the metro, which is really appreciated, especially since we were traveling with three children. The courtyard was nice, and we enjoyed it as well as the barbecue! We didn't miss anything!",9.0
"We enjoyed our stay at Annie's condo very much. It is centrally located, has a lovely garden and pool, and all the amenities we needed from towels to pots and pans. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, close to the Jean Talon Market and a little park for our son to play in. 
Annie was helpful in answering any questions we had; we are sorry we never got to meet her. 
Momo is a friendly cat who always let us know if he needed to get in or out.",9.0

The pool and backyard were charming, and the neighborhood itself had everything we needed. I've stayed in downtown Montreal in the past, but prefer this neighborhood. The flat was spacious - the four of us never felt like we were on top of each other. Annie was helpful and responsive even though she was on vacation herself. Great stay!",9.0
Lovely apartment located in a very trendy neighborhood. Great restaurants and shops.,9.0
"We have stayed at a few places on AirBnB and Annie's was great. Eclectic with a touch of old world feel, you will love the flow into the back yard, the proximity to the Metro and Little Italy. 

Everything you need is so close. The neighborhood is very interesting and represents a part of Montreal that should be embraced.

Annie was a great host - she took the time to make sure we felt at home!",9.0

"The house is really very charming with a small garden and a beautiful terrace that we have enjoyed greatly. The bedroom and office/bedroom are spacious but in the half basement, which is quite common in Montreal but may surprise French people who are used to it. 

It's a co-living situation with several local roommates,  friendly for exchanges but this does require some discretion.

"Don't be discouraged by the outside of the building. Geneva has a charming apartment with nice furniture pieces. She was out of town when we arrived but answered questions quickly. In fact, when we were there she had been away for a while and had had some Airbnb guests staying, so the apartment wasn't as clean as you might want. We liked the neighborhood and the great cafes nearby. The Korean restaurant was nice.",9.0

"Geneva’s place was definitely our favorite Airbnb in Montreal. It's in an older building and has a nice quaint, classic feel to it: natural light, wood floors, some neat plants in the kitchen, and a perfect layout. There's a small back porch with a fantastic view of the alley behind the house, which was covered in plants, vines, and people enjoying the air on their decks. The Mile End area was such a lively, picturesque place.

Geneva was friendly, helpful, and spoke fluent English (and Spanish!). We enjoyed our stay!",9.0

"The perfect place in the perfect location of downtown Montreal. The online pictures match the spacious loft apartment, and my room was ready with fresh sheets and bath towels.

There is no better location for jazz fest, and we walked everywhere from this very central location.",10.0
"A great place to stay, with a fantastic location and very welcoming and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.",10.0
"A great place full of unique furniture and art. I found it to be a productive writing space and ended up getting a lot of work done in the communal areas while I was there. Everyone living there was respectful of my space and delightful to talk to on occasion. My room was super quiet, practically soundproof, which is nice. The neighborhood is close to several train and bus lines that connect to other parts of the city, right in the heart of downtown, which was very convenient for me.",10.0
"My stay at Pauline's and Thomas's place was very pleasant. Their spacious and sun-filled loft is full of character and charm. I was allowed to fully use their kitchen, washer & dryer and got a fan in my room which was pleasant after a warm day. Pauline and Thomas are nice people that are easy to get along with and are very warm. 

Conveniently located close to old town and the Palais de Congres, one can also easily go grocery shopping and quickly reach Ste-Catherine and the Arts district around UQAM.

I'll be happy to stay at their place again.",10.0
"I stayed about two weeks in this awesome loft and I can totally recommend it! Thomas, Pauline & Ben were very nice and helpful and the loft looks even better than in the photos! Not to forget Couscous, probably the cutest cat I ever met. Thank you!",10.0
"Pauline and Thomas were very friendly, gracious, and hospitable hosts during my stay, and it was a pleasure getting to know them and their fellow roommate Benoit. It's important to note that Pauline was very accommodating to my arrival schedule and had a high degree of organization, which I appreciated greatly, given the much different experience I had earlier with a neighboring hotel. The loft was much larger than I expected and situated perfectly within reach of Montreal's major points of interest. Cous Cous was probably the most chill and relaxed cat I've ever seen. I'd most certainly recommend the experience to anyone, including my own return visit to Montreal.",10.0
"I stayed at this place for 3 weeks. Pauline and Thomas (and also roommate Ben) were very friendly and hospitable. They have a unique and gorgeous loft, which they have furnished and decorated in their own artistic styles. The place has a huge living area and a kitchen - and the bedroom was quite cozy as well. The location of the place is very convenient with metro and grocery shops close by. Cous Cous and Sid are probably the most relaxed and friendly cats I have ever seen, who I guess have learned a thing or two about hospitality from their owners :-) Overall I had a wonderful time in this charming loft and I would definitely stay here again.",10.0

Super loft with vintage decor!!! :),10.0
"Couldn't have chosen a better place to stay in Montreal. Pauline was so kind and considerate. The space was so clean, homey and cozy. The suite had tons of natural light. Couscous was the sweetest cat we've ever met. Pauline has a very impressive plant collection. The location was perfect for all the sights we wanted to see. There were restaurants, galleries, bixi stations and the metro nearby. We would definitely recommend staying here on your trip to Montreal. Thanks Pauline!",10.0
"Pauline's place is perfect for staying one or two people, the bed and the room are cozy and comfortable. The rest of the apartment, which is shared, is beautiful and clean. The location cannot be better. Everything was as expected and Pauline is such a great host; I had to make a last-minute change and we agreed immediately, she was comprehensive and nice. So I recommend this place.",10.0

"Marie's 2-bedroom apartment in the Plateau was perfect for our stay. Great location, both to the Metro and to Mont-Royal, with everything you needed within walking distance. Although Marie and I missed the chance to meet face-to-face due to our schedules, we worked around it and made arrangements for keys, etc. She left us a great ""cheat sheet"" for the apartment and what to do in the neighborhood that was very helpful, as well as an amazing spread of continental goodies (croissants, fruit, coffee, and the like). It was very much a hotel-like stay with all the comforts of home. Marie stayed in touch via text/email throughout our visit to ensure everything was in order. Overall, a very pleasant experience! Thank you, Marie!",9.0

The best thing about this apartment? The espresso machine. We're going to have to buy one of our own now.",9.0

"Wonderful 6-night stay in Marie's cozy Mont Royal neighborhood apartment during our epic Women's World Cup trip to Canada.  Marie is very responsive and helpful; although we did not meet her, she was very personable via email and text.  The apartment is IDEAL for an active couple or family.  The walkup apartment is close to Parc Mont Royal for a hike or challenging run, and within a short walk of 3 Bixi bike stations (the best way to see Montreal is by bike; we took the Bixi everywhere, day and night, to Biosphere, Jazz Festival, Stadium de Montreal for World Cup).  Also close to the metro and bus to Airport.  Marie was very attentive in leaving information on the Montreal Jazz Festival.  We enjoyed the festival thoroughly, and were able to get tickets to see John Mayall, a lifelong dream for myself and my spouse.  The apartment was exactly as pictured, kitchen well-equipped (I cooked for us one night) and walkable to very hip area of bars, cafes, and restaurants.  The Netflix worked great to stream (Canada has a lot more content available than the USA), and Marie's internet was fast.  Our second trip to Montreal, and quite enjoyed staying there. It was a very good value as well. Thanks Marie, you are a wonderful hostess!

It is a 10-minute walk to Mont Royal metro station.",9.0
"Marie was very quick to respond to any questions, and went above and beyond in making our stay comfortable. My wife and I visited Montreal with our 18-month-old daughter, and the apartment was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The location was very convenient with easy walking to several parks, grocery stores, and the Metro. Marie provided us with a map of nearby parks and plug covers for all the outlets. The AC was necessary during a heat wave, but was able to keep the whole place comfortable. I would highly recommend this apartment and would look to book again for a return trip.",9.0
"Staying at Simon and Erika's apartment for a week was our best Airbnb experience yet! Their home is a beautiful gem. Gorgeous, clean, comfortable, inviting, interesting, accommodating—staying here was everything one could ask for in a vacation space. They left us informative instructions, great recommendations to the neighborhood, and were easy to contact during our stay. Rosemont is a great little neighborhood; it had an excellent bakery and every basic amenity nearby. Despite being further East, it's only a quick bus ride away from two different metro lines. Would love to stay here again!",10.0

"A big thank you to Anouchka!

Very kind and very thoughtful, Anouchka sent us an email before we left to make sure we knew how to get to her apartment. She even offered to wait at the metro station for us to pick her up. She gave us the keys in person and showed us around her apartment. She even planned to leave us everything we needed for breakfast the next morning, which is appreciated when you arrive in the evening. The next day, she sent us a text message to see how our first night went and asked if we needed anything to perfect our stay. The accommodation is very warm, exactly as it appears in the photos, clean and very welcoming. We feel very good there! We won't hesitate to ask Anouchka to let us stay again during our next visit to Montreal! The neighborhood is very pleasant and the proximity of the metro is very convenient. Thank you again, Anouchka, and see you soon!",10.0
"Anouchka's wonderful apartment is really a home away from home. Bright, colorful, full of natural sunlight and fully equipped with everything you need to make your stay in Montreal incredibly enjoyable.

"I always feel cozy and comfortable at the Airbnbs I stay in, but there was something about Anouchka's that really made me feel like I was at home, like no other time has. My boyfriend and I took the train up from NYC, and I was planning on updating Anouchka on our arrival time using the wifi on the train-- since we got transferred to a bus in Albany, I had no way of contacting her once we crossed the Canadian border. I was so worried, since the unexpected change caused us to arrive later than expected-- but Anouchka was completely prepared to handle every situation and left the keys for us in a convenient place even though we weren't able to meet her as planned. Nothing beat waking up in that beautiful, warm, comfortable haven each morning and seeing the snowfall outside. Thank you, Anouchka, for giving us the perfect home during our short but memorable stay in Montreal!",10.0
"Anouchka met us at the apartment as planned. She is a very gracious host and made us feel welcome. All of our questions about the neighborhood were answered in a notebook complete with maps. The apartment was clean and well-equipped.

"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. The bed was good with nice linens. The apartment was decorated in nice colors - bright and cheerful! The kitchen was equipped and the bathroom had good water pressure. The book left in the apartment described a bunch of places to check out - came in handy as we visited a local bakery and coffee shop (really nice). The neighborhood is classic Montreal. Tree-lined streets with three-story walk-ups. Very close to Jarry metro and Jarry Park. There are lots of local shops nearby, including grocery stores and pharmacies. We had no trouble finding street parking. I always travel with a sleep mask and it came in handy as the apartment is nice and bright, and the curtains in the bedroom let light come in. If you're there in the summer months and have the windows open, there's a bit of street noise, not too much but a little. This wouldn't apply in the cooler months when the windows are closed. Overall, I recommend this apartment - it's very clean and quaint, and the neighborhood is classic Montreal and close to the metro with easy street parking nearby!",10.0
"Our arrival was well prepared by Anouchka, thank you to her! She has been very available, responsive, and friendly. She also prepared a folder with practical information for our stay. 

The apartment is well located, a metro station within walking distance, then easy access to the city center. 

In the end, good value for money!",10.0
"Anouchka's apartment is an oasis! It is absolutely warm and cozy, and also very peaceful and relaxing. We weren't sure where to look for places to stay in Montreal. In fact, we only picked Anouchka's apartment because of the great pictures and glowing reviews -- we had no idea where it was in relation to attractions/restaurants/etc. I'm glad we chose this place to stay!

Anouchka left a great traveler's guide complete with suggestions of where to go in her neighborhood. The neighborhood is not in Old Montreal -- you need to take the metro which is located right down the street. I found the location to be perfect. Good restaurants and cafes; tree-lined streets and cool looking apartments; a great bar with local craft beer; etc. There is also a great balcony off the kitchen where you can enjoy breakfast or a book or a drink. The neighborhood was quiet when we were there, and even with a party going on downstairs, I couldn't hear them at all when I went to bed. 

Anouchka's apartment is incredibly clean. The decor is bright and cheery (I loved all the plants!). The bedroom is huge. The bathroom is huge. The sitting room is cozy with a nice, big couch. The kitchen is full-sized. It felt like home!  The pictures here on Airbnb are a great representation of this apartment.

Thank you for opening up your home to us! We truly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this flat to anyone!",10.0

"The apartment matched the ad description. It was clean, comfortable, bright, colorful, and seemed to convey a sense of the host (whom we did not meet this trip, but spoke with on the phone). The arrival arrangements were as promised, even though we arrived later than anticipated. Having a washer and dryer in the apartment was great. The weather was hot and humid, but there was a rotating fan in the apartment that helped a great deal in that regard. We felt comfortable while there and were able to enjoy coffee on the terrace in the mornings (at least when it wasn't raining).

The neighborhood matched other reviewers' descriptions—quiet, residential, diverse. A short walk to Jarry Street presented a variety of dining, coffee, and drink options. There were several Vietnamese restaurants, Greek, Italian, and a couple of bars. We returned again and again to EtOH, which was on Jarry and St-Denis, as they had twenty craft beers on tap and good pub food. Java Mythe, marked in Anouchka's Traveller's Guide, which she placed in the apartment, had excellent coffee. A bit of a walk first thing in the morning, but worth it. A walk to Parc Jarry turned up a free concert on Friday evening; and over on Villeray we were able to get our poutine fix at Frites Alors. The subway, also on Jarry, was a short walk, and between that, our feet, and the 193 and 30 buses, we were able to go anywhere we wanted without having to touch the car for five days.

"Anouchka's apartment was wonderful. Bright, exceptionally clean, and everything the pictures portrayed it to be. We were able to relax, and she was always prompt with responding anytime we needed something. We would recommend this place to anyone.",10.0
"Anouchka offers a very friendly and thoughtful experience for travelers. She maintained contact with us before we arrived, made sure we were clear about how to enter the apartment, and left many interesting maps and brochures about the area. She also created a neighborhood map that pointed out various locations for meals and shopping. The apartment is very clean, and super energetic and colorful. The kitchen is well stocked with necessary items and allows for comfortable meals and socializing. The rest of the apartment offers comfort amidst a creative décor. There are many lighting options, which is nice when you just want to hang out or relax. The little porch provided a great place to find fresh air while sipping on drinks or reading a book. The surrounding area, while further away from the hub of Le Plateau or Downtown Montreal, provides quick access to the Jean Talon market --- an amazing must-see place --- and the #30 bus which can transport one to more bustling areas rather quickly. For the past decade or so, we have tended to stay in the Le Plateau region, and were a little worried about being so far out. But in the end, this was an amazing choice because we explored the Villeray/St Michel area, as well as Mile End, places we had ignored in previous visits to Montreal. As a result of the switch, we found great bagel and gift shops in Mile End, and appreciated a week-long supply of fresh berries and veggies from the Jean Talon market. When we wanted to go out for dinner or to a museum, we found the bus (with a stop just on the corner) to be incredibly convenient, and the metro a short and interesting walk away. We did not get a chance to explore the restaurants in the immediate area, although there are many. For us, being able to spread out, to relax, and to savor foods prepared at home was a real treat, which was made even more incredible by Anouchka’s decorating talent. We hope to return next year for a longer stay, and will definitely first look to see if this apartment is available. I am now a huge fan of Airbnb and Anouchka’s hospitality!",10.0
"Great stay! Comfortable apartment with character and not too far from the sights. Anouchka left a book full of neighborhood tips and useful information.

"I had an amazing time in Montreal anchored by Anouchka's beautiful apartment. I found her apartment spacious, colorful, and inspiring with two balconies and it was situated close to Jarry station, which was one stop away from beautiful Jean Talon & Little Italy. Getting downtown and to Old Montreal was also a short ride away. Anouchka was a wonderful host; when I arrived she had a booklet with suggestions about the neighborhood, apartment rules, and even maps and tour guide pamphlets about the city.

"The apartment is just as it appears in the photos. My room was the smaller one, and had a twin bed. The mattress was hard, but quite comfortable, I slept very well. The rooms works for a small person, but could not accommodate two people. Everything was clean and in good shape, almost like a hotel room. The kitchen has a fridge, so you can leave your food there. It is not a room in someone's apartment, it is a room in a rental flat - something to consider. You have a lot of privacy, but don't get to interact with the hosts much. Grace and Irwin are kind and helpful, provided with everything I needed, and waited for me to arrive although it was quite late. They were quick to respond when I was there and whenever I needed anything. I used the washer and dryer - all worked perfectly.


The neighborhood is great! The metro is across the street, there is a convenience store in front of the apartment, a supermarket 5 minutes away, plenty of restaurants less than 5 minutes away. Very safe. The arts museum is less than 10 minute walk away. You can walk to a lot of places or take the metro when you are tired. Great location, very convenient.",9.0
"I rented this apartment for one of my IT consultants for about three weeks with the intention of him returning a month later for another two to three-month stay and he absolutely loved the place so much that I had to rebook the same place before he even checked out to make sure he would get back the same place. He refused to stay anywhere else. Not only were the accommodations satisfactory, but Grace, the host, is a doll! She makes sure you're comfortable, warm and the apartment is always clean! Honestly, I can't think of one thing that my consultant complained about; he loved everything, he gave his stay a 10/10.

Thank you",9.0
"Grace and Irwin were terrific hosts. I shared a room in an apartment, but the other tenant was quiet and worked long hours, so it worked out.

It was big enough for my short two-day stay. The 3rd floor had two separate bedrooms that allowed us to share the kitchen area. The neighborhood was a great location with restaurants, coffee shops, the arts, and the Jazz Festival. It was a great and safe location. I booked on short notice so it worked out great. Thanks, Grace & Irwin!

"I had the opportunity to stay at Grace and Irwin's condo; this was my first time using Airbnb services and I was very pleased. Grace is a wonderful lady, and I spent a few minutes with her drinking tea. I wasn't feeling well with a bad cold, and she made sure I had some of her special delicious jasmine tea. Their son is a wonderful young man who also invited me for a cup of tea while Grace and Irwin were out. The place was impeccably clean and comfortable, close to the nicest areas of Montreal on Maisonneuve Road and St. Catherine Road just behind the condo, with many many restaurants nearby. Easy access to the metro and walking distance to downtown Montreal. The place is full of life surrounded by young kids from Concordia University, McGill University, and Montreal. Overall, a wonderful experience.",9.0
"I arrived a little later than I thought, which was good because the room wasn't quite ready. However, the room was just as described. It was nice, small, and the en-suite bathroom was good enough for one person's stay. Comfortable! And cool after a day's excursion. Grace was very kind and her son was super helpful - taking all my questions patiently! The area was great with public transport and restaurants. Very nice place and very nice people!",9.0
"Simple, pretty, almost wordless. It's really pretty. 

The only thing I could say about the room was that the amenities were a little off.  Why not toothpaste instead of mouthwash? There's a whole set of things in the bathroom but no shower gel?  It's a bit inconvenient location-wise, especially for tourists (because there are many good restaurants in the north).

I only saw the room briefly, but they lent me an umbrella when it started raining. The person was very kind and friendly. 

By the way, there were two rooms available, and the one I stayed in had a slight difference from the pictures, but it wasn't a big deal.  There is a small space for toiletries.",9.0

Do note though, there are three flights of stairs and no elevator. Luckily, their son and an older gentleman gladly helped me with my suitcase.",9.0

I was really glad that my room had a desk and privacy shades that also let in natural light.

The location was excellent, I was actually able to walk everywhere, including nice restaurants, old town, Mount Royal, bus terminal etc..

"Grace and Irwin's flat was a really good choice. The place looks decent enough from the outside, even better inside. They did mention that the water pressure isn't the best, but it still worked fine - not really a big issue for me. It's really good value for money given its location.

Great location. Close to the metro station. Very clean. Good communication.,9.0
"I stayed here for a week and overall had a good stay. I didn't get to talk to Irwin in person (only through messages) but I talked to Grace and their son quite a few times and both of them were so welcoming, friendly, and helpful.

The location is incredible. The apartment is located near the Concordia University Metro station, as well as a bus stop that will get you to a lot of places. The city in general is very walkable and the location really takes advantage of that - there are quite a few restaurants/cafes/grocery stores within a 15 minute walking distance, and the main downtown shopping area is close too. Vieux Montréal is just a short metro ride away.

The apartment itself is very clean and while the kitchen/dining area is small, it's well laid out and fully equipped. While I didn't use it during my stay, there is an in-unit washer/dryer. The room is a nice size, and I liked that there was a private bathroom attached. The bed was pretty hard, which didn't really bother me but is something to keep in mind. Sheets, a towel, a pillow, some hangers in the closet, toilet paper and body wash were all provided. The air con was awesome too, especially since it gets quite hot/humid in the summer.

My biggest negative staying here was the water pressure. They warned me beforehand that the building was old and therefore the water pressure could be low from time to time, but to just wait a few minutes and try again. Typically this wouldn't bother me at all, but there were two days where I couldn't take a shower because there wasn't water, even after waiting 30 or more minutes. When there was water, there was a light stream - sufficient enough to wash hands, but not much else. I hate leaving negative feedback, and maybe I just came on a bad week, but it was something that bothered me enough where I feel it's important to let other guests know. I truly hope they're able to fix the water pressure problem somehow, because apart from that everything was perfect.",9.0

Would highly recommend and would love to return on my next visit.",9.0
"A perfect experience at Grace & Irwin’s place! A very cozy bedroom of enough space for two or even three adults with a spacious and very clean private bathroom inside. Everything in the room is in good condition. The WIFI connection is fast and stable. Some previous reviews mentioned that there could be some water pressure issues, but it did not bother me at all during my stay since I found I was able to take a bath every day. The shared living room has an open kitchen with a wide variety of cookers. I was told I could cook there and use anything available. Grace hosted me during my stay and she is very friendly, accommodating, and responsive. She answered my questions quickly and made check-in and check-out very smooth. The place looks very safe, with electronic code locks for each private room and two other doors to be locked from the outside of the building.  The location is also perfect! It's in downtown Montreal and very near a number of famous and top-rated restaurants. It’s within a one or two minute walk from a metro station so traffic is quite convenient as well. In short, this is a perfect place with a perfect host! I would choose this place again if I come back to Montreal next time. 
 
In summary, whether it's the hardware facilities, cleanliness, safety, location, or convenience of transportation, everything is perfect. The landlord is also very nice and responsible, and I will definitely stay here again if possible in the future.",9.0

"I chose Grace and Irwin's place in Montreal because I really liked the apartment they showed and described on the Airbnb website, as well as how close it was to the metro station and many places in downtown Montreal. However, even though being close to this service and the location I just described, I had a lot of trouble with other issues during my stay.

My main problems were the water pressure in the apartment was not good since the first week I arrived to the apartment, and this problem was never given a solution to during my whole stay there. There were several times when I got really late to several appointments at my job, had to cancel plans or reschedule my whole day because the water pressure would be so low that I couldn't take a shower without the water stopping every 2 minutes, and sometimes even for 30 minutes, making it impossible for me to take a whole shower in a short amount of time. Several times I had to write the owners to ask for a solution, since this kept being a bother to me and I only kept being told to be patient and try to understand the situation. During my stay in Montreal, this problem only kept getting worse, both in quantity (every time the amount of water coming out of the shower, bathroom and kitchen sink would be even less) and frequency (it kept happening more and more frequently, first every week, then every 3 days until it was every day) and what got me really disappointed is that I never felt this situation was handled correctly by the owners. It wasn't until my last week in the apartment that the water situation got so bad that it ran out completely and my roommate and I were left with NO water for two and a half days, that one of the owners went by and saw the problem herself. I didn't like that still, there was no solution to the problem. During these days, I had to buy several bottles and gallons of water and even subscribe to a gym in order for me to take showers and be able to use a bathroom. It was a problem that really changed the whole perception I had of the apartment as well as the owners' abilities to solve conflicts raised during the stay of a visitor. As I mentioned in one point to the owners, this kind of trouble was never described like this neither in person nor on the Airbnb website, and I think it should be mentioned before someone decides to stay in a new place.

Also, I have to mention that I did not feel comfortable being in the apartment several times because the owners of the building or part of their family would enter into the apartment and use the utensils there (e.g.: the kitchen, washer, dryer, etc.) while the guest were there. This made me feel as if I had no privacy and I was not paying for a place to be my home for those weeks, but instead felt as if it was not my apartment and I couldn't feel comfortable there.

Besides this, the apartment is really well located in Downtown Montreal and the location of the metro (1 minute walk) is a real plus for this building.",9.0

The apartment was beautiful, an incredible space filled with unique décor, furniture, and art, much of which was custom made by Daniel himself. The private room no doubt matched the rest of the place, comfortable, clean, and stylish.

Daniel's apartment was a lovely place to stay. The location was excellent - right in the heart of the Plateau and well connected to downtown via public transport. Nearby shops made it easy to self-cater, but there were also plenty of cafes and restaurants if you preferred not to cook. The Mile End is within walking distance, and Patisserie Au Kouign Amann (which makes the best croissants in town) is only a minute away.

Daniel has several rooms available. This one is smaller, but has a desk, something that was particularly useful for me as I was traveling primarily for work.",10.0

The bedroom itself is quiet, charming, and peaceful - your own little oasis. The bed is also very comfortable, and the room is very dark at night, with no noise from the street -- so it's great for catching up on sleep.

Daniel is a lovely person and it was a joy to meet him and chat over coffee in the mornings. He goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and at home in his apartment, and has even stocked the bedroom with guidebooks to help you plan your trip. 

This was the absolute PERFECT place to stay for a beautiful, peaceful, fun and relaxing week in Montreal. I'm already dreaming about my return :)",10.0

"Daniel was the most delightful host. Friendly, welcoming, and a perfect balance of giving one personal space while also being there to have a nice chat. He is an excellent conversationalist, and it was really nice just to be able to chat casually with him (in French, and of course, he speaks English as well). The apartment and bedroom were spotless and just so cozy during a very cold week. I absolutely loved that my comfy room had its own adjustable thermostat. Daniel's cats are sweet and calm, and quite adorable when they peek their noses outside in the cold snow. You could literally crawl to the metro station from Daniel's place; it is phenomenally located. There's also the bus that goes to the top of the mountain that stops just in front of his place. 

Furthermore, you will sleep like an angel as Daniel's place is incredibly quiet (being two flights of stairs above the street and set back a bit as well). The kitchen was fully equipped with plenty of space for one's own food in the cupboards and fridge. 

It was one of the most relaxing weeks I've spent in a long time. 

Merci Daniel! :)",10.0

There were two other guests staying there at the same time as me but I didn't even see them, nor hear them!

The area feels very safe and it is extremely close to the Metro station, which is especially useful if you are visiting in freezing midwinter.  I did walk quite a lot even though it was so cold, and I can imagine that in the summer this would be a great base for exploring the city on foot too.

This was my second stay at Daniel's apartment. Once again I had a great time. Daniel was a very welcoming host and his apartment is perfectly located for exploring all that the Plateau has to offer.

"Daniel was a very accommodating and gracious host! The location of his place is right by the Mont-Royal Metro, which is essential for those of us who want to explore Montreal on foot.

I'll definitely stay here again on my next visit to Montreal!",10.0
"I felt very lucky to start my first Airbnb experience at Daniel's. The location is superb, with the metro just steps away across the street. Daniel is my first impression of Montreal; he is always there to help and provide advice on good restaurants, easy ways to travel around, etc. I felt very welcomed home. The place is cozy, clean, clear, and quiet! I will hopefully return in June (for summer) and October (for autumn) next year. Daniel's is my first choice; hopefully, I will have the luck to book a room there then (he is so popular).",10.0
"This was my second time staying at Daniel's place in Montreal. It was absolutely delightful. The room is cozy, warm and quiet, with a comfy bed and desk for convenient working with laptop (and great wifi, too!). But even more than that, Daniel is the best of hosts, always ready to chat or share a coffee over conversations. Furthermore, he even prepared a New Year's Eve dinner, as well as French Toast for New Year's Day brunch. One feels totally at home and at ease chez Daniel. I cannot recommend it more!",10.0

"Daniel was very kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable about Montreal. His home was spotless, and located in a great neighborhood near many restaurants and just across the street from the Metro station - very convenient! Daniel had great recommendations for places to grab a bite to eat in the neighborhood and also helpful suggestions about visiting Montreal in general. He kindly made coffee each morning, and offered an extra blanket because the temperatures were so low outside. I look forward to visiting Montreal in the summer and will definitely stay with Daniel again!",10.0

"Daniel was very welcoming. The place was exactly as described. The bed was very comfortable, and the place was charming. Highly recommended.",10.0
"Daniel was very friendly and gave me tons of information about the city. There were two other guys in the other two bedrooms and they were awesome people too. The apartment was absolutely true to the photos shown and most importantly, it was very clean. There is a bar just three stores down the same block, and my room faces the back alley, so it might be a bit noisy over the weekend though. 

The apartment is very conveniently located (close to the metro, and two stops from the central metro station). I was attending a conference at UQAM and Concordia, so that was perfect.

I want to thank Daniel for making me feel really welcome, especially since this is my first time using Airbnb. I definitely hope to visit the city again.",10.0
"I had a wonderful stay in Montreal at Daniel's place! He is an outstanding host and works very hard to make sure his guests enjoy their stay. He is very knowledgeable about the city and has great ideas for places to go and things to do. He has many guidebooks and maps he will go through with you, he gave me some great information on Parc Mont Royal as well as some neighborhood walks. Plus, he makes great coffee and is an excellent chef! 

The apartment is very cozy and well-equipped. This bedroom is perfect for solo travelers or students, and is an outstanding value. Be aware that it is not large - however it is very comfortable, there is a closet for clothes, and a desk to read or work. With the desk and wifi I was able to get some work done to meet a deadline while I was gone. 

The neighborhood and location are both great. There are shops, restaurants, and a good market all close by. The metro is very close, and Saint-Laurent street and Mont Royal Park are all just a walk away. I stayed in June for the F1 Grand Prix, and the Plateau neighborhood was a nice change from the normal race crowd and activities. I felt that there were few to no tourists around, so I felt like I was living like a local, which I enjoyed. 

Comfortable and fun apartment, wonderful host, and a great location. I hope to stay here again!",10.0
"Hello Gabrielle,

I just spent 10 days at Daniel's place in his very nice apartment in the Mount Royal neighborhood. The apartment is right next to the metro, and it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the city center by going down St Denis street.  For me, I loved all the nearby bookstores. I found six within a 15-minute radius around the apartment. It was my first Airbnb experience and I am delighted. Daniel welcomed me very warmly and made me feel at ease. He showed me the neighborhood, gave me his Montrealer experience. He is available, proactive and discreet at the same time. I occupied the room at the end of the apartment and had everything I needed with plenty of decorative details that make you feel like home. A Japanese person was occupying another room, and it went very well, especially thanks to Daniel's ability to reconcile everyone's expectations. I encourage you to take advantage of this great opportunity. Thank you Daniel",10.0

Thanks for having me at your place, Daniel.",10.0

Daniel is a great host and bilingual expert of Montreal. He responded very quickly to all messages. The location is perfect for experiencing Montreal. My best recommendations.,10.0
"A magnificent apartment two steps from the Mont-Royal metro station, a perfect room for my needs (periods of rest during the day, evenings and mornings to prepare calmly before going on sightseeing), an extra neighborhood where it is pleasant to stroll, proximity to the charming Parc de la Fontaine, very pleasant and enjoyable welcome by Daniel, with a very successful alchemy between exchanges and autonomy... In short, having been hosted by Daniel counts a lot in the excellent memory I keep of my stay in Montreal.",10.0
"There aren't enough words to describe how great Daniel is, or how wonderful his place is. The room was everything I could have needed and wanted, and his place overall is warm, welcoming, and exactly as described. I especially loved sitting on the plant-filled terrace chatting with Daniel and the other guests. The location could have been any more convenient, fewer than 200 steps to the metro from his front door, but also dangerously close to Pâtisserie au Kouign Amann! There are also loads of other great places within a short walking distance as well. Daniel is a consummate host, taking me on a walking tour upon my arrival, suggesting endless options for places to go and things to do (his guidebook here conveniently matched up with a lot of what I wanted to do...trust his insight!), and always being up for a great conversation - always welcomed to a solo traveler. I've already suggested his place to many friends, and I can't wait to return myself!",10.0
"Daniel's place is perfect - the room is exactly as described, small but really comfortable, with a nice big window for fresh air overlooking a quiet back street. And the place is spotless.

The neighborhood is great; I loved it. It's busy enough that you have everything you need at your doorstep (including a Metro station, 3 stops from the old town), but at the same time has a great small 'hood feel to it. I really enjoyed walking around and discovering the alleyways, staircases, and murals - be sure to make time to explore this area.

Daniel was easy to communicate with and he is very pleasant to chat with and interact with.

I highly recommend it.",10.0

"This place is, in a word, AMAZING! Daniel's apartment is a great bang for the buck, located as it is in one of the hippest and liveliest neighborhoods in downtown. It's just a stone's throw from the metro, which gets you just about anywhere you'd want to go. There are cafés, shops, and restaurants galore. The apartment itself has all the charm you would expect of a 110-year-old building, and I spent many delighted mornings having coffee and breakfast on the pleasant outdoor patio. The best part is Daniel, who is without question the most friendly, pleasant, kind, and helpful host I have ever encountered on Airbnb. I felt completely at home in his apartment and greatly enjoyed his company, as well as that of the other guests. I would stay here again anytime; it was exactly the experience that I had been hoping to have in Montreal and I commend this lovely spot to any travelers looking to forge a connection with the city.

"Daniel, put simply, is a consummate host. This is my first Airbnb experience and he has set the bar high. From the get-go, he was proactive in communicating with his guests. For example, by giving me directions to his place and informing me that the roads were closed due to a festival before I arrived, so that I could plan an alternative route to his place. He even greeted me at the door and gave me a quick tour around Montreal as it was my first time visiting Quebec. Bilingual and affable, Daniel ensures that his guests are comfortably well-settled, especially for English speakers who may have difficulties navigating around Montreal. His apartment is clean and his two cats, Paco and Baboo, are absolutely adorable. Depending on your preferences, Daniel can be a guide and friend, or simply a host if you wish it to be. It is his versatile approach to hosting that impresses me the most.

Location-wise, his place is steps away from the Mont-Royal métro and in the heart of the French Ghetto. Good food is found everywhere. La Banquise and Fameux for Poutine, L'Avenue for brunch, Yokato Yokabai for ramen, pâtisserie kouign aman and plenty more. For bibliophiles, there is a ton of francophone bookshops nearby.

In short, I had a pleasant stay and got to experience a (very) local taste of Montreal. Thank you very much, Daniel!",10.0

The only downside for me was the internet wifi in the bedroom, which was terrible. As an avid internet user, this was very annoying. However, there's no problem with the wifi in the living room.

Always within walking distance are numerous supermarkets, restaurants and shops of all kinds.

"The apartment was great (my partner exclaimed on our first day there that it was like the love child of Salvador Dali and Frida Kahlo) and being right across from the Jean Talon Market is a huge perk. We were able to go shopping at the market and then cook rather than eating out for every meal. Everything was clean and bright and colorful, and we had no problems finding the apartment or getting around the city; it's just two blocks from the metro station. Catherine was very helpful and we really enjoyed our stay, it made me want to move to Montreal!",9.0

Lovely apartment. No contact with the host but a descriptive note about the place was quite sufficient.",9.0
"I didn't get to meet Catherine, but she gave me the proper instructions on how to get into the apartment easily. I really enjoyed my stay and felt like I had plenty of space. The apartment was equipped with all the essential needs for a week-long stay. Before I arrived, she had a family of 4 staying for an extended period of time. There was a little hiccup with the cleaning person getting around to the apartment before my stay. Nevertheless, Catherine apologized and rectified the situation by having them come as soon as possible and refunding me for two nights. It was an understandable situation given the last guests' long stay and leaving on the day I arrived. I definitely would stay again and love the decor! The neighborhood is a great location near the Jean Talon Market and Metro station, within walking distance.",9.0
"The apartment was cute and cozy, and the location was amazing. We were a short walk to the metro, Jean Talon market, and Little Italy. If you are okay with long walks, we even walked to Mile End neighborhood one night. Buses are easy to get from the apartment. The kitchen had all the utensils needed to cook some meals (which we especially enjoyed since Milano market was nearby and we kept buying groceries just because everything there was so tempting!). Didn't meet Catherine, but getting the keys was easy. A great place to stay!",9.0
"We did not meet Catherine but the communication was very good (before and during) our stay. The arrival went very smoothly. The photos are faithful to reality although they do not do justice to the accommodation. Very well-arranged, with all the necessary kitchen equipment (especially an espresso machine !!!!

The location is GENIAL: two steps from Jean Talon market, a mere 5 minutes walk from the Jean Talon metro station, which has a Metro supermarket. Supermarché Provigo is about 15 minutes away on foot. A quiet street and not too busy, yet next to all necessities. I highly recommend it!",9.0
"Our experience at Catherine's place was really good. We spent a month there, and the apartment is just perfect for a long or short stay. The pictures don't do justice to the size of the place. We loved the neighborhood; there's a huge market right next to her place and also lots of amazing restaurants. It's a privileged area I believe, because it's far enough from the center for things to be cheaper but you still have lots of options to eat. The location is just a little bit far from tourist attractions, around 20-30 minutes by subway to each one, but her place is right next to the subway station, which is awesome!",9.0
"Catherine's apartment is very vibrantly decorated, with each room a different bright color and bold decorations. Our favorite thing about the apartment was the nice big kitchen, which was equipped with good cookware and a nice little espresso machine. There were many negative aspects to our stay. When we first arrived, there was no information about internet or other details, so we had to search for an internet cafe in order to contact Catherine. We then had to wait quite some time before getting an answer -- an overall frustrating experience. We stayed in the flat for a month in the winter and had to go up precarious steps each day. It was our responsibility to shovel the steps and remove the ice, but no shovel was provided. Another major issue was the broken window in the bedroom. It was covered with plastic, which kept the heat in very well, but it didn't block any of the noise coming from the street, which was a problem on some nights. Another thing to keep in mind is that only one set of keys was provided. This was quite inconvenient for us because we were two people. In general, whenever we had an issue, we were told to solve it ourselves. We managed to figure things out in the end, and the location close to the metro and nice restaurants made up for many of our frustrations.",9.0
"We really enjoyed our stay. Catherine's place was warm and inviting, tidy, clean and well-maintained, and we appreciated that she had made room for us to keep our stuff. We also appreciated the well-supplied kitchen, so we could cook with the nice pots and pans, and use the espresso machine. The neighborhood is also great. You're right next to Jean-Talon Market, which is the ideal place to get fresh groceries.",9.0

It has everything you need for any length of stay. 
Kitchen cupboard doors won't stay shut (bluetac must have been used in pictures to keep them shut lol) and there are no handles on drawers and doors. My personal feeling about the bed placement... I would like to be able to get around it. Need better TV reception.

"Hello,

We had fifteen wonderful days in Montreal, and Pascale's house is a real gem!

It's perfect for family stays. It's spacious, very comfortable, charming, and functional.  Plus, it's ideally located in the heart of Little Italy, with easy access to public transportation (the metro), shops (Traditions, Jean Coutu, St Hubert Street...), and cozy little restaurants (Les Empoteuses). To top it off, Pascale was a wonderful host with her explanations, flexibility, and kindness. All this allowed us to experience the true essence of Quebec life within the house. 

In one word: go for it!",9.0
"We didn't hesitate to contact Pascale and Alex, and we weren't disappointed at all. The house was clean, well-organized, and welcoming, very well located in a pleasant and warm neighborhood. With our children, we truly enjoyed this accommodation and we promise to return. Based on our experience, it was a chance to taste the Montreal life from the Petite Patrie neighborhood. The alley where they were able to play safely and leave their drawings, the garden, and the ambiance of the neighborhood particularly marked our children who didn't want to leave. The hospitality of Pascale and Alex, their availability and simplicity added to our pleasure of staying with them. There are no questions to ask when contacting them. It was great. Thank you to the whole family.",9.0
"Sympathetic location, ideal for small family... Etienne, the host, is pleasant (we communicated by phone and in writing), he answered my questions promptly.

The Villeray neighborhood is an undeniably charming place, with the Jean-Talon market (especially in the summer) at its heart.",9.0
"Etienne's apartment is exactly as described in the listing, no unpleasant surprises.

"The condo was very nice, clean, and it was nice to have access to some movies etc. for nighttime entertainment. Although Patrick wasn't there, Viviane, his friend, coordinated key drop-offs and was very nice and helpful. The location was nice, within about 6-8 minutes of the Berri UQAM metro station, and a 10-30 minute walk from many things to do in the city. There was some construction near the apartment (normal for spring/summer in Montreal) but it was very well insulated from the sound. Would recommend to anyone who needs a place to stay, underground parking was also a big plus.",10.0

"The apartment was well-located, modern, comfortable, and clean.",10.0
"We really enjoyed our stay at Patrick's place - it was easy to communicate with him and the place itself was really clean. The building is new so all the amenities are nicely done and it feels safe. You're close to St. Catherine's as well as St. Laurent, it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to the metro... the only small issue being that you are also close to a few sketchier bars where there are some sketchier people. The bed was not comfortable but we would otherwise highly recommend Patrick for anyone thinking of a future visit!",10.0

We definitely recommend Patrick's condo for a perfect stay in Montreal.",10.0
"Patrick's place was perfect, just like the pictures. No issues getting the keys at all - one of Patrick's friends met us out front when we arrived, showed us around the apartment. 

It was freshly cleaned and all the basics were supplied, and the kitchen was fully decked out too (we didn't do any cooking but would have been set if we had).

The location was pretty amazing - we were walking distance from almost everything, including restaurants, shopping, festivals, and more!

I would definitely recommend Patrick's place for your next Montreal stay; I know we'll be staying again for sure :)",10.0

"Patrick's place was just perfect - ideally located in the city center, near public transportation and convenient to many local attractions. He couldn't meet me for check-in but made alternate arrangements that worked out perfectly. He was even kind enough to allow me a late checkout on Sunday. 

He provided some brochures and maps of the area, and his Airbnb guidebook was really helpful for neighborhood convenience stores and best things to visit in Montreal.",10.0
"It's a nice modern apartment in a convenient location, walkable to all tourist spots in central Montreal. You have everything you need in the apartment. One thing to bear in mind is that this is clearly the host's home for some or most of the time, and you will find his clothes in the closet, his food in the fridge etc. Check-in and check-out was fine.",10.0

The apartment is bright, modern, very clean and well-equipped. We were traveling with an 11-month-old, and this was also her favorite stop!

The location is great, right on the doorstep of a metro station and the famous Jean Talon market.

I would not hesitate to recommend it if you are visiting Montreal.",10.0
Very true to pictures... Incredibly convenient location... Pretty good price for being rented during the world cup.,10.0

The apartment is spacious, pleasant, clean and very well located in the city. Alexandre and Bénédicte are very available hosts with whom it's easy to exchange. Thank you both, not forgetting Clémence, adorable.",10.0
"We were profusely welcomed upon our arrival at Alexandre's beautiful flat. It is precisely as depicted in the picture and extravagantly comfortable. Of particular note is the outdoor space at the back which is shaded and lovely in what could be perceived as a back alley, but, courtesy of some plantings and an overhanging tree, is transformed into an idyllic outdoor deck. As mentioned, indoors is equally calm and comfortable. The neighborhood is an up-and-coming part of the city with lots of restaurants, a grocery store, and shops nearby. Also easily accessible to downtown Montreal, especially once the metro is back in operation.",10.0
"We had a pleasant stay in the heart of a typical Montreal neighborhood. The apartment is very spacious and well-equipped, close to public transportation, cherry on top: the terrace at the back for good moments of relaxation at the end of the day after exploring the city.  A short walk from there, St-Hubert Street is worth a visit.",10.0
"First Airbnb experience was very positive. The exchanges with Bénédicte were very cordial. The apartment is super! First of all, it's super clean and modern, with everything you need to cook, a nice touch is that they provide laundry detergent and dishwasher tablets.

"Maria's apartment in Plateau was perfect for our stay in Montreal! The apartment is very spacious, well decorated, and stocked with everything you could need during your stay.

"A clean, comfortable apartment on a quiet street in the heart of the action.

When I arrived, Maria was there saving me a parking spot right in front of my door! Maria is amazing, full of life and energy.",9.0
"I didn't meet Maria but she was quick to communicate via text. Overall the place was clean but lacked some comforts such as extra pillows and blankets. A small table and chairs would have been nice on the balcony for outdoor dining. I would suggest bringing tea/coffee to get your day started. A list of local cafes in the neighborhood would have been helpful as well as the nearest SAQ, grocery store, and Metro station. 

I discovered a fabulous cafe a block away called Neve's. A wonderful way to start your day. As a rule, Montrealers are super friendly and helpful. The Plateau is a great place to discover. Maria's Place is well-situated.",9.0
"I stayed a half month in Maria's apartment for a mission in Montreal. 

Very well located, close to the Hôtel-de-Ville and Rachel, in a quiet street but an animated neighborhood, within a 7/8 minute walk of the metro, 10 minutes walking from Mount Royal, 5 minutes walking from shops, bakeries etc. 

The neighborhood is very nice with cute cafes within 2 minutes walking distance (Névé, Santropol, Réplika), super restaurants (l'Express, le Pied de Cochon, le Filet, etc.), there's even a tuxedo rental place within 15 minutes walking distance in case of evening dress for visitors (Maison Waxman), I wouldn't have wanted to live anywhere else.

The apartment itself: totally authentic, in line with Maria, a host full of life, very reactive and concerned about the well-being of her tenants. Photos faithful.
No problems raised during my stay, Maria even instantly increased the internet speed at my request. The apartment is cross-ventilated, which makes it very pleasant. Being present in winter I didn't enjoy the terrace but an outdoor point remains precious! 

I would recommend them closed eyes if you are staying long term in Montreal.",9.0
perfect location,9.0
"Maria's place was lovely. It is in an old building as she states, so stairs are steep and narrow and not a lot of room when you open the door but when you get to the top it is worth it! We were there for the Grand Prix, so easy access to the metro to get to the track. A bit further away from all the other action going on in Old Montréal. We managed to get tickets for the Aura at the Basilica and highly recommend it!",9.0
"A charming two-bedroom apartment with a kitchen and a small patio, full of character, tastefully furnished, impeccably clean and imbued with a perfect sense of hospitality (including Maria's presence to help us settle in).  Furthermore, the apartment is located in a very lively and pleasant neighborhood (Le Plateau, near the metro, within walking distance of the historic center, interesting but very densely populated). There are many charming little restaurants and bars nearby.  IN SHORT: VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Montreal.",9.0
"Maria is a wonderful hostess who pays attention to every single detail. She is one of the friendliest and most honest hosts I have ever met. The place has a wonderful atmosphere.

Thank you, Maria, for being such an attentive host.",9.0
"This is the most interesting part of Montreal, and Maria's place is the perfect base. It's comfortable, light, private, has everything you need - including organic toiletries - and is ideal especially if you're traveling solo. Maria's plants are all thriving too; you can tell this is someone's home and even though she's not there, she treats you like a real guest. This year she added ceiling fans, so even as a repeat guest, it exceeded my expectations! Great communication and would stay every time I return to Mtl.",9.0

We have very fond memories of our stay with Denis.",10.0

"This was our first time in Canada, and instead of renting Denis's place for vacation we rented it to be our home for the first month as new residents in Canada. We enjoyed every minute in the apartment and the area is close to everything. The apartment has everything you need in order to be your house and the hosts are extraordinary. Thank you so much for having us, and allowing us to call your apartment ""Our Home"". This space will not be sufficient to describe how my family and I felt during our stay.",10.0
"This upstairs apartment is located in an older, very quiet, and well-established part of Montreal. It's on a lovely tree-lined street and is very close (within a few blocks) to grocery stores and restaurants. The apartment itself is spotless, very spacious, and well-lit by natural light. When you look out the living room and kitchen windows, you see lots of trees. There is a nice back deck just off the kitchen if you want to have a barbecue. The TV has over 1000 channels. The owner warmly welcomed us to the apartment and showed us all the amenities and supplies in the place, and I must say that they went to great lengths to anticipate every need we could possibly have. They were available in person, by phone, and email whenever we had a question. A very relaxing place to stay!",10.0
"This home was very very pleasant to stay in. We were met by Kosta, Denis Dad who lives downstairs. VERY VERY friendly gentleman who made us feel so welcome and so at home. As soon as we arrived (we were very exhausted) but he showed us everything, and told us if we needed anything he is more than happy to be of help. 

The home is in a prime location right by a main boulevard - so really you are just a few steps away to access public transit or tons of restaurants, markets etc. Neighborhood was very quiet, lots of families so very very safe. 

The home was very comfortable, TV had plenty of options, kitchen and dining area were pleasant and beds were very comfortable. 

When we left Kosta even washed our car! So nice of him!

We had a short stay but would definitely come back.",10.0

The accommodation is spacious, clean, and very well located (close to transportation and several amenities on Côte-des-Neiges). I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone.",10.0
"We were not typical visitors. I grew up in Montreal and I was returning in order to spend time with a sick elderly relative. We chose the location as it is within walking distance of the hospital. I was grateful that we were able to be close by.

Kosta met us at the door. He was most welcoming. He gave us a thorough tour of the apartment. It certainly fit all of our needs. We didn't need a description of Montreal and all that is available there. I know he hoped to be more involved, however our situation was different and we were anxious to get to St. Mary's hospital.",10.0

There were ceiling fans in most rooms which helped us not need the air conditioner at all during our stay. The terrace overlooks a beautifully landscaped (by Kosta) backyard.  Kosta and his wife were very friendly with us and helpful with any questions we had.

Thank you again for a pleasant stay.",10.0
"Great for someone who still wants to feel at home but be close to the downtown area.

We had everything we needed in the apartment: a fully equipped kitchen, air conditioning (it gets hot in Montreal during the summer), an excellent TV, Wi-Fi, a large bedroom, and a terrace where we enjoyed our meals. All shops and services are nearby. The metro station (Plamondon) is eight minutes walk away. An excellent address, quiet and in the heart of Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood.

"Marie was very accommodating of our arrival and departure. 

We felt more than welcome when she pre-approved our stay which excited us even more. 

The place was spotless upon our arrival and it was as cozy as a house of our own (as the title suggests). 

There was heating which kept us warm in Montreal's bitter winter.

I might add that Marie prepares you for arrival with maps and some great restaurant recommendations that were all very useful to us. 

We would definitely visit this place again because the location was close to downtown and Marie made us feel very comfortable. I would recommend this house to anyone visiting Montreal with friends or family.",10.0
"My friends and I had a great time staying at Marie's home! She was very accommodating and helpful. When we could not figure out how to connect to the Wifi, I sent her a text message and within minutes I received a response and everything was fixed.

Veronique was very responsive leading up to our trip and had towels, sheets, and information on Montreal ready for us.

The cat Phil (I hope that's how I write his name) is nice and wants cuddles all the time. 

The place has a good space, especially a really great balcony outside the kitchen. It's also located on a street with pharmacies, markets, bakeries, restaurants, bars, some stores, an awesome fruit/vegetable market, and a butcher shop.

Although it is a little far away, it's easy to get downtown, and as a bonus the Olympic sports center is nearby.",10.0

"Véronique opens the door to her apartment in Montreal with much kindness and sympathy. Phil the cat is an adorable companion seeking cuddles. The photos are exactly as they appear, the apartment is charming, the bed comfortable, and the place is quiet. Bus 47 stops almost right in front, and buses 27 and 67 pass by nearby. A supermarket is a 5-minute walk away, Masson Promenade with shops and restaurants within walking distance.  A 15-20 minute walk takes you to the park for life with the beautiful botanical garden. Be prepared for some travel time to reach downtown, but Montreal is so vast that you can't have everything. I am delighted with this stay! Thank you Véronique.",10.0
"It was really good staying! 
Veronique is very kind and her reply is fast.

"Veronique's place is down a lovely street with pretty much everything you need. There are a couple of pharmacies, a few grocery stores, and plenty of places to eat. There's a little place that does amazing pastries and coffee on the corner near where the bus stop is (opposite the noodle place) that I really recommend! It's right near two bus routes, both of which take you to metros so transportation is really good.

In terms of the actual house, it has everything you would need. It's not fancy, but the bed is comfy, there's plenty of storage, and the shower is nice and hot! There is only one plug location in the room, so I would take a cord or something if there are two of you, but aside from that, Veronique has everything you need. Phil the cat is delightful (he's so big!!!) and gives you a lovely welcome. 

Thank you!",10.0
"We stayed at Veronique's home for about one month and had a nice time there. 

Our room was comfortable and clean with enough space for our large luggage.  There were all the necessary amenities in the kitchen that you could make your own meals if you liked.

There were two balconies which, in winter, are freezing out there to enjoy fresh air but surely in summer it would be wonderful. 

The location is perfect, near several restaurants, pharmacies, grocery stores and shops, which helps you eat or buy what you want. It's close enough to bus stops that take you to metro stations.

If you like to talk, you can have nice chats with Veronique, and if you want your own privacy, she is very respectful. 

Finally, we enjoyed playing with Mr. Phil during our stay as he is so cute and friendly.",10.0
Very good,10.0
"It was my first day in Canada and my first Airbnb with a host. Veronique was friendly and super kind, and her cat too;) She suggested me to wear her winter sport pants if I wanted due to the amazing temperature of Canada. For four days at her place, I felt such a warm atmosphere and enjoyed a lot in Montreal because of that. The room was the same as the photo and it had shower amenities and a hair dryer as well. Everything was fine.",10.0
We spent around 10 days there and felt very comfortable. The kitchen was fully equipped and we could cook and prepare our meals in the cold winter of Montreal. The room was very nice and the bed super comfortable. Sometimes it was difficult to wake up in the mornings. Véronique works during the day but her lovely cat Phil was the guardian of the house all day. He loves to be cuddled. You should like cats if you want to spend time at the apartment.,10.0

"We didn't get to meet Nico, but his roommates were very nice! It was easy to pick up the keys, and when leaving we just left the key in the house on our way out. The place was clean, and the bed was awesome! We got to control the heat in our own room which was really nice, since it was freezing outside! We ended up taking a lot of Uber rides, but we did take the Metro once, and it was convenient to get to; about a 5-minute walk.",10.0

"Stayed here in my first few days of moving to Montreal. The apartment was very well located and the room was perfectly clean; the bed was extremely comfortable and just what I needed to nurse jet lag. Nico's housemate, Morgan, was around to answer my questions and was helpful. Morgan's mom who was visiting, was also sweet, and so very pleasant to be around. 

I didn't meet Nico until I returned two weeks later to pick up my two large suitcases, which Nico and his housemates had kindly allowed me to store in the apartment. While I needed only the basics: good sleep, hot water for coffee, hot shower, central location -- from my quick chat with Nico, I get the sense that he's the kind of host I would like to have when in a new city. He genuinely cared about his guests, and had time in his day to have a quick chat.",10.0

"The apartment looked exactly as pictured. The furniture was new and the apartment was very clean. It was a bit stuffy, but when I asked Flatbook, they brought over a fan. There is a TV, but no cable service (you can hook up a laptop and use your own streaming service). My only complaint about Flatbook was that communicating with them was a bit strange and different from my other experiences with Airbnb (I've always reserved with private homeowners). Though they were certainly responsive, the responses always came from a different employee and there seemed to be uneven communication between them, so I had to repeat my question/request and the backstory each time.",9.0
"This was our first time staying at Flatbook. We found the team to be very efficient, considerate, and professional.  We were a bit late in arriving due to traffic but were still met at the door by smiling faces and a chocolate cake (to celebrate our wedding anniversary).   We very much appreciated the thoughtful gesture.

We were escorted to the flat and were pleased by the cleanliness and functionality of the space. It was exactly what we had hoped for, as well as being centrally located, near transit (metro), shops, and restaurants.  It suited our purposes wonderfully. We were also very pleasantly surprised to find the use of laundry facilities, including soap, had been included in the rental.

The only negative comments concern 1) the fact that this building has a lot of stairs to contend with. So anyone with mobility issues would need to take this into consideration.  And 2) the television is not hooked up to any local channel. Whenever we travel, my wife and I usually like to listen to local news and weather. We managed to get some local information via WIFI by connecting the HDMI cable they provide to our laptop. Flatbook may wish to add a section to their information kit listing local television/radio stations.

Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely recommend this to friends and family.",9.0

"Great spot, close to Parc Mont Royal and lots of great small shops and places to eat; an easy walk to the subway. The apartment is clean and has everything you need. The pull-out sofa is not very comfortable, so I wouldn't recommend this apartment for four adults. It was fine for a family with young kids - i.e., us. It would be great for a couple. Overall we really enjoyed our stay, and even though there was a mix-up with bedding, they were responsive and did their best to sort it out quickly.",9.0
"A perfectly adequate place to stay in every possible way. The apartment is quite spartan and needs repairs, but it's comparable to Plateau apartments overall. I was very satisfied with the value for money.",9.0
"Overall, we had a good stay. The location is great and the neighborhood is charming.  The apartment gets a lot of sun however, which woke us up too early. I've suggested that better blinds be put up.  But the other aspects of the apartment were good. Quiet, clean and pleasant.",9.0
"Booked this place at the last minute and almost everything was great. As mentioned before, something should be done about the blinds. Otherwise, the place was super clean. We had everything we needed in the kitchen and the bathroom. Very easy to communicate with them and very responsive. It was especially hot days when we stayed in Montreal and the A/C being a bit noisy, we asked if they could provide us with a fan and they actually brought two on the same day. That was very much appreciated! I would definitely stay in other flats managed by Sonder.",9.0
"The place was bright, beautiful, and clean and included everything as advertised. The only problem was that there was no power in the entire unit except for the kitchen, so we didn't have air conditioning for the first night. After contacting them and waiting half a day for a reply, we were finally able to get power back by switching the breaker back on. Other than that, it was a perfect place to stay for a few days.",9.0

There are no surprises when you rent from these awesome people; you get what you were promised, if not more. The flat was super clean, with a comfortable bed and top-notch washing machine, dryer, and kitchen equipment. The area is friendly and quiet with nice neighbors. 

Frederique responded to my questions instantly, and cooperated regarding any special requests I had. 

Those people care about Montreal and their guests passionately, so you will also get a guest book with all the information you need about the area you're staying in as well as the best things to do in Montreal. 

Dealing with people of this standard and kindness is heartwarming. I'm glad you guys exist.",9.0
"My stay with Robert at the apartment hosted by Joanna and Frederique was simply amazing. It had all the amenities we needed to make our trip even more enjoyable. We utilized the kitchen often to cook our meals and enjoyed them on the balcony along with the nice weather and serenity of the neighborhood. The wifi was a little slow during the first few days but manageable. Frederique was a wonderful host and consistently checked up with us, responding very quickly to any questions or concerns. There is a very useful packet that came with the place, which provided information on the apartment and many recommendations for anything you could possibly think of—food, shopping, entertainment, etc. The metro was very close to the apartment and the location allowed us to travel very easily to the downtown area of Montreal. Overall, the experience was very satisfying and I certainly recommend anyone traveling to Montreal to stay at this spot! Thanks again, Frederique!",9.0
"Hello,

The apartment we rented on Rue de Verdun is faithful to the photos posted on Airbnb. It's nice and well-equipped in terms of appliances and other amenities. It's not too far from the main road. 

We have a reservation about the quality of the mattress which is too hard and the noise level coming from the (website hidden by Airbnb) room located facing the street, as we can hear all the traffic noises clearly.  It's a shame but considering the apartment's configuration, it can only be placed facing the street. If the bedroom had been able to be placed on the interior side, it would have been great. 

Perhaps some soundproofing could be improved, but apparently this is a reservation I make for most apartments in Montreal, except for modern ones.

Otherwise, I recommend it apart from these reservations.",9.0
"Charming apartment, ideally located near a metro station, easy parking. 

We unfortunately did not meet Joanna but we had excellent written communication and availability, all the practical information about the neighborhood and tips for exploring the city were available upon our arrival.",9.0
"The apartment was very clean upon arrival and the way it does in pictures. The hosts were very helpful and I called them several times to ask questions about a few things, and they were nice and very kind. The guest book provided is very handy and I used it during our stay.

The washer/dryer are super. 
The kitchen is very clean and well-equipped. 
The bathroom is very decent. 
The bed size is okay; personally, I would prefer a bigger bed.
The TV, internet, and AC are all excellent additions. 
The only issue I had was the stairs to the building, and then up to the apartment. I have a knee injury, so you can imagine.

Overall, this place is worth it and it's close to literally everything. You just have to walk a maximum of 10 minutes to be near anything from metro stations...restaurants...markets...pharmacies...grocery stores...etc...
I highly recommend this apartment if you want to have a good time in Montreal!",9.0

The building was 5 minutes from the bus station and within 10 minutes of walking distance from everything! The room is exactly as in the description with some extra fun things Jad has put in the room (we got a lava lamp and a foot massage, haha). It was my first time using Airbnb and honestly, Jad and this location have set the standard. It was perfect.",10.0
My boyfriend and I had a great time at Jad's place. The building has all the amenities you could ask for and is within walking distance to everything.

"Jad is a fantastic host! He was very welcoming, showed us around the building and gave us a brief tour of Montreal. I don't live far from Montreal so I was already familiar with the streets. The apartment was SO clean and it had everything we needed. The view was amazing too, the windows faced Downtown Montreal and was even better when lit up at night. HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone! Although, it is a shared kitchen as it's a residence but that didn't bother me at all. Oh, and, the king-sized bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. All in all, I would recommend Jad's place to anyone!",10.0

We received two room cards and one laundry card, and have access to all the facilities including the communal kitchen. The room was fantastic and high-class, and the host was very considerate -- we have everything in the room that we can possibly think of! Great location and neighborhood, close to McGill University and shopping centers. The only con is residents need to beware of potential drunk students in the building and keep your door closed at all times. Overall wonderful experience. Thank you so much Jad!",10.0

We couldn't be more grateful to Geneviève and Yanick. The apartment was more beautiful than the pictures led on and these hosts were even more kind and easy to work with than we could have hoped for. Total sweethearts... thanks again for everything!,10.0
"We had an amazing stay at this home! It is so much bigger and lovelier than the pictures even convey. The neighborhood is fantastic too.  It's a bit north of the trendy neighborhoods of Mile End and Plateau, but we were so happy we ended up staying here.  It has tree-lined streets with a wonderful village feel.  It also seems to be a destination restaurant neighborhood and we ate really well. I highly recommend both Jean Talon market and the Indonesian tapas bar.  The home itself is airy and spacious with a wonderful back deck. It's particularly good for families.  Coming back after a day out biking and exploring felt like coming home - only much nicer.  Genevieve and Yanick were out of town when we were there but communication was quick and easy and their neighbor Dan was enormously helpful in letting us in and providing advice.  Would definitely stay again if possible.",10.0
"We spent a wonderful week in Geneviève & Yanick's charming home with its lovely back garden terrace. The apartment is very large and well organized for family life (we were two parents with three teens), and possessed all necessary amenities for visitors. The beds are comfortable, the two bathrooms are recently renovated, the kitchen is great to cook in, everything was clean and organized for our arrival, no problems with the wifi or tv.  And the cat is friendly. Our questions were quickly answered. 

The neighborhood is fantastic, very family-oriented, close to two metro lines, several bus lines, a fantastic bakery, Jean-Talon market, great restaurants, Dumoulin bike shop, Bixi bikes...you can walk everywhere you need to go!

We highly recommend this home for families traveling.",10.0
Genevieve and Yanick's place was in a very good location! The house is located in a very nice neighborhood. It is also very pleasant to live in. Everything was ready for us to have a great weekend! I highly recommend it!,10.0

The adorable cats, and the decor really magnificent! The neighborhood is among the most beautiful in Montreal... I found everything I was looking for, and that on foot! I really enjoyed my experience and I would definitely stay in this room anytime!",10.0
"Very pleasant stay, the room made available to me was entirely in accordance with its description: comfortable, well-furnished and functional. The apartment itself is also very nice and well located at the gates of Little Italy. Finally, a special mention for the particularly friendly, dynamic and involved hosts who helped me discover a delicious Vietnamese restaurant!",10.0
"Felix has a lovely place minutes walk from Jean Talon market and great restaurants, cafes, and shops.

The room itself was clean and cozy, and though we didn't see too much of Felix and her boyfriend, they were very friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable.",10.0
This is a cozy and warm place to stay with the most welcoming people you'll meet. It made my stay in Montreal an amazing experience.,10.0
"We greatly appreciated Félix and his companion's warm and funny side. Upon returning home, we found ourselves in an atypical and colorful universe: the decor is original and vintage. It's a real cabinet of curiosities! You will certainly be welcomed by Choucroute and Moussaka who are the stars of the house ;-)",10.0
"My stay with Felix was a disappointment. I booked with her because she and her boyfriend appeared to be friendly and provide a comfortable living space, but my experience was the opposite. Felix's communication skills as a host were not where I believe they should be. I didn't receive any messages until I contacted her, wasn't informed that she would be away from the apartment until a few hours before my arrival, and received poor instructions regarding the location of the spare key (which led to a drawn-out process entering the apartment upon arrival). When I later asked for her recommendations on places to visit in the city, she made no attempt to offer suggestions, instead directing me to look at a guidebook. 

The apartment lacked comfort and cleanliness. The room itself was fine, but the mattress was very hard. The room is adjacent to the kitchen where most of the social activity happens. Additionally, the walls are thin, which meant that I could clearly hear the neighbor's crying infant baby at various points during my stay. The kitchen sink was stacked high with dirty dishes for most of my stay and clothes were placed on the bathroom floor for extended periods of time. The hosts smoke cigarettes and the smell (which I am sensitive to) entered into the kitchen and my bedroom. 

Overall, I felt unwelcome in Felix and her boyfriend's home. I booked on short notice, but if my stay was too much of a burden, I would have preferred that she not accept my request as there were several other great options in the area. 

On the positive side, the apartment has interesting vintage decor throughout and is well situated in the city. The cats are really sweet.",10.0
"I had an unforgettable stay at Felix's place! Felix and his partner are exceptional people who were able to listen to my requests. Communication was truly excellent, right from the reservation ;) They gave me the best tips for enjoying the neighborhood and the city. 

On the room side, if you're looking for something quiet with original decor, you can't do better. It's a real curiosity cabinet, the apartment is full of vintage objects!

It's worth noting that the apartment is just a few minutes from the metro and all the buses you might need. The neighborhood is teeming with restaurants and bars, and there's a real neighborhood vibe! 

The cleanliness, hospitality, warm and original feel of the room... For me it's a 100%, I highly recommend to everyone Felix and his little haven of peace; )",10.0
"Our stay with Felix and Yvan was once again a wonderful experience! We knew that returning would not disappoint us. Felix is still such good advice. 

Beaubien remains the neighborhood we prefer! It's truly close to everything. In short, a good base in Montreal!",10.0
"Our stay with Félix was fabulous. She was easy to communicate with, check-in was a breeze, we were greeted by an open door and extremely welcoming flat! Her and her boyfriend were as nice as can be and I would absolutely stay here again! I can't recommend them enough!",10.0
"I had an excellent stay at Felix's lovely apartment! Felix and her boyfriend Yvan were extremely kind and welcoming hosts. Felix was quick to respond to my last-minute request and made my arrival very easy.  

The room was very comfortable, and I felt right at home. Felix's apartment is filled with plants and cool vintage knick-knacks. The location is perfect - a charming block in Little Italy near many great bars, cafes, parks, restaurants, and easy walking distance to Mile End and Jean Talon Market. I enjoyed spending hours strolling around the neighborhood during my visit, and found it easy to get downtown and to other parts of Montreal via the nearby metro. It was great to come home after a long day of exploring the city to a glass of wine with Felix and Yvan on their balcony. I had the best time staying here in Montreal!",10.0

"The hosts made my guest and I feel very much at home. Both Felix and Ivan were helpful in making recommendations and urged us to contact them with any problems or concerns. Their artfully decorated space added a comforting aspect to our stay. The location is conveniently located minutes away from a metro station, which made it easy for us to travel. Best of all were the cats, Choupette and Moussaka :)",10.0
"Everything about the trip was perfect! Felix and Ivan were very helpful and answered all of the questions I asked. Even if you don't know anything about the city, the hosts will guide you in the right direction. Their place has a warm and artistic feel to it which is very inviting. The location is fantastic as it is in a ""quiet"" part of town, but still has many restaurants and bars nearby. Even if you don't know anything about the city, the hosts will guide you in the right direction. Felix and Ivan made my first Airbnb experience fantastic and I am sure others will also be impressed.",10.0
"Felix and Ivan were amazing hosts, very helpful and friendly, and not only did they make me feel completely at home, the room was light, comfortable, and very clean. Their two cats were very lovable and friendly. The bed was incredibly comfortable, especially the super soft sheets! 

They had an amazing coffee machine, and everything in the apartment was perfectly clean.

They are located in a vibrant and young residential area with a good variety of restaurants and stores.

"On couldn't have dreamed of better days than the last few with Felix and Ivan. Warmth, friendship, simplicity and intensity of exchanges, what superlative could we find?

"I am very happy with my stay at Félix and Ivan's place. Their accommodation is very well-located, the welcome is very warm and their insightful advice helped me find solutions to all my questions :)

I hope I have the opportunity to cross paths with you on another trip. 

If you want to experience a beautiful Montreal experience, book it without hesitation!",10.0
"Great location on a quiet street in a nice neighborhood. Two blocks from the subway and buses. Necessary amenities are nearby. Felix & Ivan were very hospitable and accommodating. Speaking of accommodating, they speak English - this is Montreal where many people do not speak English. (Perhaps I should learn a little French!)",10.0

It was a pleasure meeting Marius and visiting your bar too!",10.0
"Great communication from Mina ahead of our arrival, making sure we had everything we needed. Everything was all set for us when we arrived. The apartment is very warm and welcoming; nicely laid out and has a very homey feeling. Bedrooms and living room are very comfortable and the kitchen is well equipped.

The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. There's no real noise at night (we slept with the windows open). Great cafes, restaurants, parks, and groceries within a 5-minute walk. The subway is an easy 10-15 minute walk with easy access to downtown.

Overall, this is a great apartment in a great location, and the hosts are very welcoming. Highly recommended!",10.0

"Mina's apartment was a perfect place to stay! Very spacious and even though there were 6 of us, we didn't feel crowded at any time. There was even room to put an extra air bed in the living room. Grocery and SAQ are right around the corner, as well as some of the best ice cream in Montreal! (Bo-Bec). It was nice to relax in Laurier Park after having brunch at nearby Le Toasteur Laurier. Don't forget to walk over to St Denis or St Laurent or down to Mont Royal to check out the shops and restaurants!

As for the apartment itself, it was very clean, the beds were comfy, there were plenty of linens, the shower was amazing, the kitchen was GORGEOUS, and it was handy having the toilet in a separate room from the shower. Both the living room and main bedroom have ample air conditioning - it was quite warm in other parts, but that is expected in a heatwave, I suppose.  Although we did not get to meet Mina, she was available over text and answered the few questions we had, as well as offered her son's contact info (although everything was so organized and straight forward that we didn't need any help!) One thing of note is that the steps are very steep getting in and out of the apartment - possibly not suitable for older people.

I hope to stay here again when I return to Montreal next year. It was nice getting to know a different part of the plateau. Thanks Mina for everything!",10.0
"We never met our host but communication was excellent and we were very pleased with the accommodation. The location was awesome, great neighborhood and if visiting in summer there is an outdoor pool nearby that's great to hang out with friends and family!

That's so much for a great stay!!",10.0
"Mina's apartment was wonderful. It was very clean and the posted pictures are accurate. Communication with Mina before, during and after our stay was great. The location of the apartment was perfect, it was close to transit to get to major attractions, but it was very awesome to stay in a less touristy area to be submerged in the local culture. The neighborhood is wonderful with plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. We did not rent a car while we were there and had no issues getting around. I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Montreal.",10.0
"I stayed with Maureen for a month in June/July 2010. She made sure I had directions to get in, took me to the grocery store to make sure I knew where it was, and was generally a friendly, happy host. One thing not mentioned in the listing is that this is a triplex - Maureen lives on the first floor, I stayed in one of the four bedrooms on the third floor, and she was remodeling the second floor to create four more bedrooms. Guests have great privacy if they want it.

I need to mention that there were ants in the kitchen - Maureen knows and is working to eradicate them, but anyone who's really bothered by bugs might be put off.

I had a great time here. The place was just as described, the neighborhood was calm and safe, and Montreal was lovely. Thanks for having me.",9.0
I stayed with Maureen for a week at the end of July 2011 and couldn't have had a more pleasant time. Maureen was a gracious host who went above and beyond to ensure that I had a wonderful stay. Thanks for all you did to welcome me to the beautiful city of Montreal! :),9.0

"Maureen was a very friendly host who met me upon arrival. The room itself, bathroom, and common area (there were four bedrooms in total) were all very clean and quite pleasant, if somewhat plain. The kitchen (which I did not need to use) could have used a bit of cleaning. 

The neighborhood is nice; very quiet and close to buses, the metro, and great strips of activity on Sherbrooke (a 5-minute walk) and Monkland (a 15-minute walk). Available street parking is a nice bonus for those who drive.

If you're looking for a clean, quiet, and simple place to sleep that's relatively close to downtown, this is a good spot. Perhaps not for those who prefer a more chic B&B environment.",9.0

"I stayed here with my husband and his mom for 5 days, and we felt very comfortable from the moment of arrival. The place is just as advertised, nothing fancy but very clean, well-equipped, and cozy. Ichraf is a friendly and helpful hostess, living right next door. Location is good, with only 10-15 minute walks to the metro, stadium, and Jean-Talon market. Not much choice for restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but that was not an issue for us. Would definitely stay here again! Perfect for either families or friends.",9.0

"This apartment was perfect for us. Everything was as you see in the photos. The rooms were large and clean and well-furnished. Our host, François, who lives downstairs, was very friendly and helpful. He assisted with several small things throughout our stay.

I also really liked the location. It's a quick walk to get back into Montreal across the Lachine Canal, or an even quicker 10-minute subway ride to get downtown. 

And don't overlook the Verdun neighborhood. There are lots of great restaurants, shops, and parks. I really loved the area. 

Overall, I highly recommend it.",10.0

Close to the LaSalle metro, it's an 8-minute walk. Located about 20 minutes from the city, it's top! A Metro supermarket is within walking distance. The photos don't do justice to reality; we loved the apartment. Clean, functional and in a quiet neighborhood. We would have extended our stay if possible.

There's a lot of space and beautiful decoration in each room. A quiet apartment in a really pleasant neighborhood.

It was very comfortable and clean, making it a great choice for anyone visiting Montreal and wanting to enjoy the beautiful charm of Old Montreal!",10.0
"My friend and I stayed at Yanick's place for four nights. Yanick was very quick to respond to our questions, and very helpful overall. He showed us where to find good parking, and checked in on us to make sure things were okay during the trip. The place was even bigger than it looked in the pictures, and just the perfect size for our needs. It was clean when we got there, and the bed had fresh sheets and there were towels for us to use. One thing we wished for was sheets for the futon, since we were not sharing the bed. There was also no space for us to unpack, because the bureau drawers were full. Other than those two things, the place was great and not stuffy at all, though it was on the fourth floor. It's also in a great location, very conveniently located near lots of good restaurants, the waterfront, and the bike path along the river. We would definitely recommend this to anyone, it is WELL worth the price!",10.0
"When I first saw the location and price, I thought this sounded too good to be true. But it IS true! The location is right in the middle of everything picturesque - cobblestone streets right when you step out, Old Port and Old Montreal your neighborhood, around the corner from City Hall and numerous restaurants with scenic patios. You can cross the street to Bonsecours Market, or walk 5 minutes to Notre Dame Bonsecours Chapel and about 10 to Notre Dame Basilica. If you want more than what's immediately walkable, Champs de Mars station is very close. If you drove like we did, there is paid street parking around you for short-term stays, and many lots to choose from for overnight stays. We personally liked the indoor garage on Gosford and Champs de Mars streets.

As for the loft itself, it has beautiful views of Old Port and Old Montreal, as well as a comfortable mattress and futon. It is well kept, and Yanick will provide you with wifi, a refrigerator full of cold water bottles, along with towels and linens. The pictures are exactly how the loft looks. He will also respond to any messages within a couple of days prior to your arrival, and within an hour or so during your stay. Logistics very easy for check-in and check-out.",10.0
"This location may be the best in Montreal. The place is nice and cozy. Only one problem with the sound, there was always a small noise of the air conditioner but if you are not stay at home a lot, it should not be a problem. I will come back if I have a chance",10.0
"Yanick was waiting for me when I arrived, the apartment is in accordance with the description, located on the Vieux Port, tourist street of Montreal. 

It's perfectly situated to go running, there are plenty of restaurants around if you don't want to cook, it's usually the studio occupied by Yanick, perfectly organized for this occasion. Perfect for a couple or a single person looking for a central location.",10.0
"Bright and spacious loft for two, well-arranged. We spent four beautiful days in Montreal thanks to this wonderful pied à terre. 

Yannick, unavailable, had organized our arrival and kept us updated on the progress of our stay. 

One small problem: the noise from the air conditioning. Fortunately, the temperature dropped nicely at night and we could turn it off.",10.0
Yanick was a fantastic host. He was very communicative and helpful. The apartment was clean and had everything you could want to enjoy some time in the heart of Montreal's historic Old Port.,10.0
"We arrived in Montreal a bit late and were fortunate to have international cellphone coverage to message Yanick about our late arrival. He was patient enough to wait for us in the apartment as we navigated around the Old Port to find parking. He spent 15 minutes explaining the accommodations before leaving us with the keys.

The closest overnight parking (1.5 blocks away) is at the Hotel de Ville (Montreal City Hall) and costs $18.75 CAD per 24-hour period. This is a good deal in terms of proximity. The apartment is within walking distance to great restaurants, the waterfront, the Clock Tower beach (our favorite spot to hang out), and public transportation.

The apartment has excellent air conditioning and met our needs. The bed was comfortable, Wi-Fi was excellent, the bathroom was clean, and the air conditioning was wonderful during the warm summer days. It's a great location and we would stay here again.",10.0
"It was a wonderful experience in Montreal. The location is right at the heart of the old port. Everything is within walking distance, the kitchen is highly functional, there's a comfortable bed, washer/dryer and mostly I like the showers - they relieved all fatigue after a long day of walking. I highly recommend this place!!!!! 

Why wait? This place will make your visit to Montreal even better!",10.0
"Yanick's place was the **perfect** home base for a weekend escape to Montreal. I stayed for two nights with a friend. The location can't be beat for tourists -- it's literally around the corner from Place Jacques-Cartier and a few blocks from the Metro. As a host, Yanick is a real pro. He was responsive, flexible with check-in/checkout time, and left a fully stocked bathroom. The loft is beautiful, clean, and modern. Full of light. A+, would book again. Thanks Yanick!",10.0
"I had a great experience in Montreal. 

Yanick was very friendly and had a beautiful apartment. I texted him with any questions I had and he responded right away. The apartment is located in Old Port and on St Paul Street where the apartment is full of life - restaurants and bars galore.",10.0
"Yanick's loft is just as described in the listing--right in the middle of Old Port section of Old Montreal, just steps from the Bonsecours Market and many pleasant restaurants and shops and convenient to the Metro. It's a bustling area, very pedestrian friendly--but quiet enough late at night to sleep with open windows. The place is small but not at all cramped. He has a lovely, up-to-date kitchen with a fabulous Nespresso maker, and he left the refrigerator stocked with water, juice and milk. Yanick is quite personable and welcoming. I arrived earlier than expected and he was most gracious about the mixup. He was also available by text when I needed to ask  where he stored a couple of household items.",10.0
"Yanick's place was perfect for our quick getaway! Right in the heart of Old Montreal, we were a few steps away from numerous bars, restaurants, shops and the water. Everything we wanted to do and see was within walking distance. Leading up to our arrival, Yanick was extremely helpful – he always got back to me the day I emailed him. He provided us with great information regarding parking and places to eat! We will definitely use Yanick again if we return to Montreal!",10.0
"Yanick was an excellent host. Communication was excellent. 

Having lived in Montreal, I have to say the location is excellent. 

One thing we noticed on our first night there was that the bed sheets were not freshly laundered. The problem was solved by replacing them with fresh sheets. Perhaps it was an oversight. 

The bed sinks in the middle, but that's us being picky. 

$18.50 per day parking needs to be taken into consideration; luckily the parking facility was nearby. 

Internet went down on our second day, though not likely Yanick's fault. 

Good place to stay.",10.0

"Yanick's place is fantastic. It's next door to my favorite restaurant in Old Port, Jardin Nelson, and steps away from all the fun Old Montreal has to offer!

The apartment was beautiful, spacious, and clean. There were nice hospitality touches such as lavender shampoo and conditioner, and no shortage of towels and washcloths. The bed was comfortable, and the Wifi was fast. The place had great temperature controls, Yanick had the AC on before we arrived so it was comfortable right away. We didn't use the kitchen because we were only there one night, but the set up was beautiful as well as functional and would have been perfect for dining in if we needed to. 

About the host: Yanick saved my trip - all our other accommodations and plans had fallen through - Yanick's message to me that he would be able to meet us early to drop off our bags was a beam of sun in a very gloomy situation! He was friendly and so welcoming when we arrived, he let us leave our things while he finished turning the place over after his previous guests left - and he also let us leave our things when we checked out so we didn't have to carry them around the city all day before departing for good. 

We didn't have any problems but he was quick to reach via text for questions that came up. A perfect host! I only hope his place is available next time we come back!",10.0

The loft itself is very cozy, comfortable, and clean with nice views of the historical buildings nearby.

I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Montreal!",10.0
Lovely and very clean apartment in the best part of the city. Great communication with Yanick. Highly recommend!,10.0
"I had a very good experience staying in Yanick's place. It's located on one of the most attractive old streets where you can visit one of the small restaurants or just take a walk. What was important for me was that Old Port is nearby and also a pickup point for excursions to Quebec is a 2-minute walk away. At night, it's not noisy at all; there's no music from the street. The Wi-Fi worked without problems. I recommend this apartment for anyone looking for a convenient location to explore old Montreal.",10.0

"Yanick was a wonderful host. I arrived to Montreal much earlier than anticipated, and he made sure I had a place to drop off my bags and explore the city while the loft was being prepared, which was ready for me ahead of schedule. 

He also ensured coffee and more than basic staples were available when I arrived. The apartment was clean, spacious, and comfortable. Ideal for meeting up with friends and going out in Montreal, while taking some time between events to separate from the group and finish some work.

It was right in the middle of the life of Vieux Port, yet quiet: I will really miss that. It was perfect for getting focused work done (WiFi was on point too) so I could enjoy my trip afterwards and ideal for winding down after a day of exploring. For anyone that stays here, I highly recommend exploring the neighboring art galleries: my mind was blown by some of the art there. I would stay here again, and I can't wait to plan my next trip.",10.0

"Yanick has been an excellent host from the moment I messaged him to make a reservation. His response time for any of our requests was very quick. We let him know we were traveling from the NYC area, so we would be arriving late, and he was very flexible with us on that. In fact, when we hit traffic and got lost and arrived an hour after our expected time, he accommodated us. Upon arrival, the loft was in perfect condition. He took time to show us where everything was, how things worked, and walked me back to my car to show me where the garage was to park. The loft is such a gem of a find! The location is perfect for first-time Montreal visitors because it's in the heart of Old Port. The streets surrounding are bustling with lively restaurants, shops, and history. Anything we wanted to do was within walking distance, so we didn't have to move our car much. The views from the loft were gorgeous, overlooking the port and attractions in town.

"A truly memorable experience, from Yanick greeting us upon arrival to its convenient location and amenities within the unit (really comfortable bedding/sheets)...this apartment is everything you need and more. 
It is perfectly situated in Old Montréal. It was very convenient for my husband and I to get around and explore for a few days. 
Most of all, Yanick was super helpful and very gracious with setting us up with some breakfast starters (milk, cheese, egg, bread...WOW!) Very yummy coffee provided too which made our mornings much easier :) 
If you're looking for an excellent host with an excellent place, look no further...you've already discovered it.

"Yanick was incredibly accommodating and responsive. He answered all of our questions quickly, and he made himself available to address our concerns.  He is the perfect host.

His place is in a great location and it's only a short walk away from a bunch of bars, restaurants, and stores. My two brothers and I spent the weekend there and it was amazing. I will definitely book this place (if it's available) the next time I am heading to Montreal.",10.0
"This place is incredible! It is simple but tasteful, the bed was very comfortable, and the location could not have been better (on the fourth floor of a building that opens directly onto the cobblestone streets of the historic district centered around Rue St. Paul.) We had a glorious breakfast every morning with the eggs and orange juice provided by Yanick, and made delicious lattes with the cappuccino machine available. The place is between one quarter and one half mile to Champ-de-Mars metro station and right across the street from the magnificent City Hall building. As long as you don't need tons of space, you will not regret booking this spot!",10.0
"Yanick's place in Vieux Montreal was wonderful. It was a tiny, charming space right on the main street in the tourist district. I loved the wood beams and the decor and the location couldn't have been better. It was great to be in a building with an elevator, since the place was on the fourth floor. Parking was pretty close by. I love Montreal and really enjoyed staying at Yanick's place. I would definitely recommend it to anyone else looking to visit Montreal.",10.0
Awesome location and awesome loft! The host was very accommodating and friendly. Would love to stay here again!,10.0

"Yanick's apartment was perfect and in the perfect location. Yanick is very responsive to any questions and met us at the apartment to explain everything. He provided everything for breakfast in case you needed it (cereal, milk, bread, eggs) and also has a Nespresso machine for you to use if you want to make yourself something. There's pretty much everything within 5 minutes of Yanick's place and even better you can open the windows to hear live music. Would definitely recommend staying here.",10.0
"Yanick's apartment was cozy, clean, and in a wonderful location. The bed was very comfortable, and we had everything we needed. In fact, even more because there was coffee, bread, cereal, eggs, milk, and other staples that we were free to consume which we thought was a lovely bonus. Yanick was very friendly and promptly replied when contacted. He was waiting for us when we arrived. Everything was perfect, and we would definitely stay here again. Thank you so much, Yanick! We loved your place!",10.0
"Yanick made me feel welcome right away. He came with groceries and water and showed me how to work the espresso machine as well as the TV. The place is beautiful and really could not be in a more perfect location in Old Montreal!

Yanick made it feel like a home away from home and I would definitely come stay here again or recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal!",10.0

Yanick gave me a tour of the place, including how to use the TV, set up WiFi, how to use the Nespresso Machine, where the laundry was, etc., and he even had offerings of groceries for breakfast. I used the kitchen to cook several meals—a kitchen that is fully equipped with pots, pans, spices, utensils, etc.—and found myself right at home. The loft itself is absolutely stunning, and in an ideal location. It was quiet, comfortable, and a perfect size for my 4 days there. Every evening, I enjoyed live music in the central plaza, seen from the windows. I absolutely will be staying here again in the future. I can't thank you enough, Yanick, for the hospitality. Your place is a gem.",10.0

"Summary: Quite frankly, I prefer to stay here than in a hotel. Great location, very clean apartment, helpful and friendly host.

Location: Located right in Old Montreal where the major tourist spots are. About 5 to 10-minute walk from closest metro and bus stations.

Apartment: The apartment itself was in a very clean and tidy condition. Almost everything from towels, to kitchenware and utensils, to free laundry... had all been meticulously prepared for you.  The only minus was that the A/C was not functioning properly during my stay, so it felt slightly hot during the day, but still tolerable since Montreal was getting cold at night during my stay anyway.

Host: Mr. Yanick was very friendly and very quick in replying when I needed help with directions in Montreal. Great host overall!",10.0
"Upon my arrival, Yannick was waiting to explain the details and amenities of the loft. He was very courteous and the accommodation exceeded my expectations. It was very beautiful, very clean, and had many amenities and equipment, even coffee and breakfast were included, which was very appreciated. Given the rainy weather, the Wi-Fi cable was convenient. The bed was very comfortable. The location of the accommodation is ideal and on a street in Old Montreal that is close to everything. I have no negative comments.",10.0
"This was my first time visiting beautiful city Montreal.

And which made my little trip more perfect was this place where I stayed.

First, the best thing about the place is its location. You can't find anywhere better than here. It's just across the old port and just a few steps from Place Jacques Cartier. I enjoyed walking nearby every day. 

And Bixi is just across the street if you are a fan of biking.

Second, the best thing about the house itself was that it was very clean, with a cute kitchen that had everything you needed. Although I don't cook much, you will definitely find it comfortable to use. Nice and clean bed and bathrooms, etc. 

Third, the host was very attentive. He explained about the place and greeted me when I arrived. You can see how attentive he is when you stay there; he prepared little things in the house for you.

It was a great experience for me, and I am very glad that I made the decision to stay here for 10 days.",10.0

"Yanick was an excellent host. He answered questions right away as they arose during our stay, and checked in to make sure everything was okay. The apartment was quiet, serene, and a nice temperature, which I was concerned might be an issue visiting in mid-November— instead it felt great. It's a cozy and straightforward studio but has all the amenities you would need. The kitchen was nicely stocked, and the water pressure in the shower of the clean bathroom was fantastic. The location was ideal, close to the port and steps away from tons of good food. I would definitely consider coming back.",10.0
"Yanick's communication was excellent, we were booked almost immediately and he was great at setting up our check-in. The apartment is all yours. It's a perfect studio setup for a couple, with a full kitchen stocked with most things you could want and a fridge full of water, milk, eggs, cheese, etc. Thanks Yanick! The bed is super comfortable, the Wifi is good, and the bathroom is super clean. The location is GREAT! Right across from the Bonsecours Market and right on Rue St. Paul; it's hard to find a better spot if you're looking to explore Old Montreal's shops, restaurants, and nightlife. Close to Place d'Armes and Champ-de-Mars subway stops if you want to check out other areas of the city as well. Can't wait to come back. :)",10.0

"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful stay at Yanick's loft. We were met by Patrick who was a terrific and responsive host. He helped us carry our bags into the loft, provided local activity information and gave us a tour of the loft's amenities.

Shopping, dining, museums, cathedrals and galleries are mere steps away on Rue St. Paul. You will be in the center of everything.",10.0

"As I only spent a total of 7 hours at Yanick's place (arrived late and had to leave early for a breakfast meeting), I didn't get to thoroughly soak in the ambience of his loft suite in Vieux Montreal. The bed was comfy and the place was clean with all the amenities one would need - I especially loved the high quality towels. His place would be ideal for someone wanting to authentically experience living in Vieux Montreal. I was very impressed with Yanick's prompt level of response and how he went out of his way to make sure I got in when my train arrived late.",10.0

Nice and clean, well-appointed, and Yanick is a great host. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and made exploring Old Montreal a blast. The only downside is the lack of parking in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) biggie though coz there was pay parking just a block away from the apartment. We ended up paying $40 for 2 full days, not bad at all I think. All in all I highly recommend Yanick's place, it was just perfect!!!",10.0
"I have nothing bad to say about the place or Yanick. The place is so absolutely adorable and very clean.

"It was my first time renting with Airbnb and my first time in Montreal as well.  I have to say that Yanick's place was 10 times better than what I expected. The location is within walking distance of some of the best tourist spots, even if I had only spent a day there I would have left home happy. The loft is cozy and all the amenities that Yanick provides make you feel at home. He provides breakfast from fresh eggs, coffee, a variety of cereals, fruit, and the list goes on and on. For me it was so easy to be able to wake up and have those items available to start the day as it is something that I am use to having available in my home. His home is exceptionally clean which makes you feel as if you are staying at a high-end hotel chain. His recommendations on where to visit Montreal turned into my official tour guide. One of the reasons I wanted to visit Montreal was because I had heard such great things regarding the city and people. We are happy that our stay at Yanick's was proof that the city and the people are absolutely MARVELOUS!!!",10.0

"Yanick is a special host in the Airbnb community. I have stayed at many places on Airbnb over the past 5 years. This has to be the best valued Airbnb I've ever been in. Yanick provides all the urban amenities needed, and special touches throughout the studio. One of the best features of this studio in fall is the live music outside the window in the public square. When I was in the studio, I left the windows open (in autumn) and listened to the street performances nearby. The studio was warm, homemade, comfortable, cozy, and fully stocked.

"Yanick was a very nice man. He met with us when we arrived and provided more than we needed. There was food in the apartment which saved us some money, and everything worked well. One thing to note is the fact that there are no nearby places to buy beer at a wholesale value, meaning there are only bars and restaurants around the apartment. We had to walk over fifteen minutes away to find a place that sold beer (it was in Little China). Other than that, the stay was pretty much perfect, although like Yanick said, the apartment was a little small for four people. Although we managed just fine.",10.0

We would have liked to know that this was actually a studio because one bedroom is specified in the listing. However, as it is actually a studio, the bed is in the living room. 

Therefore, we hear the noise of the refrigerator at night intermittently.
The bed located in a corner is not easily accessible for the second person. 
If you are renting in January, it's best to check the dates of the ""Igloofest"" electronic music festival which takes place on Thursday, Friday and Saturday two weeks in January because we hear some sounds from the stage.",10.0

He was very good about making sure everything was perfect and was kind enough to text me during my stay to make sure I had everything I needed.

"Perfect location. Minutes from the subway, restaurants, and shops. Cozy and comfortable space. I would definitely stay there again.",10.0
"Yanick was a wonderful host! His place is adorable and the location is perfect. It's an easy walk all throughout Old Port, with great access to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and historical landmarks. The apartment has every amenity you would need and Yanick's communication prior to check-in was superb. Looking forward to booking this place again for future visits :)",10.0
I highly recommend Yanick's place. He is very nice and his place is located in one of the best locations in Montreal.,10.0
"Yanick was a fantastic host, very quick to respond and accommodating, and his place was great. I had been a bit concerned from the photos that it might be chilly being an older place that looked a bit like a converted attic, but when I arrived it was nicely warm and I didn't have to make any temperature adjustments. The place is very private and secure, with the extra benefit of a keyed common entry and keyed private entry. I had expected something like a single room in a hostel-like setting, but it's actually more like a hotel including an elevator. All the photos are accurate and the location is great - easily walkable distances to explore the city. This was my best Airbnb experience yet and I would definitely stay again.",10.0
This is the place to be. Loved every minute of the trip. The location is in an exciting part of Montreal as well.,10.0
This place is just pretty cool. It's right in the old part of Montreal. We really enjoyed our time here.,10.0
This is an exquisite location! It was perfect for walking distance to several wonderful sightseeing destinations. It was really nice to have breakfast items and water left for me. I was very happy with my stay.,10.0
"My friend and I had such a lovely stay at Yanick's studio apartment in Montreal. It was clean, comfortable, and he generously provided an array of breakfast foods and cooking staples (oil, vinegar) and amenities to actually cook dinner too (which we did). The neighborhood felt extremely safe. Thank you so much for hosting us, Yanick.",10.0
"Excellent location, 5 minutes from the metro and in the Old Town. Excellent value for money. Friendly welcome, the fridge was stocked with breakfast items! Many thoughtful touches from Yannick, a very clean and comfortable apartment. I recommend it! Ideal for one or two people.",10.0
"First off, Yanick's description of the location is spot-on! His loft is located right on St. Paul Street in the heart of the old town. If you want the European experience without going overseas, then this is the spot.  Yanick's loft is wonderful. It's comfortable and well appointed with anything you may need if you forget to pack something :-) As a host he was kind enough to wait for us when we were arriving late (which we very much appreciated) and he gave us some good tips on the surrounding area. Finally, you cannot beat the value. What Yanick offers is unbelievable at the price - you cannot go wrong here.",10.0
Nice place near everything!,10.0
"Yanick was a wonderful host, and his home was so beautiful and in the perfect location. We loved everything about it and it really made our trip special!",10.0
"Cozy studio apartment with all the amenities needed to comfortably spend a day indoors or return to rest after a busy day of exploring. The neighborhood is quiet and very peaceful at night. We enjoyed being removed from the liveliness of downtown at the end of a busy day. We didn't spend a great deal of time in Old Montreal as we found it expensive and preferred to explore the more culturally diverse areas of Montreal. It was easy to walk to most of the areas that we had more interest in exploring. Overall, Yanick's home was cozy with lots of extras (Nespresso, fruits, milk, eggs, cereal, etc). It was very clean and Yanick was responsive and punctual. We weren't left waiting for him to arrive and greet us after our long drive, which we appreciated.",10.0
"The apartment is great, perfect location, 5 minutes walking to the metro, 10 minutes to Notre-Dame, and 2 minutes from the Ferris wheel. Despite being a very touristy area, it's very quiet at night, perfect for relaxing! The apartment had cereals, coffee, juice, and yogurt! It's worth every penny!",10.0
"Lovely apartment, walking distance from all the tourist attractions but also very quiet and fully equipped, if you ever want to escape the crowd and spend an evening at home. The perfect place to explore old Montreal! Also, Yanick is a great host: he's always available and flexible about my check-in and check-out time.",10.0
"Yanick's place is a cozy studio apartment near everything in Old Montreal. You can't beat this location. Open the door, and you're in front of Marche Bonsecours. It's perfect for two people. Everything you need to cook a meal is in the kitchen and the bathroom has everything you forgot to bring. Yanick was there to greet us when we arrived to show us around and explain the Nespresso machine to us (which we needed). The water bottles and coffee he provided came in handy! We would definitely stay here again.",10.0

Great location - Host was easy to communicate with. Handsome decor. Just loved it,10.0
"This was our first Airbnb experience and I’m glad it went smoothly. Our host, Yanick is very nice. 
The place is very clean. Plenty of hot water and excellent water pressure. The location is perfect, everything is close by, you are right on Old Montreal East.

We are so thankful for the breakfast items provided as we could not find a restaurant nearby that served breakfast (we only checked the street of St. Paul), so we went back to our room and made egg sandwiches, yum!

We will definitely be back and would definitely recommend this place! ❤️",10.0
"This place is amazing. We can't fault it! A beautiful apartment right in the middle of the old part of town - so accessible. Teena brought us everything we needed for breakfast and made us very welcome when we arrived. Oh, and the shower was probably the best one I've ever had (website hidden by Airbnb) powerful! There's a lot of thought that's been put into this listing and it really all adds up to make a perfect stay!",10.0
"Surrounded by history and culture, Yanick's place is in a perfect location in Old Montreal. There are countless restaurants, bars, galleries and churches nearby (within five minutes or less), and Ste-Catherine is only a 15-minute walk away. Yanick was kind enough to stay up and let us in well after his regular check-in time—great host.",10.0
"This is a very cute little apartment in the heart of all the action of Old Montreal. The location literally could not have been better as it is at the back of the building (so it is quiet), but only steps from great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. Yanick is a great host. He not only provides sightseeing tips, but umbrellas, bottled water, high-end coffee, and breakfast items. We truly enjoyed our stay and will be back.",10.0
Excellent location. Walkable to everything. Very clean apartment. Nice extras in the fridge for breakfast.,10.0
"Beautiful space and AMAZING location! Yanick is such a thoughtful host. He was there to explain everything when I checked in and was very understanding when my flights to Montreal were delayed three times and I checked in very late. The place is very clean and tidy, and the bed and pillows are very comfortable. I would love to stay there again when I'm in Montreal. Beautiful eats around the apartment and it's very close to all the tourist destinations in the city. Loved my stay!",10.0
"Our stay at Yanick's was wonderful!

"The location of Yanick's sweet little loft was incredibly convenient for exploring. We didn't take our car out of the garage once we arrived, walking to great sights to see, places to shop, and of course, great food. A very comfortable bed after a day full of activity was a huge plus. If we get a chance to visit Montreal again in the near future, I'd certainly hope The Loft would be available.",10.0

"If you have never been to old historic Montréal, this is the place in the heart of it.
The metro is within walking distance, clean, and will take you SAFELY to Park Mont Royal, large, green, and safe (bus 11) or the botanical gardens. Walk downtown, eat in Chinatown, shop on rue St. Catherine. Airport taxis take you to the front door, literally, for $30 USD.

The location is perfect, right in the heart of Montreal's Old Port area, within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and shops. We always had bottles of water, Nespresso coffee, cereal, juice, yogurt, fruit... the host was very attentive and concerned with details. I would stay there again on my next trip.",10.0
We enjoyed our stay very much. The thoughtful amenities and breakfast options were appreciated. We liked the wooden floors.,10.0

The place was clean and cozy. I highly recommend his place if you travel alone or with 1 to 2 others.",10.0
Convenient location and very clean!,10.0
"This is a fabulous little apartment in a dream location. Right in the heart of Old Montreal, you're surrounded by places to explore, restaurants to dine at, and walks along the waterfront. The kitchen was such a treat, so well stocked - I saved money and time by eating at home occasionally. And the style, with those beams!, was excellent. Couldn't have been happier.",10.0

"This loft is in a great location. We stayed two nights and enjoyed the space and Netflix in the evening after spending all day walking and eating our way through Montreal's charming neighborhoods. 

The directions to the loft were excellent and Yanick was waiting for us to check in when we arrived early.
Check out was straightforward too.

Would recommend this for a romantic getaway.",10.0

"Best Airbnb I have stayed in! Can't beat the location if you want to see Vielle Ville. On the oldest street in the city. Everything was superb in the space—all I needed plus quality soaps/options/bath products/tea/Nespresso machine, soft sheets, eggs, cheese, cereal, more than I’ve seen in a typical Airbnb. Well-designed space, comfortable, amazing views from the window.  I just might go back!",10.0

All in all, this was one of the best Airbnbs I stayed at, and I would love to come back and stay here on my next visit to Montreal.",10.0
"I was very busy at a conference during my week-long stay, so I hope to stay there again sometime.

Really great!!!",10.0
"Great host, great location, great apartment!",10.0
"Yanick's place was absolutely wonderful. As soon as you walk in, you're in a much larger loft than the pictures can show. There were nice breakfast amenities during the stay, as well as the place being very clean. Lastly, the location is mere steps from just about everything in Vieux Montréal, and even then, public transportation and the more hip downtown are within a 10-20 minute walk.",10.0

"Our first night we walked to the port to ice skate, then to a great little brasserie for dinner and music. It was so nice to have both at our fingertips. The location was out of the way for the heavy tourism which made for nice and quiet nights. 

The mattress is firm, so please take that into account if it matters to you. 

Thanks for a nice clean apartment during our stay in Montreal!",10.0

Located two steps from the metro and Mont Royal Avenue, perfect for all shopping! 
Very clean. Highly recommend!",9.0
"My host, Zaki, was welcoming and responsive.  I had a very late arrival (close to midnight) and he was there to greet me and show me to the place. The place was just as it was described and was away from street noise and quiet which was great when I needed to sleep. The place is situated in a great spot with easy access to the metro and Bixi bike rental, which I used. Cafes and places to eat are a block away. Overall it was a great experience, with a great host, in a great place!",9.0
"Lovely apartment, sparkling clean, well equipped and with a super comfy bed! Well located on a pretty street very close to the Metro, it doesn't overlook the street so very quiet (not that it's a noisy street!) Great to have a laundry room right next to the flat - $1 each for wash and dry. Fast wifi. We loved it there. Highly recommended!",9.0
"Very well-located apartment on the plateau, and incredibly quiet. Parking is very easy to find nearby. Excellent communication with the owner. Ideal for a couple's weekend getaway, but the space is limited; I would hesitate to stay there longer unless alone. I recommend it if you plan to enjoy the neighborhood.",9.0
Very nice neighborhood close to all amenities.,9.0
"The host arranged for his brother to be waiting for us at the door with the keys. It was very convenient. The neighborhood is central to the plateau in Montreal, and yet it was quite quiet...just as advertised.",9.0
"Very accommodating! We arrived late and Zaki was very nice and patient. The apartment was true to the photos and in a great location! The host was very helpful. We stayed one night, there was free parking out front. It worked out great!",9.0
"Really great location!
Close to the metro and Bixi bike is on the corner of the street!
Mont Royal was a really nice neighborhood and with being polite to everyone about not speaking French, the hospitality industry was happy to speak English with a polite attitude.
Zaki was able to meet us before our stay and let us know any small details about the place, a clean and tidy apartment perfect for two for a week getaway!
Would come back to stay here in a heartbeat! :)",9.0
Translation: It was easy and awesome!,9.0
Zaki very kindly met up with us to deliver the keys and gave us a few tips on where to go to enjoy the neighborhood. We loved the street and the neighborhood where Zaki's place was! The apartment was comfortable and had basic amenities such as towels and wifi. Highly recommended place for a weekend getaway to true Montreal!,9.0
"The place was everything we needed. It's a nice quiet neighborhood with street parking. Zaki helped us understand the parking signs. The kitchen was equipped with what we needed to enjoy our market goodies. The porch pictured faces the back yard, which allowed us to sleep with the doors open and screen closed. I suggest bringing dvds or a tablet for movies because there is no cable. There are many bars and restaurants you can easily walk to. Great stay!",9.0
"Zaki has been phenomenal.

"Zaki's place was great! Very clean, comfortable and quiet, and exactly what we needed. Zaki was very easy to deal with and always quick to respond to any questions we had. He was very accommodating with check-in/check-out times and the neighborhood is amazing! So close to the metro and lots of great coffee shops, bars and restaurants right around the corner. Would stay here again for sure! Highly recommend!",9.0
"I loved the location, near subway and restaurants and bars. The stairs to the door were very steep and not suitable for elders or drunks. The unit was not bright or cheery. The TV should have cable TV or at least HD cables for your computer. Also toilet paper would be a bonus!",9.0
"Zakis apartment was clean and functional, although a bit sparsely decorated. It was a great place for us to crash during a weekend in Montreal, as we could walk to all the best bars, restaurants, and boutiques in and around Le Plateau and Mile End within 35 minutes. In fact, we hardly left the area except for a shorter visit to the old city. The check-in process could have been smoother as we had not received adequate information on which floor or apartment was assigned to us, however, Zaki was quick to reply when we texted for more info and was very flexible regarding our stay.",9.0
"Very friendly place to stay, true to the description. Zaki was particularly accommodating and very nice. 

The only small downside is the bedding which didn't seem to have been changed despite fees being charged for that. 

Access is via a colossal staircase, so bring an extra strong friend if you have any suitcases to carry up.",9.0
"The apartment is very well located in the Plateau neighborhood. The metro is right outside and the neighborhood is full of restaurants and bars. 

Access to the apartment is simple. Everything you need is present, everything was clean and comfortable.

We didn't get a chance to meet Zaki but he remained available and responsive to our messages. 

I highly recommend it!",9.0
"The apartment is exactly as seen in the pictures. The location of the place is superb, a 5-minute walk from Mont Royal station and in the midst of a great cafe/restaurant scene. There are multiple gems on the side streets of Mont Royal Rue too! Overall, we had a great time in Montreal and this place was exactly as we expected!

For future guests:

It's a no-frills, basic place with most amenities. The cable TV does not work and there were no toiletries - so bring your own shampoo and soap! Per previous reviews, the steps leading up to the apartment are extremely steep, so it is difficult if you have a large suitcase.",9.0
"Very close to the metro. There are some excellent local diners in the area. Zaki was very easy to reach. We had some internet problems when we first arrived due to a snowstorm, but he fixed them as soon as he could. The TV didn't turn on, but we didn't really need it. Overall, great stay.",9.0
"When we arrived at Zaki's place the temperature was about -10 degrees Fahrenheit. The apartment heated up quickly and was very cozy. It is clean, simple, and well-equipped. Some amenities we appreciated were two bedside lamps, hooks in the bathroom, and an extra comforter for the bed. The apartment is in an excellent location--near Avenue Mont Royal, Rue Rachel, and Rue du Duluth. There are so many appealing restaurants nearby. It is also very close to the beautiful Parc La Fontaine. We had planned to be out and about far more than we were, but due to the frigid temperatures, we were inside quite a bit and it was so comfortable and pleasant. We hope to be back!",9.0
"This is a great location in Montreal. Close to great restaurants and not far from downtown. Zaki was great and made it very easy to check in and out. The apartment was very clean and much more cost than a hotel. Couple things to note, parking is a problem as street parking is for permit holders so you risk getting a ticket. Also the tv didn't work for us. It turned on but we couldn't switch the media source to use the DVD player. Wasn't a big deal as we were only there for the night but something to note for longer stays. All around a great place to stay. Thank you Zaki!!",9.0
"The neighborhood is amazing. We walked everywhere - lots of cafes, shops, etc. The street is also nice and very typical of Le Plateau. It's a stretch to call the apartment ""Grand Luxe"" as it's very basic and functional. It would have been helpful to have better instructions for the lockbox as we had lots of difficulty getting into the apartment. The TV didn't work for us and there were no instructions for the WiFi, but it was clean and quiet.",9.0
"Zaki's studio apartment was clean and cozy when we arrived. It's small but has everything you need. It's in a multi-unit building, but it was very quiet. And the location is terrific!—very close to the Mont-Royal metro station and St-Denis street so you have quick access to the whole city.  And there are plenty of great places to eat right in the neighborhood as well. 

Parking is on the street which can be a challenge, as per usual for Montreal. Just read the signs closely and be prepared to park a couple of blocks away. 

Zaki was very gracious to me about my stilted French and we managed to communicate well, so don't worry if you're not a French speaker. My husband and I highly recommend booking with Zaki. Merci mille fois, Zaki!",9.0
"The apartment was ideal for a weekend in Montreal. It is well-equipped and clean, though not ""luxurious"" as described. The neighborhood is charming and vibrant, but the apartment is peaceful.",9.0
"Zaki was an amazing host! Incredibly responsive and very helpful. The apartment was perfect, clean, and in the best location in Montreal! Highly recommend!",9.0
The studio was as described. A perfect place for exploring Montreal and feeling relaxed and comfortable after a long day touring. We found the studio to be in a very quiet area. The neighborhood was pleasant and refreshing. Zaki had left great instructions on making arrangements for the keys. No problems at all and no surprises. Everything required was available in the studio.,9.0
"Great, comfortable little spot. Excellent location. Clean. Zaki was easy to contact via messaging. Would definitely stay again in a heartbeat.",9.0
"Pleasant studio, quiet and well-located on the plateau between Mont-Royal metro station and ""La Banquise,"" a must-visit for poutine lovers.  Please note that access to the interior courtyard is not permitted. Zaki is easily reachable and always has a solution. However, there was a slight inconvenience: the minimum amount needed to make coffee or tea upon arrival was not guaranteed. We had to resort to the convenience store, which was the only downside to our short stay at Zaki's place.  Zaki's apartment is highly recommended.",9.0
"We didn't see or meet Zaki which was fine as we were busy. The place was pretty clean although the corners had dust and the cracks of the chairs had crumbs. One block form the Metro station with bixi bikes even closer. Galley kitchen with pots, pans, glasses, cutlery etc but no supplies (salt, pepper, sugar, oil etc.) Good for reheating leftovers or pre made meals. It was quiet as it's in the back of the building although there is only one window, the sliding door in the bedroom, and when the heat exchanger for the building is running it is fairly loud as it's directly below the door. When we were there the screen door was unusable, just leaning against the side of the building and the garbage can was full, stinky and 3 feet from the sliding bedroom door. Fortunately it wasn't really hot while we were there so we only had to close the door once because of the stink. I noticed a bike rack in the backyard, good spot if you brought your own bikes although at $100/night you're probably going to spend another $5/day for a bixi pass if you want to bike.",9.0
"Great location, clean and great price.  Really tough to beat. I didn't get a chance to meet Zaki, but he was responsive and a great host. 

Highly recommended if you're traveling solo or as a couple.",9.0
"Very good stay in Montreal and Zaki's apartment was a lot for many people. Faithful to the description, it is clean and has everything necessary for the first day. In a quiet and silent building. The only noise of the morning is the song of birds from the back courtyard. Quite pleasant. Zaki was very clear about key handover and very responsive when I had questions. I will return to Montreal, I will stay at Zaki's again.",9.0
"The room was clean and in a nice area, but don't be deceived by the street view; it's very small and quite hot, only a fan which barely helped and a TV with no service, just a DVD player and no selection. I guess you get what you pay for. Also, there are very steep stairs to access. Good value for young people with little luggage.",9.0
"Earlier this month, we stayed in the studio apartment in the Plateau neighborhood of Montreal (hosted by Zaki). We loved the charm of the building and neighborhood (and the cleanliness of the apt).  The studio apt. was the right size for two of us who were more interested in exploring Montreal than staying around in an apt. The apt. is a short walk to the Metro station (at Mont Royal) and a short walk from MANY dining and entertainment options. Zaki even recommended a couple of places for dinner (we chose the ""best poutine in Montreal"" spot). We knew that the apt. didn't have air conditioning (as stated) but we were disappointed that the only screened opening in this interior apt. was broken. If you are thinking of visiting in the heat of summer, this is less than ideal. The other issue that people traveling by car have to be aware of is the lack of parking in this entire area. There is free parking in limited spots but it is only for certain times of day, so we either had to hang around the neighborhood jumping from spot to spot or risk getting a ticket (they don't tow)...we got ticketed (but were lucky because we only received one ticket in a two-day period). But, even though there were some issues to deal with, we loved the feeling of being a part of this active Montreal neighborhood. P.S. The eclairs at the bakery in Sherbrooke were the best!!",9.0
"Comfortable and clean place to stay. Many amazing places to eat within a 5-minute walk from the location. The main ""downtown"" area of Montreal was about a 40-minute walk away.

Parking: there is a spot for about 4 cars right in front of the building where you can park most days and overnight (minus the few hours on the day listed on the street parking sign). 

The host was wonderful with responses. The only thing missing was that we ran out of toilet paper during our 2-night stay because there weren't any extra in the apartment. The host apologized that he hadn't gotten a chance to restock before our arrival.",9.0
"Very well located housing in a very lively neighborhood, close to the metro and shops, while still being pleasant to live in. The landlord was very accommodating with the hours, thank you!",9.0

"The apartment was absolutely perfect for a weekend in the city. Everything was clean, and the check-in process was quite smooth. The location couldn't have been better.

10/10, would recommend. Thanks, Zaki!",9.0

"The apartment is exactly as described. It is very, very well located in a neighborhood we have greatly enjoyed.

We stayed there for 6 nights during Christmas and were charmed by it. If we were to return to Montreal in winter, we would definitely rebook it, and this makes us want to go back in the summer.",9.0

"Incredible apartment. We couldn't have found a more perfect place to stay in Montreal. We were close to great restaurants, the neighborhood was great, and the apartment was very clean!",9.0
Well-located apartment with a great value for money.,9.0
"This apartment is amazing for up to 2 people for an indefinite amount of time. The location is amazing, 1 block in any direction to food and sights. The bed is comfortable, with plenty of space in the bedroom. Full bathroom and kitchen, with a breakfast table that was more than you need for a trip where the main purpose is to binge eat! Quiet apartment, never heard or saw any neighbors, and the street is mostly families so no problems with rowdy folks. Multiple ""out-of-town"" parking spaces located right in front, just read the signs on the street! Easy check-in/check-out/Great communication! We would/are absolutely going to stay here again!",9.0
"Zaki was wonderful to stay with. We never actually met, but he helped out on very short notice when our other Airbnb messed us around... His communication was great and everything about the place was as advertised. Easy and convenient for us and we were able to secure a parking spot right in front of the apartment",9.0
"Pleasant, quiet and central location.",9.0
Ideal apartment for discovering Montreal. The metro is just 2 steps away. The neighborhood is arguably the most pleasant in the city. Nothing to complain about. Zaki is very nice and accommodating. Highly recommended,9.0
"The location was great! The apartment was clean for the most part, with the exception of a dirty towel hanging on the back of the bathroom door, no toilet paper upon arrival, and I also found some of other guests' hair on the bed linen (definitely not mine). The apartment has the basic amenities EXCEPT the wifi did not work at all. I reached out to Zaki and he said he was out of town and that he would call me the next day but I never received a phone call or any form of follow-up.",9.0
"Quiet studio in a good location.
No Wi-Fi or TV. No comfort items upon arrival (drinks, toilet paper, coffee, milk).
The owner was not present for 3 days. Communication was only by SMS.",9.0
"Zaki's apartment was just as described: clean, comfortable, and perfectly situated. It is just around the corner from a big park and a five-minute walk from the metro as well as the best areas in the city for shopping, eating, and going out. The kitchen had all the cooking utensils we needed to cook but wasn't stocked; if you plan on cooking, bring your salt and pepper, etc. There was an issue with the wifi before we arrived, but Zaki communicated with us and had the issue fixed shortly after we arrived.",9.0
"Zaki's place is quite nice. It is in a fantastic location! Very close to the Metro, restaurants, bars and shops but on a quiet street. Best of both worlds. Zaki was quite helpful with a couple problems that arose like letting me keep my bags there a few hours past check out.",9.0
This is a great studio. Everything you need for a comfortable retreat. It was surprisingly quiet given its central location. Just tucked away above a courtyard. I would definitely stay again.,9.0
"Quiet housing close to all amenities, shops, restaurants and public transport...

Ideal for 1 or 2 people without any physical problems due to the slope of the exterior staircase.

The kitchen and bathroom are blind rooms.",9.0
"We stayed in unit 3, and while it wasn't the worst place to stay, it wasn't great either. It's not a home. It looked like a full-time rental with essential needs met, but was not very clean.",9.0
"Excellent location on the Mount Royal plateau. Quiet apartment with good bedding. Pleasant bathroom.

It is a shame that the apartment is dark. The fan is insufficient during hot days... Air conditioning would be welcome.",9.0
"Comfortable and practical studio (laundry facilities in the building, very well-equipped kitchen and bathroom), very well located, close to the metro, shops, restaurants and a free swimming pool on Marie-Anne Street. The owner is very available. The neighborhood is very pleasant, perfect for strolling and admiring the houses and gardens and meeting Montrealers, always ready to chat with French speakers! Excellent conditions for accommodation for an excellent stay!",9.0
"Zaki's place was centrally located in a great neighborhood, and it was quiet at night. I appreciated having a fan in the apartment, as it could get stuffy in the evenings. We had a wonderful stay in Montreal!",9.0
"Great location, but there were a couple of issues which could easily be corrected by the host for future guests. 

The main problem was that the unit had no air conditioning and it was summertime hot, so we couldn't cool down the place - the net effect was two sleepless nights. I called the host and he texted me that there is no AC and will just have to sleep with the sliding doors open at night to the outside - there are no windows in the unit. There's a fan that we kept on, but it just blows hot air around. I tried a bucket of ice in front of the fan, but couldn't cool down the place.

The other issue is that, given a $40 cleaning fee, while the place looks clean, when I turned on the shower, the water backed up because of hair and gunk in the drain. Some towels didn't smell clean and the bedspread/sheets had some stains. Not a big deal, but when charging a $40 fee, it's not acceptable. 

Overall, we were mainly disappointed because it shouldn't cost the host much to have a small AC unit that can be turned on for hot days and nights, which would have made all the difference.",9.0
"We unfortunately found ourselves in a situation where our Airbnb was completely uninhabitable, but our host was not willing to provide a refund. On the evening of our arrival, we soon discovered that the bathtub faucets were in such disrepair that the water could not be turned off after use. As the tub filled up quickly with water from the broken faucet and a bad drain, we had to use kitchen pots to bail water out of the tub for 40 minutes until the host arrived. Although Zaki was immediately reachable by phone, we were unable to communicate our issue due to the language barrier. After hanging up to write to Zaki on the Airbnb app, he said he would come to the apartment in 20 minutes. He did arrive after 40 minutes.

He arrived and managed to turn the faucet off by jamming and twisting the shower head toggle and tap at the same time. Clearly, he knew the faucets were broken before but did not bother to fix it. Further, it seemed that he had broken the faucet even more in the process of turning the water off. So at this point, the hot water knob no longer worked and water could only come out of the bottom spout, and not the shower head. Then, Zaki tried to tell us that this was due to ""city work"" when clearly, anyone could look at the shower and tell that it was in bad shape to begin with. He then suggested we could shower by using the KITCHEN POTS to catch water and pour over ourselves. We told him that we were leaving and he agreed to refund us the rest of the trip (2 nights). Later, when Zaki had left, he messaged to tell us that he would only refund us $200 even though we paid $108 per night plus $100 in service fees and cleaning fees.  We ended up wasting the entirety of our first day and a half in Montreal dealing with the bathtub situation and filing a complaint with Airbnb customer service. Luckily, they were extremely helpful and got us the full refund. 

Another thing to note is that the apartment was not clean. There is a strong odor that is noticeable as soon as you walk in. The coffee maker used by the previous guest and was left dirty.",9.0
"Zaki's place was great - quiet, clean, just as advertised. Loved the neighborhood too.

Zaki was very attentive and quick to respond as well.",9.0
"It was a perfect location and a comfortable bed. I walked virtually everywhere I wanted to go (grocery stores, restaurants, bars, etc).",9.0
"Just for the neighborhood, it is a great place to stay. It is perfectly located on the Plateau Mont-Royal, near so many restaurants and hot spots, near the subway or within walking distance of downtown. The home itself is a bit small, but very clean and quiet. We had a few problems with the shower (hot water not closing), but we were warned by Zaki about it (even if a bit late: two hours before arrival). Except for these few details, we had a great weekend in Montreal!",9.0
My stay was great! Zaki always got back to me when I tried contacting him. Would definitely stay again!,9.0
"Zaki's studio is really very well located on the Plateau, close to the Mont Royal metro and many restaurants. 
The studio is good for sleeping (during the day it is very dimly lit). 
During our stay (3 nights), garbage cans were left abandoned in front of the house, which was quite messy compared to the rest of the street. 
We didn't see Zaki but he was available via messages and explained check-in/check-out very well. 
It's not a ""grand luxury"" studio, but rather good for a few nights.",9.0
Amazing location! Zaki responded to messages very quickly and solved our problem very soon.,9.0
"My accommodation is really well located, a 5-10 minute walk from the metro station. It's a bit shady, but very quiet, I didn't hear a single noise in 3 nights.

The neighborhood is interesting and has plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars, shops. It feels completely safe. Close to the center and subway stations, making it very convenient. Completely recommended. 

Thank you Véro for letting us stay in your lovely place!",9.0

"Vero welcomed us into her cozy and comfortable home with open arms, and we gladly fell into this place of warmth and well-being. Her workshop-style home is colorful and full of board games and books which kept us busy through the cold bleak storms of winter. She gave us great recommendations for local attractions (Drawn and Quarterly For the Win)  and Depaneur Cafe.

Overall, it was a lovely stay. Vero is awesome, very helpful, and very attentive to the needs of her guests. 5 stars",9.0
We loved staying at Vero's place! Vero was super communicative with us. We didn't get to meet her because of holiday travels but her friend met us at her place and gave us a ton of recommendations for where to go and showed us how to use the keys. The area was really nice and close to all the fun neighborhoods. We had a short stay but we were able to walk to all the different neighborhoods suggested to us (even in the snow!) and check out a lot of independent book stores and really great coffee places. The apartment is exactly as pictured and a very nice place to stay for the weekend. We hope to come back and possibly stay at Vero's workshop in the Village again!,9.0

"We didn't expect the location to be quite so far out of downtown, but that's on me. It helps to have a car to make the trips rather than taking a bus or train. 

Very comfortable room and bed and a very friendly and accommodating family home.

Speaking French is a big plus, but Jamal speaks very good English and he helped us a lot.

We did enjoy our stay.",8.0

"My friend and I rented the apartment for a weekend and we really enjoyed it. The location is great, close to downtown, but in a quiet neighborhood. The place is very clean and decorated with good taste, it shows that Ildiko enjoys taking care of it. The kitchen is spacious and has everything needed to cook. A large window and a wide patio door make for lots of sunshine. The bed is big enough for two and very comfortable. Ildiko provided clean sheets and towels. There was also more than enough closet space for us. Ildiko and her apartment definitely made our weekend in Montreal very enjoyable and hassle-free. Looking forward to visiting again.",9.0
"Hello, everything was as described, the accommodation was well-placed near the center, nothing special to say. Perfect as a ""base camp""",9.0

Very close to the subway and bus stop, and located a short walk from downtown (Berri-UQAM metro station), I highly recommend this place. Even though Ildiko was outside the city during our stay, we were perfectly well received. Our host, Glen, was courteous, polite and always available to answer all of our questions via text, email or phone. He was also very flexible with check-in and check-out times. He had prepared the apartment for us adequately with everything we needed to be comfortable. In addition, the value for money of the apartment is excellent as it's a very affordable rate. Thank you Ildiko and Glen!!!",9.0
"Very nice and warm place, near downtown, with a large supermarket nearby, we can find everything we need in the apartment.  Really good experience.",9.0
"There is much to say about this rental, what I don't understand is that the previous comments do not mention it despite the very good welcome from the Glèn, a friend of the host. The most important thing, cleanliness, despite appearances, the accommodation is dirty. Not just dirt from previous rentals but older. In addition, there is a strongly unpleasant odor that we were unable to get rid of from the kitchen. There is no mosquito net in the kitchen so as soon as you open the window, flies and mosquitoes come in. The mosquito net in the bedroom is pierced in several places and very difficult to close. The curtains in the kitchen or bedroom are either torn or dirty. There are no storage options provided in the room for storing our belongings, since all the chests of drawers are already filled with clothes belonging to the owner, which we find unusual. Despite its attractive price, we advise against renting this accommodation.",9.0
"Ildiko was a wonderful host! She wasn't able to accommodate us herself, but she made the proper arrangements to ensure everything went as smoothly as possible. The place was very clean and the location couldn't have been better; it was exactly what we were looking for. I would definitely consider booking with Ildiko again when I am in the area.",9.0

"The accommodation matches the description and photos. Two metro stations are accessible within a 10-15 minute walk. The only downside is that the neighborhood is residential, with supermarkets and convenience stores located 15-20 minutes away by foot from the apartment. However, the neighborhood is very pleasant to stroll in during summer. A convenience store is located just 2 minutes from the apartment but this isn't enough for a proper meal.",9.0

Free parking was always available on the street. The neighborhood was quiet and away from the bustle of the city, yet everything was just a few metro stops away. We went to the Round of 16 World Cup match, so the proximity to the stadium was great. I'd definitely recommend the apartment to everyone, it couldn't have gone smoother. Thanks, Françoise!",9.0

"We first communicated with Eric by email and we immediately felt that we were dealing with someone serious and very kind. All our emails received quick responses. 

He made sure our arrival went perfectly and it did! :D

Eric came to visit us after a few weeks to see if everything was going well. We had the impression that an old friend was visiting us.

The apartment itself was exactly as described and met our expectations. All the equipment we could wish for is available and brand new. 

Very well located in the heart of the entertainment district, we did everything on foot (right next to shops on Rue Sainte Catherine, 20 minutes from Mount Royal, 25 minutes from Plateau...) and the metro is right at the doorstep.

The only ""downside"" would be that nights were sometimes disturbed by noisy activities in the neighborhood. But it didn't spoil our stay at all.",10.0
"Amazing view of Place des Arts. 

This apartment was perfect for us. Not just a great location (just in front of Place des Arts Subway station, a block away from a grocery store) but it has a great view of Place des Arts. I really enjoyed watching the Festival Mode & Design from the apartment's window.

Very well equipped: dishwasher, hairdryer, plenty of tableware, you can easily cook anything you want. It has air conditioning, which was perfect for those hot summer days. Washer and dryer inside the apartment.

It was a very clean apartment. You feel like in a hotel room, with plenty of sets of white sheets and many clean towels, if you want to change them. 

I had to check in earlier, so I had the chance to meet the cleaning lady, who was really attentive. 

If I am back to Montreal I would rent it again, no doubt.",10.0
"This is hands down the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in! Eric was the perfect host, communication was excellent! The apartment was amazing, spotless, fast wifi and the perfect location in Montreal.

Eric recommended a great sushi place just a few doors down! The hot water, AC, and washer dryer were all welcome.

"The apartment is very conveniently located. Almost everything you would want to do in Montreal is within an easy walk. The apartment has a nice view of the fountains at the Metropolitan Art Centre. The shopping district of St Catherine street is a couple of blocks away. It's close to McGill and so lots of cafes and Bistros in the area to hop in and sip a latte. The apartment is well furnished. There is a washer dryer in the bathroom. 
The kitchen is well equipped but the cookware is limited to a large pot to boil pasta. So you may have to buy a cheap pan if you plan to cook at the apartment. Adequate crockery and cutlery is available. There are provision and departmental stores just around the corner. There is a cafe on the ground floor of the building. 
Eric made the check-in process super simple and organized. It was like we were walking into an apartment we had lived in for months. Truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider staying at the same place in the future.",10.0

"I would have given this property 5 stars, except for the noise factor due to the Jazz Fest. So like 11 out of the 12 months of the year 5 stars. I was in Montreal for school/work, so I needed to spend time studying, which proved to be difficult as the music from the festival lasted until 1:00 am each and every day.

Also, the AC broke, but since I was there during the longest heat wave Montreal has ever experienced, a broken AC was almost inevitable. The city's entire cooling system must have been and still is under extreme stress. The day I left Montreal, the temperature in the apartment was 83 degrees. 

I had to leave Montreal very early due to a serious medical emergency at home. My father is gravely ill, had a cardiac arrest and is still a patient in the ICU. So it's been stressful. Eric was VERY helpful during this difficult situation and helped me check out immediately. 

The apartment itself was great and clean. Loved the location.

"We had a great time staying at Eric's. It is in a great location and is the perfect size for two people. The rooftop patio is a giant plus and has a nice view of La Croix du Mont Royal. Eric responded promptly to any questions, and check-in and check-out were a breeze. We would love to stay here again.",10.0

"Staying here was an amazing experience! Marie-Andree gave us a great orientation when we first arrived and I was really happy that we had everything we needed from the start - fresh towels, bedding, kitchen supplies, mini toiletries in the bathroom - and the place was spotless! It was like staying at a nice hotel. Great location close to some nice bars and restaurants, and Marie-Andree was lovely and responsive until the very end. Very happy to have been the first guests here - hope many more get to enjoy the space :)",9.0
"We miss Montreal already. We had such a great time there. The flat is divine. Marie-Andree and Stephane were really welcoming (and great at helping us out before and during our stay with all our questions) and the location -- The Plateau -- is superb. Lots of cute restaurants and cafes on Rue Laurier, a minute away, and more shopping and bars on Rue Mont Royal, a 10-minute walk. We couldn't have hoped for more. Thanks to Marie-Andree and Stephane for being so kind and putting so much thought into your flat. We hope to see you again soon!",9.0
"We had a fantastic stay in this beautiful apartment on the Plateau. The location is unbeatable, only steps away from the charming, tree-lined rue Laurier, which is chock full of great cafés, restaurants, bakeries & grocery stores. The apartment was spotless and had everything we could need, including a great & calm back balcony spot for a nice BBQ and glass of wine (or two) at the end of the day. Thanks Marie-Andrée & Stéphane, we will definitely return again.",9.0
"Marie-Andrée was a super welcoming and available host! The ease of communication was greatly appreciated. The apartment, in turn, was impeccable, charming and met all our expectations. It is located in a lovely neighborhood near many shops and cafes. We only regret that we didn't have enough time to enjoy the surroundings and the BBQ which was at our disposal! My friends and I are grateful for your hospitality. See you soon! :)",9.0
"This apartment was truly charming and perfect for our recent 3 night stay in Montreal. My teen daughter, her two friends and I all loved it. It was spotlessly clean, decorated in a very welcoming, comfortable way, and had everything we needed for our stay. The kitchen is so pleasant with large windows and high ceilings, perfect to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning. The back patio was equally inviting and we enjoyed eating breakfast and dinner there. The pictures accurately show the apartment but can't quite do it full justice. The neighborhood also won us over - it is a beautiful residential street - lots of trees, easy parking (but pay attention to certain sections requiring a residential sticker), and very safe. Rue Laurier is a 2 minute walk and full of cafes, restaurants, a grocery store, and cute shops. The metro is about 10 minutes away by foot but a nice walk along Laurier and past the park. We took advantage of the Bixi bikes at the corner of the block (2 minutes away) and loved exploring the city by bike - made very easy with the bike lanes and attention to cyclists all throughout the city. Marie-Andree and Stephane could not have been nicer in welcoming us to Montreal and to the apartment. They were quick to respond to emails before our arrival and waiting to meet us when we arrived - even an hour late after a long delay at the US/Canadian border. We had to get right back out the door for an event and they were very helpful with metro directions. It is very nice having them living right downstairs - very convenient if there were any questions. The next day I texted asking if it was a good time to ask for advice on some sightseeing. They were out to lunch but sent Marie-Andree's brother over to answer my questions and provide great recommendations. There was fresh fruit, milk, butter and condiments in the refrigerator, and delicious coffee - very thoughtful and particularly helpful as we didn't have to go to the store right away and were able to enjoy our first morning with the food we brought and what they left for us. All in all, we loved staying here, highly recommend it and hope to come back to Montreal and stay here again. Our only complaint was that we couldn't stay another day or two! Thank you Marie-Andree and Stephane!",9.0

"Beautiful one-bedroom apartment with den in one of the best neighborhoods in Montreal (Petit Laurier in Plateau Mont-Royal). Hosts were quick to reply in communications and the listing was exactly as per the photos. Three beds (one bedroom and two sofa beds) were comfortable and the experience was hotel-like with extra blankets and pillows, toiletries and a beautiful patio at the back.",9.0

Whenever we get a chance to come back to Montreal, this will be our go-to place for accommodation! Merci beaucoup!",9.0
"Two adults and one child visited Montreal in summer for two days. We enjoyed the city and the nice apartment. It was near downtown (a 15-minute walk to the next subway station, and with the subway a 10-minute ride). Rue Manquette was very charming and close by we could use the restaurants, supermarket... everything we needed. We met only Stephane, he was a very good host and he was very friendly. Marie and Stephane answered every question via SMS...thank you very much. They helped us whenever. The apartment was cozy and adequate for the price. Maybe the balcony was a little bit too small for us. 

We recommend Marie and Stephane as good hosts. Thanks for everything.",9.0
"A wonderful couple who made us feel welcome. Great communication via email prior to our visit (we were coming from the US and would not have the ability to make phone calls or access email once we crossed the border). Beautiful space with deck access. Fully equipped kitchen, though there were so many great restaurants two blocks away that we never cooked!",9.0
"Marie and Stephane were such wonderful hosts. They were very accommodating, warm, communicative and responsive. We traveled with two teens who also thought the apartment was perfect - comfortable, very clean and ideally located. A short walk to several great restaurants, boutiques and about ten mins to the metro. Pleasant walk to hip shopping strips and cafes. We loved exploring Montreal and will definitely be back. Thanks to our hosts who played a part in making this visit quite memorable...",9.0
"The neighborhood is very charming and pleasant; it's on a lovely private street, and the apartment itself is very tidy and clean. I didn't meet the host, but they were quick to answer any questions via the messaging app on the Airbnb app.

Our only complaint was that the pull-out couch wasn't very easy to unfold into a bed. Also, the lock for the door is hard to close and secure before leaving. 

Other than that, the place is nice and good for four people (once you unfold the bed, of course).",9.0
"Bon stay in Montreal!

Corresponds exactly to the website description with a small bathroom (especially the sink), but very functional. Beautiful sunny balcony in the afternoon. An address to remember; we'll definitely be back soon!",9.0

"We stayed here just before the holidays and had a great experience. Everything was as described and although we didn't get much of a chance to chat with Stephane, he was very friendly and inviting. The location is great. Lots of restaurants and bakeries nearby as well as a grocery store. The place was very clean and although the bathroom is small, it was totally functional and the shower had great pressure! Overall, we would stay here again and definitely recommend it to others.",9.0

"Our stay at Marie-Andrée and Stéphane's apartment was perfect. The place was clean and simple, yet with just enough to make it convenient and give it character. The street is quiet and the neighborhood charming. It's a great location if you want to be close to the Plateau, Mile-End, and Parc Lafontaine but slightly off the main streets. There are several great restaurants and shops within an easy walk and conveniently located near the metro. I would definitely stay again.",9.0

"Marie-Andrée and Stéphane emailed us to let us know our apartment was no longer available for the booked dates, but they offered us another for the same price to compensate for the inconvenience. Although we did not stay in the apartment pictured, I will still review our experience. Our arrival time ended up being a bit later than originally planned, however it didn't end up being an issue and Stéphane was very flexible with meeting times. We met Stéphane at the apartment upon arrival and he gave us a tour and the keys. The apartment was absolutely gorgeous and it was in a great location. Free parking on the street. The only negative was that it was very warm inside, and because of the large windows, sunny days and lack of air conditioning made it harder to cool down the apartment; however they did have multiple fans throughout the apartment. They were readily available to answer any questions and were easy to contact. I would definitely recommend staying in one of Marie-Andrée and Stéphane's apartments! I would stay there again.",9.0

"Beautiful spot with lots of character in a nice area. Quaint and comfortable. All amenities available: shampoo, conditioner, toiletries, towels, etc. A definite 10/10!",9.0
"Communication before arrival was great. We let Marie-Andree and Stephane know that we would be arriving later than originally planned; they would be out, so left a key inside. Easy.  We found the neighborhood beautiful, and the location good. Parking was easy. Stephane recommended a great sushi restaurant (Tri Express) on the corner. The apartment itself was, for the most part, comfortable. The bedroom, the bed. Plenty of closet space, hangers, surface space to put stuff. Cute kitchen. Cute shared deck with grill (we didn't use it, however). Fans were a welcome thing as it was warm and humid during much of our stay.  What wasn't expected was the uncomfortable sofa bed: you could feel the bars of the frame whether sitting or sleeping, and the noise late at night from the very heavy-footed upstairs neighbors. If you are a light sleeper you may also find this disruptive. Also, the apartment was very clean, except for the floors which seemed not to have been washed in a while which we noticed from walking barefoot. I don't like ending on a negative note, so I'll close by saying the hosts were friendly and responsive.",9.0
"This is a fantastic apartment in a great location. It's a quick 15-minute walk to the metro, and there are lots of great restaurants and stores nearby. The apartment is in an older building with lots of historical details, including gorgeous hardwood floors. The bathroom, while small, is well appointed, and the kitchen is excellent. We really enjoyed the outdoor deck area for breakfast.  The host family lives right downstairs and was a joy to deal with. Truly one of our best rental experiences. Highly recommended!",9.0

"Marie and Stéphane's accommodation is very comfortable, clean, and well-equipped. It is ideally located in a very quiet neighborhood, yet close to shops and the animation of Mont Royal street. It is very easy to get around on foot to discover Montreal as buses and the metro are nearby (the Laurier station is 10 minutes walk away). Stéphane welcomed me upon my arrival and showed me the accommodation and its amenities. Marie and Stéphane live on the ground floor, so they are easily reachable if needed. I had a wonderful stay and recommend this accommodation.",9.0

"Excellent bed, very quiet and exceptionally located.",9.0
"Upon our arrival, Stéphane was absent but had agreed upon a location for us to pick up the key. He joined us later and made sure we were missing nothing. He was very welcoming and communication was easy at every stage of the reservation. 

The location is very idyllic with beautiful streets lined with trees and charming alleys. There are several shops and a grocery store nearby, and it's pleasant to stroll around the neighborhood as a family.  It's also close to the Laurier Park where there are facilities for young children. 

There is a bit of a lack of space in the kitchen to eat for four people, but the place is very warm and welcoming. We have two children under 4 years old and everything was well-adapted: we didn't need to make the place ""kid-proof."" There are also young children living nearby, which kept them company. The other tenants of the building are very calm and quiet, no issues on that side. We were able to park right on the street and made our trips by metro. 

In short, it was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend Marie-Andrée and Stéphane's accommodation!",9.0

"Great place with an even greater host! Carlos was very thorough in making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The apartment is in a wonderful location. It's the 2nd house up from the water on a quiet street. Bike paths following the water are a wonderful place to run, bike and walk. The apartment has a newly renovated kitchen & bathroom. The kitchen has great quality pots & pans, a drip coffee maker and a Krups pump espresso machine for us caffeine addicts. The wall AC unit was great and will be very useful in the summer months. The non-renovated floors are a bit creaky, giving you an authentic Montreal feel.  All in all a wonderful place with a wonderful host.",10.0

"Our accommodation on Clemenceau was exactly as described and as pictured in the photographs. The apartment was very, very clean, and incredibly quiet. The pictures do not do the kitchen and bathroom justice; they were both beautifully renovated. The kitchen was well equipped; we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  The location was excellent for anyone who enjoys cycling or walking; only steps from the riverfront trail and bird sanctuary. There is a public swimming pool within walking distance that is very cool.   Although the apartment is not located in the heart of Montreal, there is a bus stop a few minutes away with a short ride to the Metro (subway) to take you downtown. Getting to the heart of Montreal is easy by car. There was ample street parking.  Our host, Carlos, was downstairs and was very accommodating. We would recommend this accommodation.",10.0
"The house is exactly as advertised, in my opinion this is a unique house. The house combines historic charm with wood floors and antique cupboards, etc., and upgraded kitchen and bathroom, which are absolutely wonderful.

Ample parking is available on the street. 

I had a great stay and would recommend it to friends and family.",10.0

"Carlos is the nicest host you can find! He responds immediately and is very helpful. 
The apartment is spacious, with two bedrooms and like two dining rooms (or one but just huge).
The kitchen is fully equipped and even more... the heated floors are awesome!
The apartment is located in a peaceful, calm area. Very close to water and parks. A 2-minute walk to the bus stop. However, consider having a car if you want to go downtown every day. 
We enjoyed our stay there. Thank you, Carlos!",10.0

Carlos is awesome and very sweet. Highly recommend.,10.0
"A clean cozy apartment and Carlos is an ideal host - responsive, cordial and helpful.

For a special Montreal experience by bike, this is the ideal place to stay.",10.0

It is very close to the riverside where you can walk or cycle. The included bikes are great and we used them to cycle into the old town one day - it took around 45 minutes but it was a very leisurely cycle. There is also public transport nearby, and I would definitely recommend leaving the car at the house. 
All in all, I would not hesitate in recommending this property to anyone.",10.0

Always a pleasure to stay at Philippe's.,10.0
"We really enjoyed our stay at Philippe's apartment - La maison aux raisins. It was our first Airbnb experience so we were not sure what to expect. Philippe was great to deal with. He always responded quickly and even though French is his first language, we had no problems communicating in English.

This apartment is about a 10-minute walk from two metro stations (Pie IX and Joliette) and if you have luggage, you can take a bus to/from the metro station (the metro is down the hill from this house), the bus stop is right around the corner from the house. When we arrived, Philippe greeted us with the keys and gave us a tour of the apartment. He thoughtfully had a small snack on the table for us and showed us lots of things he set aside to help us out on our trip such as maps of the city and a booklet with information to help us find grocery stores, malls, etc.

The apartment was cozy with lots of things to make us feel welcome. The kitchen was well-equipped, although we mostly ate out enjoying the great food in Montreal. There is plenty of room in the fridge and appliances to make meals or reheat leftovers. The bathroom was very clean and modern. There is a nice-sized storage area to keep empty suitcases and bags. Everywhere we looked in the apartment, we found things set out to make our stay a good one - there was a candy jar, coffee, tea, jams, bread in the freezer, a first aid kit, sewing kit, and a laundry room. There was even local art on the walls and lots of decorations around the place to make us feel at home.

I have nothing to compare this experience to other than hotel stays but both my wife and I were very impressed with both Philippe and Marie and the apartment. If we are ever back in Montreal, I will be sure to check the availability of La maison aux raisins.",10.0
"Excellent stay, as always!",10.0
"Super apartment! Located in a semi-basement, it is bright but still fresh, very clean and well-equipped.

"Philip was a wonderful host. He provided many thoughtful touches like a binder with all the info you need about the place as well as visiting Montreal. Like many of the other reviews, he provided a nice snack as a welcome. The venue is clean and stylish with all the amenities you could ever need to live comfortably. It's close to main transportation, and will get you to downtown within half an hour. I would definitely stay here again for future trips to Montreal",10.0
"Very nice apartment, pleasant and clean.  It's not very bright because it's on the basement level but that didn't cause us any problems!",10.0
"My husband and I spent a long weekend in Montreal for my birthday. We found Philippe's place to be a wonderful value for the money and it was a very comfortable apartment. It's a basement level unit with Philippe living right upstairs so the host is always conveniently nearby. We found that he responded to messages quickly.  We met him during check-in when he showed us the apartment and pointed out where we can find items we may need. He gave us the keys, showed us how to lock the doors and walked us through how to park. He was very pleasant. There were many thoughtful items left for us: a couple muffins for breakfast, water, juice and beer in the fridge, plenty of tea in the cupboard. The kitchen was well stocked with pots and pans, a variety of dishes, etc. The mattress was firm and while I like a softer mattress (my husband prefers one that is firm!) I found that I woke up well rested and comfortable.

We found the location of the apartment to be absolutely wonderful.  It was a short walk (about 5 mins) to the Biodome, Botanical Gardens and Pie IX metro station. The apartment is located on a wonderfully quiet residential street and we felt very safe leaving our car parked on the street. Near the apartment is a grocery store as well as 3 local parks that were beautiful to walk through. We couldn't have been happier with the location of this space.",10.0
A wonderful place with everything needed to stay for a couple of days or longer. I'll be back soon,10.0
Well-located with all the necessary equipment and more. Thank you.,10.0
"This was our first Airbnb and it was wonderful! The apartment was beautiful, apparently new, and well-equipped on a quiet street. Philippe went far beyond what we could have expected in helping us. When we were having trouble finding our way from the airport, he came and picked us up at the Metro. He was available every time we needed any help planning what we would do in Montreal. 

The most fascinating place we visited turned out to be the botanical garden, unlike anything we’ve seen anywhere else, and the big chain of greenhouses with plants from around the world and information about them. They are a short walk from Philippe's house, as is the Metro. There's a bus to a different Metro station that stops even closer to his house but we didn't use it.

Overall, Montreal was a great vacation for us. The only downside was flight delays in both directions, to and from Boston. We could have gotten there much faster and easier by car, which is how we will go if we have a chance for a second trip.",10.0
"This was our third trip to Montreal since our son and daughter-in-law got married, and Philippe's home will be our go-to from now on. Everything about the place made us feel like we had found a rare gem. From the high-end finishes in the kitchen and bathroom, to the linens and towels, and the yummy muffins and other thoughtful touches.  Philippe had a quick response to any question or need we had and truly made us feel welcome in his home.",10.0

"Lovely large airy apartment in a very good part of Montreal. Good transport connections. Everything nearby on Monkland, including a good coffee shop. Barbecue and back deck directly off kitchen so very pleasant. Initially not as clean as we are used to with Airbnb, but Kristin sorted this as soon as we raised it sending the cleaning company, and was in touch throughout to check that things were Ok. There is a problem with the second bedroom window, which lacks an insect screen, a necessity particularly in summer. The 2 double bedrooms are fine, but the sofa/bed is not comfortable. Subject to these points being fixed, we recommend this.",8.0
Emilie & her roommate Olivia were amazing hosts who made me feel comfortable from the very first minute I arrived. The apartment is located in a very nice area with lots of cafes and shops.

"Absolutely satisfied with my stay!! Look no further. This is the place to stay in Montreal!!! Emilie and Olivia are the friendliest, most welcoming hostesses you will find! I stayed with them for 11 days and it was the best decision I could have made. They are so kind, resourceful and well informed about every place in the city. Their pride and love for Montreal is expressed elegantly in every corner of their home. They truly make every accommodation possible and enjoyable  with impeccable taste and exceptional attention to detail. The room and bed are extremely comfortable and the closet space generous. Their spacious apartment is conveniently located near any available mode of transportation in the city within a city block's distance. It's prime location in ""le plateau"" places you at the heart of one of the most exciting neighborhoods in the entire city with  restaurants, cafes and entertainment all around where you can enjoy delicious food, beer and great live music. The back terrace is a true refuge for when you want to kick back, enjoy the good weather and relax after a long day going about town.

Ideally located in the residential Montroyal neighborhood and on a very quiet street, yet also bordering downtown and Latin Quarter, this apartment has all the advantages one could hope for: spacious, arranged with much taste and personality, equipped with all possible amenities for the kitchen and comfort, with very peaceful bedrooms, a sunny little courtyard where you can enjoy breakfast and meals feeling truly like you're on vacation.

"The apartment was located in a nice central spot on a quiet street. Everything you might need for a short stay was available. We appreciated that the place was clean, tastefully furnished, and well maintained.

Parking is available on the street. Montreal experienced moderate snowfall, which made parking a little adventurous due to changes in parking rules to accommodate street clearing. It wasn't really a problem for us, but for those unfamiliar with the cryptic parking regulations of most cities, this could be a little daunting.",10.0
"This place is a gem! Fantastic location: near restaurants, transportation links, bars, shops, and the lovely Parc La Fontaine. It is spotless, well-equipped, and quiet.

It was really perfect for me, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",10.0

The apartment was furnished with everything we needed and was incredibly charming. The Plateau neighborhood was very friendly and has countless restaurants and bars to offer. Parking was also free and very convenient on the street directly in front of the apartment. Richard was also kind enough to help us remove our car from the snow when it got stuck as we were leaving from our stay. Overall, I could not have asked for more hospitality, or a better place to stay in Montreal!",10.0

Service and amenities were fantastic. The place itself is incredible and of course the location is great!,10.0
"We spent a week in Richard and Martine's place in Montréal and found it everything we could have hoped for. Situated close to transportation or for walking to and about Le Plateau and surrounding areas, it is the type of lodging Montréal is famous for. If you know the city then you already know Le Carré Saint-Louis and its ideal location. And if you are new to Montreál, you will not find a greater introduction to really living like a local while still having all the tourist areas so close at hand. I have been to this city countless times for my work and for personal pursuits and would choose this apartment far above any other place I have stayed. Thanks Richard and Martine for providing such a lovely home away from home.",10.0
"Perfect apartment, perfect location, perfect hosts! We stayed in Richard's stylish and cozy apartment for a week in early July, and have nothing but praise. The location in Plateau Mont-Royal is great. In a quiet street with two-story buildings, close to a nice park in a vibrant and wonderful neighborhood. Downtown is only a 30 minute walk away. With Plateau and Parc Mont-Royal within walking distance in the other direction. And a metro stop close by if you need to go further - or if you don't want to walk. Richard was very helpful with advice and tips, and made us feel very welcome. We travelled as a family of four, with two boys in their teens. The apartment worked out very well for us. On an evening with unexpected rain, we had no problem retreating to the apartment to relax there. Plateau was without doubt the right district to stay on our first visit to Montréal. Relaxed, informal and easygoing. Full of charm and character. Picturesque buildings, good restaurants, and an area where we felt totally safe.

"A huge thank you to Martine and Richard for this wonderful rental in the heart of Montreal. We just spent 15 days in this apartment which was our ""base camp"" to discover a part of this marvelous province that is Quebec.

The apartment is ideally located, on a peaceful street in Plateau overlooking the adorable Carré Saint-Louis square and close to the lively streets of downtown and Old Montreal: all the must-see attractions of Montreal are within walking distance or via Bixi! 

The apartment offers all the amenities of a very comfortable home and the bedding is excellent. We truly feel at ease here!

It's without a doubt the address we will choose again when we return to Montreal and we highly recommend it without reservation!",10.0

Martine & Richard were fantastic hosts who helped us navigate the neighborhood. We loved the city of Anne and we'll be back soon!,10.0

Richard filled us in on the history of the area and the house when he greeted us right after our arrival. The kitchen had everything we needed (except a teapot!). The bathroom is a good size. There was lots of space everywhere in the house so we weren't tripping over each other. It was great to have a private outdoor space. Everything is on the ground floor, so there were no flights of stairs to climb. We very much enjoyed our experience in our first stay at an Airbnb. We would highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a great place to stay in a historic area of Montreal.",10.0
Richard and his wife's place was great! Three of us were attending a scientific conference downtown and wanted to have a true Montreal experience so we wanted to stay in the Plateau region. Their place is located in a beautiful neighborhood and on a quiet street. Popular Saint Denis St is just around the corner and a convenient Metro stop (Sherbrooke) is nearby.

Excellent communication with Richard. Very welcoming. Richard is very available and very responsive to any problems (small wifi issue quickly resolved).

"Recommend this address for multiple titles. 

First, because the apartment is ideally located, just a hundred meters from the Sherbrooke metro station, two steps away from typical Montreal streets like Saint Denis, Saint Laurent or the pedestrian area of Prince Arthur, all right next to the beautiful XIXth century mansions in the square Saint Louis. 

Second, because the apartment is impeccable: it offers all comfort, cleanliness and superb decoration. Noteworthy: the absence of TV, lamented by children, applauded by parents.

Finally, the owners are just like the reputation of the hospitality of Quebecers: warm, kind and welcoming.  You will benefit from a thousand and one tips and anecdotes about Montreal and Quebec when you contact them.",10.0

**""There are some positive things to say about this stay: one feels at home in this pleasant house located in the heart of a lively and very central neighborhood, but on a quiet and peaceful street. The apartment is on the ground floor, which we found quite practical (and by contrast, makes it rather dark, its only drawback). Space, comfort, and everything you need to cook really well. All shops are nearby, as well as the metro. The owners have been very accommodating and advised us several times (on activities and places). Ideal location for two couples.""**",10.0
"This is a great apartment located on a quiet side street with a nice park steps away, a vibrant shopping area in the other direction and only a couple minutes walk from bus stops and a Metro station which will get you just about anywhere you want to go.

The apartment is fantastic, the decor is very individual and beautiful, it fits perfectly with the house. It is very well equipped with everything you want. 
Richard has made the extra effort and picked out individual tips for sightseeing for us. He is very helpful and friendly. The communication was absolutely perfect. Thank you so much!
The entire neighborhood is the most beautiful area of Montreal, so sightseeing starts directly at the front door of the apartment. I liked the area and the apartment and everything very much and would definitely book the apartment again whenever I come back to Montreal.

Unfortunately, the wifi and television weren't working the whole three days we were there, but Jonathan tried really hard to get it sorted out.

"Great apartment that looks exactly like the photos!

The location couldn't be better, an easy walk to the old town and port area, and about a 10-15 minute walk uphill to the Berri metro station for access to the Olympic stadium. There is space for life attractions and the botanical garden.

Communication with Joe was always quick, and he was also quick and helpful in replying when we sent a query while we were there.

Parking at the secure parking lot directly under the building, and you get a key fob so you can come and go as you please.

Joe asks you to contact him an hour before your arrival so he can meet you outside, which we struggled with a little; we allowed half an hour extra but got stuck in a traffic jam from 6km outside the city! ...we made it only 2 minutes late!

We were a bit disappointed after reading other reviews that there was no champagne or bread on our arrival. Maybe he's stopped providing them (although there were over 20 empty bottles under the sink!).",10.0

Jonathan's place was FANTASTIC, clean, comfortable, and it is conveniently located close to Old Montreal, which is where I wanted to stay.

We had an unannounced visit from a construction worker on Sunday morning who came into the apartment, and we were not able to get in touch with the host to see whether we should let him in, which was not ideal.

My girlfriend and I would definitely recommend staying at Karl's place when you visit Montreal.",9.0

It was blisteringly cold in Montreal, but Karl's apartment was warm and cozy with an excellent vinyl collection and an N64 (MarioKart included!).

The only downsides were that free parking can be hard to find and the wifi was a little weak. I lucked out and, after circling the block a few times, was able to find parking just in front of the apartment, and I didn't really need the internet much anyway.",9.0

"Fantastic experience! 

Karl was so nice, accommodating, and very quick to answer any questions we had. We got in a little later than expected, and he helped us find a parking spot where we could stay for the entire weekend. Being so close to the metro made getting around really easy; we parked the car and didn't look back. There were bikes, locks, and helmets to use, which were a plus, but we didn't end up using them.

The place is great. We loved the record player, and the kitchen was perfect, small and stocked. The greenery around the apartment was a nice touch too. 

This was our first time using Airbnb and Karl certainly raised the bar high.

Merci beaucoup!",9.0

"Although I did not actually meet Karl in person, he was very accommodating and gave me plenty of information about the apartment. His friend Sarah was there to oversee things and was lovely and helpful. The apartment itself was in the perfect location for me, and although it's right downtown the tiny street was fairly quiet. The building is very old and has a lot of character but could also use a bit of TLC, such as a paint touch-up. A few things also seemed a bit jerry-rigged together. All in all, it met my needs just fine.",9.0
"My husband and I had a terrific honeymoon in Montreal, no small thanks to Karl! His place was cozy, spacious and within walking distance to several bars, shops and restaurants that we frequented. Karl even provided a list of recommendations, which came in handy since we are from the US. Karl was accommodating, and easy to work with. When we make it back to Montreal, we would love to stay here again. Thank you!!!",9.0
"The apartment reservation was made the day before, and I received a positive response very quickly from Karl, which is appreciated. What makes it even more enjoyable is his charming apartment. Sunny, bright, and quiet. I spent a lovely evening and day the following day there. It was a delightful stopover on the way to Paris. I was able to stay in the house the whole next day before my evening flight. I highly recommend Karl's apartment!",9.0
"Karl is a great host; he is very responsive and left helpful maps to indicate parking areas. The apartment is right off Saint Catherine and is just minutes away from the metro. A reliable host, convenient location, and fantastic price!",9.0
"Karl was an excellent host and accommodated our late arrival on the first night with great grace. The apartment itself was exactly what we needed: very close to my work and the metro, as well as cool neighborhoods to eat and go out. The place has a lot of charm, with unique, original architectural details and a very cute vintage kitchen. Overall, the apartment had a very European feel and felt quite cozy (and quiet) despite the busy downtown location. Karl provided us with plenty of clean towels and coffee. Both Robin and I enjoyed our stay. Thanks, Karl! -Danica",9.0
"We had a great stay at Karl's apartment. The place has so much character and is in a nice part of town. The metro is easily accessible, and there are lots of nice places to check out nearby. Karl is a great host with good communication before and during the trip. Highly recommend staying here when visiting Montreal!",9.0
"The apartment was exactly as Karl described it; spacious, very bright and well located. We would love to stay here again as it is such a cozy home. 

The metro is very close by so you have access to most of the city while being tucked away in a quiet spot. Saint Catherine Ouest is minutes away and is a great place to wander along.

Karl was great at keeping in touch and very flexible even though he seemed quite busy. He'd thought of everything from coffee to towels to make our stay a very comfortable one.",9.0
"Karl was a great host and his home was a great base for all of our adventures in Montreal. Centrally located to St. Catherine Street and Old Montreal, it was perfect for seeing most of the city on foot while also being close to the metro station. We were happy to find many great restaurants and even a comedy club nearby. :)

Karl provided a map to various eateries which was a big help when we first ventured out to find food. The parking guide that we were given was the biggest help in avoiding tickets in a city that is partially permit, free, and metered parking. Karl was very communicative during our stay and even checked in with us halfway through the weekend. 

I would recommend anyone to stay in his home. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious for two people with lots of Victorian charm.",9.0
"The apartment was wonderful, very clean and comfortable! Perfect location; a quiet side street within a few blocks of the more main areas. Karl was really helpful with finding parking nearby and coordinating getting the key. We didn't know our arrival time until the morning of but he was easy to get a hold of and figure out last minute details. 

Great place and host, highly recommend it!",9.0
"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely lovely stay here. Karl did a great job at making us feel at home. He had great recommendations of things to do in the area. He was also very prompt with communication. The apartment was great, we had everything we needed and it felt very cozy.  The neighborhood was great too, just steps away from restaurants, shopping, and the metro. We had a great stay in Montreal and we would totally recommend this place to a friend!",9.0
"Had a great time. The apartment was cozy for a quick winter getaway. Scoring parking right outside was a plus. Karl was super awesome and flexible. Excellent location. I really enjoyed the space, I'd stay again.",9.0
"We had a great and stress-free stay at Karl's place. He wasn't able to be there when we checked in, but he sent me a very detailed message about getting the keys, where to go, and how to get in. Once inside, there were detailed printouts about the apartment, parking, and restaurants/bars in the area. The parking instructions greatly helped, as we don't know French and had no idea where we could and couldn't park. His place was simple and clean and provided just what we needed for a one-night stay in Montreal. The heat was at a very comfortable level when we arrived and remained so throughout the night. The place is old, so be aware. That isn't necessarily a negative aspect, but don't expect hotel quality or the particulars of new or newly renovated buildings. AGAIN, there was nothing wrong with the place and we appreciated the charm of an old building. I would recommend staying here to anyone. We were able to walk to most of the areas dense with bars and restaurants within 15 minutes. In fact, with a few minutes you can get to St. Catherine which literally has everything located on it.",9.0
"Karl's place is in a fantastic location, well-equipped and comfortable. My husband spent over two months in the apartment and it became our home away from home in Montreal. We got used to the few quirks of the place which can be attributed to the age of the building. Overall, a nice place and a great host, thank you so much!",9.0
"We stayed at Karl's place for just over a week and enjoyed every minute of it. The apartment is really bright and very cozy. It has a few quirks like creaky floors, but that just adds to the charm. The apartment was very clean and its well situated. Karl was a great host. He provided us with extra keys and checked up on us to make sure everything was ok. He was also really easy to contact and quick to reply.",9.0
"Karl was an excellent host! We didn't get the chance to meet him but he provided lots of information about his place and Montreal before we even arrived. Key pick-up/drop-off was easy, the apartment was very clean (and charming!) and his parking diagrams were very much appreciated (especially since we were there on Victoria Day long weekend). You couldn't ask for a better location either - the metro was a few minutes walk away and there were plenty of places to eat/shop nearby. If you're looking for a charming apartment right in the middle of all the action, his place is perfect.",9.0
"Beautiful apartment in a fabulous location! Everything was as pictured, though some parts of the apartment seemed a little aged, such as the bed frame which was held up on blocks. Nonetheless, we had a wonderful four-day stay. We used the kitchen only to keep ingredients for light breakfast (no stovetop use), but the fridge definitely came in handy. The living room receives a lot of light and eating breakfast at the table by the window (which actually has a quaint view overlooking a small playground) was a very nice amenity. Overall, an adequately clean, safe, and comfortable apartment. The privacy was highly valued, as was the three-block proximity to the metro. A great value that I would highly recommend to other travelers!",9.0
"We've had a wonderful time at Karl's place. The host was kind enough to leave detailed instructions of nearby places to visit, so getting around is quite easy and, most importantly, there is a subway station within walking distance so you can get quickly wherever you want. The place is as described: spacious and with a very useful fully equipped kitchen (not only the basic hardware for show, but all kinds of spices and things a person really uses for cooking). There is an espresso machine and a turntable. Both were very useful, as I could enjoy some java while listening to calypso records I had just bought (many nice places for used vinyl in Montreal!). There are some quirks one might need to get used to: since it is an old house, the wooden floors are noisy, there is a steep stairway to get to the condo, and the doors or windows might get difficult to open or close; actually one of the external windows fell onto my friend's finger as he was trying to deal with a jammed latch. It bled badly and hurt a lot, but thankfully there was a well-equipped first aid kit to deal with the situation. I do not blame the host, since it was an accident, but it is certainly related to specific oddities that make this overall a charming place to stay.",9.0
"Safe area, easy access from the 720, easy access to grocery stores and the metro, and walking distance to great restaurants and pubs. All in all, I wouldn't say this matched the description exactly...when we arrived, there was no AC and no wi-fi. However, when we called Karl to ask about the missing AC and wi-fi, he was accommodating -- he came to install a window-mounted AC unit on Day 2, and he did try to get us wi-fi, but unsuccessfully. The bedroom window gives onto a sort of alleyway where surrounding apartments have their balconies. On our first night, the neighbors had a party on their balcony that kept us up until about 2 am. It was impossible to block out the noise. The floors are very creaky, which makes it difficult to be quiet (i.e. if you're getting up at night, expect to wake up everyone else in the place).",9.0
Karl was a wonderful host. His place truly felt like home. He was very communicative and accommodating with check-in and check-out times.,9.0
"Overall, this was an okay experience, and the host was away but very attentive. But - the apartment didn't meet our expectations based on the pictures & price point (we would say it was ""fairly pricey"" - not super cheap, but not super expensive compared to other listings we looked at). Would definitely stay again at a cheaper price, or if it was more polished. More details: There were multiple nights when the neighbors were loud until very late - 2am, 3am. Though the kitchen had plates, some spices, some dishes (enough to cook okay), it was not easy to cook in because there was no light & no small spoons and some other small items were missing. The bathroom was clean, but pretty rickety. There was only men's soap & no shampoo (though we were told there would be toiletries). The AC was only available in the bedroom, so it got pretty hot in the kitchen sometimes. The good: great location, clean, very attentive host, pretty spacious, and had great amenities (washer, dryer, etc). Overall I think this listing would be worth the ""fairly pricey"" price if things were more polished around the house - it has a great location, a great vibe, a great host, and is pretty spacious.",9.0
"We didn't get a chance to meet Karl but check-in was painless. 
The apartment is in a super great location, easily walkable and has a real neat walk... some good restaurants along the way.
The apartment itself is old, the furniture is tired, some of it is charming :) We had no issues, once the air conditioner in the room started doing its magic it saved our lives.",9.0
"Karl was a very accommodating host -- before our arrival, he provided detailed information about the location and parking instructions. He was friendly and responsive to our questions.

The location of the apartment is convenient, just 5 minutes walk away from the closest metro station and shops and restaurants.

We didn't spend too much time in the apartment itself but it is functional with all the essentials you would need!",9.0
"We had a fantastic time in Montreal while staying at the apartment. The entire experience was seamless from the time we booked the space to the time we checked out. Karl made us feel very welcome and at ease as he made himself available if we ever had any questions or concerns.

The apartment was just as described with a little added personality, which made us feel like we were staying over at a friend's place. The location of the apartment was perfect for us since it was so close to the metro. The two bikes that Karl made available for us to use were icing on the cake as we got to explore the city from a different perspective. Overall, we were both very happy with our experience and would definitely recommend this listing to any of our family or friends. Thanks, Karl!",9.0
"The place was easy to find and was very spacious, even for two people. All the amenities were provided. The place was in good condition. There were many apartment buildings nearby, so sometimes you could hear noise from the neighbors.",9.0
"We had a wonderful stay at Karl's place. Although we never actually met in person, he was always very quick to answer our questions. We were there in September, and the window boxes were full of geraniums. This made it an absolutely lovely place to have our morning coffees. That living room gets so much sunlight! We were also particularly drawn to this place because of the available bikes, but everything we wanted to see and do was so close that we ended up walking everywhere instead. The only downside was that the bed is ever so slightly uneven so that both people end up sinking into the middle. This would be fine for a couple but maybe annoying for friends sharing a bed. Upshot: the big couch is divinely comfortable. All in all, it's bright, unique, and well located. We would definitely recommend it.",9.0
"Our stay at Karl's place was thoroughly enjoyable. There were 3 of us (adults) staying there, but the place could easily hold 4 people. The apartment was exactly as listed and was very tidy and clean. The location is very convenient as it's just steps away from the metro where you can catch the bus or train to take you anywhere. Karl was always available by text/phone whenever we had questions for him. We would definitely rent this place again next time we visit Montreal!",9.0
"This apartment was exactly as it looked in the photos. We loved it as soon as we walked in. The big windows let in lots of sun and the whole thing was very spacious. We felt immediately welcome, because of Karl and because there were even a few things left in the fridge that we were free to take. Highly recommended and we'll be back!",9.0
"Overall, our experience staying at Karl's place was great! He was very friendly and communicative during our stay. From checking in to navigating around the area, Karl was helpful through everything. The place itself was charming, spacious, private and thankfully in close proximity to some cool restaurants, markets and a metro station. Karl helped make our vacation run smoothly and he was an incredibly generous host. Thanks, Karl!",9.0

"Karl was extremely responsive throughout the booking and the stay. His apartment is great - the lighting is incredible and the old feel is very cozy. It's exactly as shown in the photos and maybe even a little larger. We were able to use his kitchen and supplies to cook, which was really nice. Karl made us feel super welcome and the apartment was the perfect getaway for the weekend - definitely recommend!",9.0

Great apartment in a convenient location. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Karl!",9.0
Karl was very responsive and made it easy for us to access the apartment. The unit was just as pictured and very clean. It included everything people coming to Montréal for the weekend might need. The location is excellent and we were able to park right in front of the house. A great experience.,9.0
"Karl's place is wonderful. Located quite centrally, next to Atwater Metro you can reach all the interesting sites even within walking distance. The apartment is cozy and very quiet. Karl is very welcoming and ready to answer any question. The handover was quick and relaxed. Thanks Karl!!!! :)",9.0
"Karl was there to welcome us even though we only booked it day of and arrived early. His apartment was just as whimsical and cozy as the pictures suggested and the neighborhood was a perfect base from which to explore. He lent us a couple bikes as a bonus, which made exploring the canal, Atwater market, and old port a breeze. The kitchen was great for our breakfast overlooking the playground outside where the neighborhood kids play - a great little residential pocket in the heart of downtown. The gas stove, cappuccino machine, and tea assortment were a great touch. I highly recommend Karl as a host to anyone looking for a peaceful space in a great location; his home is a pleasure.",9.0
"We stayed at Karls apartment for a 3-day weekend. He was out of town at the time, but was very trusting and inviting towards us in his home. The apartment is perfectly located, a short walk to St-Catherine's Street where you can find all kinds of restaurants and bars, grocery stores, and close to the metro (subway). We really enjoyed our stay. Karls apartment was very comfortable, clean, and had everything we could have needed. There was always street parking during our stay, and there is even a cute little park right across the street from the apartment. Karl was kind enough to send us a message over the weekend to make sure that everything was going well. We would definitely recommend staying at his home for your stay in Montreal.",9.0
"The place was great, a nice little neighborhood, close to everything, spacious, the host was very quick to respond to questions and everything went very smoothly",9.0
"Karl was an excellent host. He answered all my questions promptly via text message and phone calls. His place is in a great location, within walking distance of At Catherine's. One main factor was the free parking near Karl's apartment. I would highly recommend staying at his place.",9.0
"We had a great time in Montreal, and having a host like Karl made it all easier and more home-like. Beautiful apartment and super comfortable. Great location also, which made it easier to get into town and Mount Royal. Definitely recommend this apartment and host.",9.0
"Great apartment, thank you so much, Karl!",9.0
The apartment is very old and has a lot of character.  It's a very bright location with lots of shops and restaurants nearby. It's also extremely close to the metro! Karl checked up on us and we really enjoyed our stay in this cozy apartment.,9.0
"Our trip to Montreal and our stay at Karl's was fantastic!

He was very communicative and helped us even before we arrived. He provided guidance about parking, tips about the city, and was very helpful in all regards. We are actually sad we didn't get to meet him in person.

The apartment itself is very cute, clean, and great location. Super close to metro stations, etc...floors are a little bit squeaky, but hey, that's part of the charm of staying at an old Victorian building.",9.0
"This was my first time booking an Airbnb, and Karl was a great host! He provided detailed instructions for check-in and parking, making the process smooth. The apartment was cute, clean, and great for our needs. Location is walking distance to restaurants and close to the metro for easy access to all of the landmarks and sights of Montreal!",9.0
"Our stay at Karl’s was fantastic. We felt welcomed in his home, and not just because the cute park across the street had a Fa Lun Da Fa marching band performance that put a little spring in our step. The front door key was a bit sticky to open at first, but after the first couple times we'd mastered it and it became a point of pride for us. His home was nice and cozy, with nice architectural details like stained glass windows and a lovely fireplace. We specifically loved using the espresso machine every morning as a special vacation treat. Karl was also nice enough to loan us his bikes, which made getting around cheap and way more fun than being stuck underground on a nice day. We feel like we saw so much because we were able to get around this way! If two wheels aren't for you, the city is very walkable and his home is just a short walk from the train station. Overall, Karl was friendly and communicative, even recommending bike routes for us to take. We would be happy to stay at his home again!",9.0
"We had a great stay at Karl's apartment. The location was great: a couple of blocks from the metro, within walking distance of a good number of shops and restaurants (including the best ramen I've ever had), and free parking that wasn't too difficult to come by in a quiet neighborhood. 

Karl was generous with his amenities, welcoming us to use anything we found in the kitchen and making check-in and check-out super easy. The apartment wasn't anything fancy, but it was cozy and just what we needed. 

As a host, Karl is clearly concerned with his guests' experience. He gave me a bunch of recommendations for things to do in the area and checked in several times via text/email even though he wasn't in the area at the time of our stay.",9.0
"This listing was perfect for a quick 3-day weekend trip. Karl set us up with instructions for check-in, and we had no problems getting in and setting up early in the day. Parking was great; we got lucky and found a fantastic spot around the corner where we were able to leave the car from Friday when we arrived until Sunday when we left. A big selling point for us was that bikes were included; we had a great time riding around the city and not having to worry about where we would park our car. Overall, we had a great stay and enjoyed experiencing a new area of Montreal",9.0
"Karl was very gracious and always available to answer any questions we had during our stay. The home was very clean and comfortable, the location was absolutely perfect for exploring the city and we felt very safe. We had no complaints at all.",9.0
"This was a delightful apartment. The location was great. We could walk to Old Montreal and the Latin Quarter in about 40 minutes, and approximately the same to Mont Royal (I can't quite remember the exact timings). Very close to restaurants on Ste Catherine and also Crescent St.  

Karl was very helpful. We didn't meet him but he sent instructions as to how to get into the apartment and also very helpful and detailed parking instructions/tips. 

The air conditioning was great, especially on such a hot weekend. We didn't really use the kitchen at all except to store a few things in the fridge, so I can't comment on the kitchen really, but overall this was a good choice to stay at in Montreal. Thanks for letting us stay there Karl! ☺",9.0
Nice place to stay. Easy to get around and close to many shops and restaurants. Karl answered all our questions and was very easy to contact.,9.0
"While Karl's place was clean and centrally located, it definitely had a deep bachelor vibe; personal touches like the plants and some of the artwork shown in photos of the apartment were absent, leaving the place feeling a little Spartan. Also not accurately depicted was the somewhat ripped and shabby furniture in the living room. Ok, so maybe not the best place for a thirty-something married couple, but for those seeking an affordable spot in Montreal, this was hard to beat. What to expect: The pros: A great location, walkable to tons of restaurants downtown, and a fifteen-minute walk to Atwater Market and a couple of metro stations. Also close by was a little park, which screens movies on some summer evenings. A well-equipped kitchen - being in Montreal will make you want to binge on good food. With the markets so close, you may want to prepare your own meal (we just gorged on bread and cheese, mainly, but a fridge and toaster made this easy). A charming old building - lots of nice architectural touches like plaster molding, big windows and high ceilings gave the apartment an airy feel. It was clean (mostly) - the floors felt freshly cleaned, the linens were crisp and there were a couple of freshly washed towels. While there was still some trash and recycling from the previous guest, none of it was stinky, so not too bad. The cons: Parking - while Karl had ample direction in what the parking was like in the area, it was still a bit of a pain; when no street parking was available, we had to park at a meter overnight and be up and back at the car by 7am to either move it or pay. As this is a densely populated area, parking gripes come with the territory, but if you don't have to drive, you will have one less thing to think about. Transients - while I don't mind telling a guy ""I'm not interested"" when he's trying to sell me wine or stolen nail polish out of his backpack, some people might. Again, it's downtown, and this isn't the Ritz. Communication: As not everyone traveling to Canada internationally has the ability to text freely, it might be good to get instructions on how to get into the apartment in advance. While I told Karl of our travel plans, and when we expected to get there, he told me that there would be a lockbox with a key, but not the location of the lockbox or the combination, so we had to stand on the porch with our bags for a little while while we texted Karl for the rest of the necessary information we needed to gain access. He responded within a few moments, but having the info in advance would have been cooler. Bottom line - if you are looking for affordable access to Montreal and don't mind hanging out on dorm-quality furniture, this place is tops. 22-year-old...",9.0
"Karl was a very helpful host and staying in his apartment was a blast. If there was ever anything we needed, he would offer to help and was very good at communicating with us throughout the entire stay. We couldn't have picked a better location with the metro station and shops all at our doorstep. His apartment has so much character and we would stay there again. Cheers Karl!",9.0
"Karl's place was absolutely perfect! The location can't be beat - so close to the Metro and tons of amazing restaurants - and such a perfect size for exactly what I needed. Karl was incredibly helpful and quick to respond to any questions I asked, and I had such an amazing time. I would 100% recommend this place. Merci!!",9.0
"Karl was very welcoming and communicative throughout my stay. The apartment is a cozy one-bedroom, and everything is old but charming. Relics like the little gas stove and the freestanding tub/shower combo were interesting but not inconvenient.

My favorite part was the bicycles (Karl has about five of different sizes and styles) that made it really easy to get around more comfortably than Montreal's Bixi system. It was also nice to be greeted by the landlord's huge fluffy Samoyed and the neighbor's Persian cat.",9.0
"We didn't meet Karl, but his check-in system worked well for us. Like others said, this is an old apartment and the lock is a little sticky (Tip: turn left to open the door and right to lock it). My wife and I like the feeling of living in the antique atmosphere. This is a perfect location to explore Montreal and there are plenty of good restaurants within 5 minutes' walk. The parking spots are very popular, but we can always find a spot (Tip: read the sign carefully).",9.0
"We had an amazing time. Karl was easy to contact any day. The location was great! Super close to all the shopping you can imagine. Old town was easy to get to, and we were able to use Karl's bikes but also took a long walk on another day. We also realized right before we left just how close we were to Mount Royal and hiked there from Karl's place.",9.0
Great apartment in a nice area. Parking space hunting is really time-consuming though...,9.0
"Had a great stay at Karl's place. It depends on what you are looking for, but it's well located and close to Montreal's more commercial side, with shopping, bars, and nightlife. Also, a highlight is having the bikes available at your disposal. Parc Royal lookout is only a short ride away and definitely recommended at sunset or in the morning. Karl was super helpful and communicative.

The area has some character and the apartment does have a certain student vibe, but for the price and location as a solo traveler or couple, I would definitely recommend it.",9.0

There were some misunderstandings upon arrival but Karl was very quick to resolve them and all in all we had a really good impression of Karl. I would absolutely recommend his apartment if you want a cozy and spacious place, and the location is great.

When we missed our train from Montreal, Karl was super nice and let us stay in the apartment after check out! Thanks!",9.0

Parking was a bit confusing to figure out (definitely ask beforehand for a map or something if you don't get service in Canada). The place was nice and charming, and Karl helped us book a reservation for a restaurant when we didn't have phone service. He communicates very quickly!",9.0

Grocery stores and cafes are located near the house. The housing itself is clean, warm, beautiful, in a pleasant neighborhood. 
We have never seen the owner personally, but Karl was very helpful in solving all our questions quickly. We found interesting places to visit on the list of recommendations, a trip to Comedy Nest was excellent! :)

"We were very happy with our stay. The apartment had all the amenities we could need, it was near great restaurants, and was very easy to use. It was near a subway, but it's a bit far from most of the key spots if you're visiting for a few days. Parking on the street was great if you can find a spot in a free zone and keep it there, but it was difficult to figure out where to put it during the one-hour street sweeping. The wifi worked well, the area was quiet enough to sleep well, and the air conditioning was nice. The only real downside for us was that the apartment is not really suitable for tall people. The bed is very short with a footboard that made my husband have to sleep on the pull-out couch (not comfortable!). His head also stuck out of the shower. Other than that, it was a great apartment for our needs and we recommend it.",9.0

"Karl's apartment had an excellent location and ample space! While parking on the street might seem challenging due to required resident stickers, we easily found parking using Karl's detailed map. The location was right near a metro stop and just a couple of blocks from St. Catherine Street! There was also a grocery store not far away. The walk to the old city took about 25-30 minutes, and we enjoyed being able to go many places from this location! We couldn't use the bikes because it was raining, but it was nice to know they were available! Karl was accommodating with communication methods since we didn't have data and could only use Wi-Fi intermittently. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Karl!",9.0
"Karl's dwelling reminded us of a classic Peterburg building. The apartment had character and a unique atmosphere. It was spacious and very sunny. Shops, restaurants, and public transportation stops were within walking distance. 

Disadvantages: the building is old, there is no elevator, and to reach the second floor you will have to climb two rather steep and narrow staircases. Construction work is taking place in the neighboring building at this time, which sometimes starts as early as 7 am. A conditioner is available in the bedroom, but it's not completely silent, but it does its job.",9.0
"Really charming little apartment in a very good location. Karl was very helpful in sorting out everything, from the door-locking techniques to the wifi.  
Walking distance to plenty of good restaurants and downtown. Not too far if you fancy a walk up the mountain too.",9.0
Karl was a gracious host who responded quickly to all of our questions. The property itself was very charming and provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay.,9.0
"Karl is extremely communicative and accommodating. The apartment features charming Victorian details and is centrally located, especially near good restaurants and a market.",9.0
Great location! Only a 5-minute walk to the metro station and many restaurants and grocery stores. The apartment was cozy and had everything you would need for a weekend getaway.,9.0
Would highly recommend Karl's place. Karl himself was very helpful in answering questions considering this was our first time using Airbnb. The location is excellent. It's a very short walk to Rue Ste Catherine which has a bunch of very good restaurants (I would highly recommend SamCha to anyone who likes Asian food -- it blew me away.) Also a short walk to the metro. Would definitely stay here again if we make another trip to Montreal.,9.0
"This place was very cute and had everything we needed. We were able to borrow bikes, which was great. The espresso machine is also awesome. Close to the subway and a commercial strip.",9.0
"My wife and I spent a weekend at Karl's place. The location is great. We were able to easily find parking in front of the apartment several times over the weekend.

We never actually met Karl, but that was not a problem at all. Karl was great at communicating with us and we were able to easily get into the apartment without him there.

The apartment is accurately represented and we would definitely recommend staying there.",9.0
"My girlfriend and I wanted to go to Montreal for a week-long trip. We found Karl's place and it checked all the boxes. 

Location: It's centrally located near the metro(s) which are the best way to get around the city. Also within walking distance of Mount Royal, which was very welcome as that was on our destination list. There's also a mall nearby so if you need a pharmacy or anything it's easily found. Timmy HoHo's is nearby as well if you want your caffeine fix. 

Cleanliness: Very clean and well-kept. Had no issues with the condition of the apartment. 

Style: high ceilings and very similar to a pre-war place in NYC if you're familiar with it. We really liked it and the price for what we got. 

Note on parking: We drove up and parked my car in a nearby lot for $52 (CAD) for 4 days ($13/day). It was easier than dealing with moving my car and street cleaning. Parking in the area does require placards for certain times and free parking isn't necessarily in the immediate area. Karl said he could provide info on parking, but I didn't ask about it and just decided to leave my car in a lot. 

Overall, I liked the place and was very happy with the trip. Karl is a great host and kept in contact throughout the trip.",9.0
"Very close to St. Catherine's Street. Parking is difficult, with limited spaces. We were fortunate twice but unlucky once when we had to pay. Karl is excellent at communication and responded to our messages very quickly.",9.0
"Karl's place is really charming and looks exactly like the pictures. There was an issue in the apartment once, and Karl came the same day to fix it. Communication was very easy and relaxed. It's close to the metro and just a few minutes walking distance from St. Catherine's street.",9.0
"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful two weeks staying at Karl's while in Montreal! The apartment is very large, spacious, and classic Montreal style with cool wooden floors and a big claw foot tub. The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed! Check-in and check-out was very easy as Karl provided clear instructions and we had great communication with him whenever we needed anything. 

The apartment is in an ideal location - you can walk absolutely everywhere, from Atwater market (10 mins) to the metro (<5 mins), to great grocery stores steps away, a couple of Tim Hortons for epic Canadian coffee, and all major downtown areas like St. Catherine's, Quartier de Spectacles, le Village, St Denis, St Laurent, Little Burgundy, St Henri, etc., Really it's ideal! It's also a very quiet area so we were never disturbed, and had lots of privacy. 

We actually booked this apartment because we had booked another property months ago, and the host suddenly cancelled - we were really stressed when it happened but are now so happy it did because we were able to stay in this apartment instead, and it's much more our style. I loved it, and would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Montreal.",9.0
"What a charming flat!! Old wood everywhere, colored glass windows, vintage decoration... and still a really comfortable bed! The flat is exactly as shown on the pictures, and I've had an excellent stay. I didn't meet Karl in person, but he was very responsive during my stay, and left precise instructions for check-in and check-out. An added bonus was that I could use his bike to get around... Overall, I'll happily come back next year!",9.0
"Clean, easy check-in, good communication. We were lucky to find parking right outside the apartment. The apartment is located two blocks from St. Catherine's Street and only a few minutes walk from downtown. It's also close to a metro station, although we mostly walked everywhere to experience the city. Would definitely stay again.",9.0
"Great location and a great host! Thank you for a wonderful stay, Karl!",9.0
"Karl's place is THE Montreal experience. Having lived in Montreal for the first 25 years of my life, it was just like being home. The location is right downtown and walkable to everywhere I wanted to be. The apartment itself was clean, uncluttered and cozy. I loved the fireplace and stained glass windows. My friend and I both agreed we'd move back to Montreal if we could get an apartment like Karl's!",9.0
"Our stay with Karl was very pleasant. The apartment is nice, particularly when there's sunshine as it's very well-exposed. The decor and the floor give a lot of character to the place. There's a slightly ""vintage"" feel due to the age of the apartment but that's what makes its charm! In the city center, it offers an excellent value for money! We are close to everything, especially Rue Ste Catherine, which is convenient for finding restaurants. Communication with Karl has always been very simple and quick. We didn't meet him in person, but there was a check-in box that allowed us to arrive when we could.",9.0
"This was by far the best place I have stayed at in Montreal and I've been a few times. You can't beat the location. The beautiful old-style apartment is a short walk from St Catherine and Crescent. Concordia is also within walking distance. Karl was very helpful with giving tips on which gyms were nearby, etc. The bikes were a big plus for us too. I hope to stay here again next time I'm in Montreal! Thanks again, Karl",9.0
"A lovely apartment in a great location. Really perfect for my 10-day work visit to Montreal. Having access to a washer/dryer made it easy for me to travel light. And I appreciated the small touches like providing an HDMI cable for the TV, which allowed me to watch my favorite trashy TV shows on my Netflix account.",9.0
"Great location, close to the metro. We never met Karl as he was at work when we arrived, but his communication was excellent and we had no trouble finding the place. Highly recommend.",9.0
"Karl's place is great! It's a cozy apartment on a quiet side street, yet so close to everything. Karl is a great host and made our stay very easy, including plenty of information with timely responses. He let us use his bikes which was amazing! Almost anywhere you want to go in a 25 minute ride or less. Thanks Karl!",9.0
"Great space! Went during a heat wave and the air conditioning in the bedroom was a lifesaver, especially in an old Victorian home (which retains heat a lot). Pretty central to downtown and Karl was very quick to respond to any of our questions.

Multiple Bixi locations in the surrounding area and right near two Metro stations.",9.0
Great place. Great location. Perfect base to explore Montreal from.,9.0
"Comfortable apartment very well located for metro, bus and shops. Very comfortable bed. However, the sofa bed is not very comfortable. Shame... Thank you for a quick response to a last-minute rental. Natalie",9.0
"The best thing about this place is its location, which is close to the metro, bus stops, and within walking distance of St. Catherine's. Parking is relatively easy; you can park on the street (read the signs carefully), and some parking garages are not far away. 

Overall, I thought the Airbnb was worth the price. The place might be a little tight for four people, as Karl mentioned, but we made it work. I would suggest bringing your own shower essentials though.",9.0
"The photos of the apartment are accurate. The location is just on the outskirts of what is officially ""downtown"" (aka Centre-Ville), a block from Atwater Avenue, a big neighborhood border of sorts. It suited me because I could walk to classes I was taking downtown, and because, courtesy of the bicycle that came with the apartment, I could easily access the trails around the Lachine Canal, take advantage of the great farmers market plus known as the Atwater market, and explore neighborhoods west (like Westmount, etc.). When you first arrive you might think, oh, the entry stairs look a little shabby, etc.. but otherwise the apartment is great inside, and the neighborhood is good, if perhaps a little off-beat. A block or two in either direction are gorgeous looking row houses, etc, that would probably cost twice as much, if they were available, so I consider this an EXCELLENT value overall. AC worked (important for the summer), laundry facilities in the bathroom (excellent for my two week stay, etc.).",9.0
"The location was convenient for the event I was attending, given the many bike lanes in the area, and the apartment was comfortable with most amenities including good wifi. It was great that it had A/C in the bedroom and a fan in the front room. We liked the green bike that was included and used it to get around. The apartment block had lots of colorful characters, though the children's playground directly opposite kept things sweeter. All in all, a good trip & experience.",9.0
"My stay at Karl's apartment was just fantastic! Karl is an amazing host and the check-in process could not have been better.  The location of Karl's beautiful apartment is perfect for a stay in Montreal: close to the metro, beautiful parks, downtown.  And the apartment itself is cozy and gorgeous: what a great way to visit a city when feeling immediately at home, and that is exactly how I felt in Karl's wonderful apartment.  Will cross fingers that - whenever I am back in Montreal - Karl's apartment will be available! Don't want to stay anywhere else. Thank you, Karl, for being such a great host. Sofia",9.0
"I was excited to stay at this place after reading some positive reviews, but to be completely honest myself, and the guest were disappointed.

My biggest complaint was that this apartment was in desperate need of a deep clean. It was clear this has not happened for a long time, if ever. At one point, I looked beneath the couch where I was sleeping, and there was at least 2 inches of caked filth, dirt, and dust. Then I began to notice it was all over the house. The shower was dirty and the shower curtain was stained, like it had not been changed for some time. Both of the doors are hard to lock, the front door and door to the apartment (not Karl's fault, but just a warning). When you walk into the hallway of the building you are hit with a stench of natural gas (Karl said that the owner of the building is decommissioning some of the old gas pipes, so there might be a residual odor). I understand that this is an old apartment, but even more reason to try to clean it better and remove some of the junk. The house is really cluttered with all kinds of stuff.

To top it off, the neighbors had a big party on Saturday night until 4 or 5 in the morning. Kept me up most of the night playing techno and yelling outside. Obviously this is not Karl's fault, but I get the feeling this happens somewhat often as the building and neighbors had a frat vibe. It was amusing that the ""house rules"" say not to have parties, well maybe that's because you can just join the one next door.

On a positive note, Karl was nice and responsive, but I don't feel that makes up for the condition of the house and lack of cleanliness.",9.0
"Karl's apartment was perfect for our week-long stay in Montreal. We didn't get to meet Karl as he was away, but his communication and check-in/out process was impressive. He was very diligent, and the bikes were an extra plus. 

It's close to everything you need, and the size of the apartment was very decent for Montreal. We were very happy!",9.0
"Karl's place is great - easily accessible from the airport, close to shops and restaurants, and very homey!",9.0

"We loved this quaint, authentic ""Montrealesque"" apartment. In a quiet location but close to everything. Had a wonderful time.",9.0
"Karl's apartment was a warm and welcoming haven from some chilly days in Montreal! The space itself is cozy but roomy. It has some beautiful trim and other historic details, including a gorgeous stained glass window in the bedroom and a lovely mantle in the living room. It is centrally located within walking distance of scores of excellent restaurants and bars on vibrant Saint Catherine's Street and also within walking distance of a lovely neighborhood strip of shops to the south, near the canal. It’s a longish walk or a quick drive from the old port, and only 15 minutes from the airport. Karl gave clear directions, was available and responsive, and overall an excellent host.",9.0
"If you're looking for Victorian charm in Montreal at a great price, Karl's apartment is the place for you. We especially enjoyed the beautiful fireplace, cozy kitchen, stained glass and big claw foot tub - tres charmant! The apartment is also near to lots of amenities and great places to eat. Checking in and out were a breeze and we were especially grateful for all the info Karl provided on nearby parking. We will definitely try to stay here next time we are in the city!",9.0

"The place is very nice. The location is perfect - the house was next to a park within a very quiet community, but also just one block away from a main street with lots of restaurants. The rooms are very clean and organized. We did not meet Micheline since we arrived late but still got the keys and all the information we needed.",10.0
"We spent a lovely week at Micheline's beautiful apartment in one of Montreal's most engaging neighborhoods. The apartment was bright and spacious, and equipped with everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and we slept soundly. I would have thought there would be more street noise right in town but it really was not noticeable.

The location was perfect - since the weather was fine we lingered often in the Square St Louis. The cafe on the square is not only convenient, it has the best coffee we've had in a long time and delicious sandwiches. Many many other restaurants were just a short walk away. We also used the Bixi bike rental stand on the square to borrow bikes for an outing to nearby Parc la Fontaine, which is also within walking distance if you prefer not to bike.

Micheline was easily reached by phone and text. I would definitely stay here again.",10.0

"Marcos & Mari were great hosts. Marcos replied by text within an hour whenever I had a question or concern.

The location was perfect. Two blocks from Rue Berri & St Catherine by the Berri-UQAM train station. Just far enough to not hear the crowds for Fierte, but close enough to walk out to the festivities.

The apt was immaculately clean! My friend said it was so clean, she was scared to walk in it haha. Also, I enjoyed the simple and modern furnishings. It would be as if I had furnished it myself, so I really felt at home :).

I really enjoyed having the privacy of the apt and being stress free in a safe building. The air conditioner worked perfectly against the scorching heat outside! The smart TV is great for bringing your own media to play. I had music and concerts in MP3, MP4, MKV, and AVI formats which all worked to my surprise! 

Also, the bed in the bedroom is a lot bigger than the photo looks! I think the photo ""squished"" the bed haha. It's at least a queen size I think.",9.0

This location was perfect for walking or taking the Metro 2 blocks away.

And given Montreal's confusing street parking rules, it was nice to have indoor parking and not worry about tickets! We would return.",9.0
"Marcos and Mari's apartment was the perfect spot for our long weekend in the city -- clean, centrally located and conveniently close to a variety of transit. The pick-up instructions for the keys were extremely clear and well communicated. 

One small note: the residents do live here full time... from the photos we were not expecting to find a full fridge, computers, full closets, etc. Not a huge deal, but it took a bit of navigating to ensure we weren't unintentionally invading their privacy.

All in all, highly recommended!",9.0
"The apartment was very clean and had plenty of amenities such as clean towels, sheets, and cookware. We enjoyed the easy walk to downtown and Old Port area.

"We enjoyed our stay here and would come back/recommend to others!

Marcos was easy to get in touch with before arrival and for check-in, and he was patient in addressing my questions and helping me check in.

The apartment was clean, comfortable, and well-furnished. Marcos and Mari were excellent hosts: they made sure to post the Wi-Fi password throughout the apartment; they laid out fresh towels, shampoo, and soaps; they made up a tray of coffee and goodies; and they even left us a letter to welcome us and wish us well on our trip. 

The neighborhood is very well-situated (close to Chinatown, two Metro stops, Old Montreal, Rue St. Catherine, and the highway). The closest grocery store is about a 10-15 minute walk away. The underground parking was very convenient. If you're planning to travel to Montreal over the summer (2016), be aware that there's tons of construction which will affect how you get to the underground parking and around the city (not a deal-breaker but make sure to plan ahead!).",9.0

He was responsive throughout the process and we never waited more than a minute to get an answer on an inquiry.  The location was outstanding! Heart of Old Montreal, steps away from Notre Dame, Rue St Paul & the water. A great breakfast spot called Tutti Frutti is very close by as well. We will definitely be going back and will be recommending to others.",10.0
"The apartment is in a great modern building, very close to old Montreal/Notre Dame, etc. There is a subway/metro station right across the road, so there are lots of shops, restaurants, and supermarkets nearby.

It is tastefully decorated, exactly like the pictures, and everything you could possibly need is catered for. Having the utility room with the washer and dryer in the apartment itself was very useful for us as we were on a long trip traveling with a baby.

Overall communication, as well as check-in/check-out, was seamless. Very happy with the stay and would happily come back here",10.0

From the kitchen to the bathroom and bedroom, my partner and I have nothing bad to say about this place or the location. The location was absolutely fantastic and quiet. 

The condo was very clean and exactly as pictured. A washer and dryer in the apartment made laundry super convenient. Parking is located within the building for a fee. We had a great view from the corner apartment with beautiful expansive windows. Neighbors were very quiet. The building itself was well kept and is a 5-minute walk from the metro station, lots of great restaurants and bars, and Notre-Dame Basilica. 

Be aware that most of OLD DOWNTOWN does close early. But it's definitely not as busy and touristy as DOWNTOWN, which was a huge plus for my partner and me. 

We definitely look forward to staying here again.",10.0

"We had to change our travel plans at the last minute to avoid driving in a winter storm, but Claude was very understanding and accommodating. The condo is beautiful and in a wonderful location. The place was pristine and comfortable, especially the lovely little electric fireplace! The building was easy to access and super quiet. Parking instructions were a little unclear but Claude is extremely communicative and responded to our inquiries almost immediately.  

The condo is within walking distance to numerous small shops and cafes, and right around the corner from the Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal. There is a metro stop within comfortable walking distance, but we did not use it much. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here, and would consider visiting again in the future.",10.0

Claude was a great host. The weather forecast changed to freezing rain on the night of our arrival, and Claude was very accommodating in changing the reservation to the following night. He met us upon arrival with the parking pass and door key. He also messaged us when we arrived and the following morning to make sure everything was alright.

We would definitely recommend staying at this condo!",10.0

"Exactly as advertised. It's a beautiful, spacious, clean, well-kept, and Claude was a great host, answering all our questions promptly. It's a little pricey but it felt like staying at a brand new luxury hotel as opposed to a lived-in apartment, and it was in the same price range as all the decent hotels in the area but with much more space, a view, privacy, and a kitchen. Comfy bed, big bathtub, lovely for a little getaway for my boyfriend and me. Steps from beautiful Old Montreal but away from the crowds. We even got lucky and found street parking around the corner, which was free all night and most of Saturday/Sunday. Wish we could have stayed longer!",10.0

"This was my first experience booking with Airbnb, Claude's apartment on the 14th floor was absolutely amazing! The place, the location, the ease of check-in and check-out before and after, and the bed was so comfy too! I would go back in a heartbeat. I was very timid to book my vacation this way instead of a hotel but I am so pleased I did. The window views, the location was key, you had everything around you. Bring good shoes because you'll need them for 3 nights and about 24 miles of walking... it was great! Full kitchen if you like to pick up a few groceries or snacks. The only tiny thing I wish I had was a fan, it seemed to get warm in the apartment and you couldn't adjust the air to your liking. Other than that, no complaints and we can't wait to go back! You must try this place.",10.0
"The apartment was very comfortable and made my 5-night trip to Montreal for work much more homey. The kitchen was well-equipped with basics as well as coffee, and the place had everything I needed. It was very clean and the bed and couch were very comfy. Despite being downtown, the apartment was quiet. The only thing that wasn't great was the strong smell from air fresheners the building has placed in the hallways. If you are scent-sensitive or prone to headaches from smells, I would caution you about this. If not, it's a fantastic spot to stay. :)",10.0

"Good place, comfy bed and sofa, located in old Montreal, perfect for traveling around the area. A little difficult to find parking, especially since Montreal is mostly one-way streets. The maximum height of the bed can't be adjusted higher. There were a few bugs at night (uncontrollable).",10.0

Apart from the fridge, the bathroom, and the bedroom in the basement that we had to clean up on arrival, the apartment is spacious with a large garden and two bedrooms. Kitchen, dining room, and living room. However, the fact that it wasn't completely renovated made our stay more comfortable for the kids... 
The situation is not bad, but with little ones, it was quite isolated and a bit far from dense areas of activities. I loved the Italian grocery store two blocks away from the house!",8.0

"While the host can work on dusting the place (and washbasin block) before a guest arrives, the place is good as it is located close to shops and accessible by public transport.
I would also recommend guests to carry their own kettle or microwave or a vessel if they are traveling with infants and want hot water.",8.0
"Andrea's place is cozy and funky at the same time. It's an apartment in a standard two-story older Montreal building with the usual issues that come with age. We felt right at home here, much better than a sterile hotel! The location is perfect; one block from a busy street that we never heard any noise from. It's a quiet neighborhood with little traffic on the street out front. A metro station and large grocery store and drugstore are a two-minute walk, so you can get any necessities and easily get anywhere in Montreal. You don't need a car to navigate the city from here. Andrea communicated clearly and accurately described her apartment and neighborhood. Most enjoyable, thanks!",8.0

The house is located near some of the places we had on our agenda to visit, like the Olympic Park, Biodome, and Botanical Gardens. If you come by car, there's enough free parking around, and if you plan to use public transport, there's a subway station within 5 minutes walking distance.

If we go back to Montreal, we will probably stay at his house.",10.0
"I was really happy that Aurelien was very flexible with my arrival time. I checked in really late because my bus from Toronto got delayed and he would find a way to check me in. Unfortunately, due to conflicting schedules we never met but I had no problems at all. The stay was nice... In a very quiet neighborhood despite being quite a distance from downtown. There is a lovely local market nearby which was also very nice. Thanks Aurelien!",10.0
"The room is everything as described in the listing. A very convenient location which is a couple minutes walk from the Viau Metro station and is next to the Olympic Stadium. I got a C$18 metro pass and I could go almost everywhere in Montreal. One tip is if you arrive late, you better get something to eat at the airport before coming, since there is NOTHING open after 9pm... well, later I found there is a diner about 20min walking which open till 3am, but definitely nothing for personal cares like soap or shampoo. I had to take the Metro back to UQAM (7 stations) to get MacDonald, but still couldn't find those cleaning products…

Use (Hidden by Airbnb) Map wisely…

Aurelien is nice but I only met him twice in the 6 days stay... Once when I arrived and the next was the night before leaving, when I was doing laundry… 

The only thing I didn't feel comfortable is there's no lock on my room door... As coming to a new place and I don't know the people inside the apartment, I felt not quite secure…",10.0

So for me, that wasn't always easy - but it was clean, practical, and quiet. I hardly knew if my host was around which is how I like it. He was very courteous of my privacy.

The bed is comfortable and the room is well-furnished. 

Good location too, the accommodation is located very close to a metro station and allows you to reach the city center very quickly.

In summary, I am very satisfied with the room offered by Aurélien.",10.0

The apartment was clean and suitable for two people who stayed there for a few days in Montreal.",10.0
"It was a great experience. The access to the apartment was simple and convenient, allowing us to be flexible with our time. The place is very nice, functional with all one might need for a comfortable stay. Free parking on the street. There are restaurants, cafes, and shops nearby as well as Jean Talon market with fresh produce and a great selection of cheeses. 

Communication with the host was easy, constructive, and positive. I have already recommended it to a friend and I would definitely stay there again.",9.0
"The apartment was clean and well-located (near the Jean Talon market), we found parking on the street and were close to public transportation. The apartment was equipped with everything we needed for a pleasant stay. Communication with Genevieve was good and efficient.",9.0

"This place is a must-stay. The place makes you feel welcome. Beautiful apartment. Bed was incredibly comfortable. Stay in this place if you're into art. I would stay here again without hesitation. Unfortunately, we didn't get to stay here much because my girlfriend and I were out and about. Host was on point! Highly recommend",9.0
"We had a wonderful stay at Geneviève's beautiful condo. The kitchen was fully stocked and the dishwasher was a nice bonus since we cooked a couple meals, and the bathroom was perfect (loved the rainfall shower head!). We hit the snooze button a few times because their bed was super comfortable. And once we woke up we enjoyed an espresso from their machine on the patio deck. One night we connected our computer to their tv via HDMI and enjoyed a movie.  The wifi was also strong allowing us to use it outside on the patio or front porch. We loved the neighbourhood too because it's close to Jean Talon Market and practically every street has a bike path so we biked everywhere (you can rent scooters and ebikes at Dyad to get around faster). There are a bunch of parks nearby, and Little Italy, Rue St. Denis, Mont Royal and Mile X are a short bike ride or walk away. We also found parking on the street right in front of the house without issue. Geneviève was a great host too. She was very responsive. The key exchange was easy since she left the key in a lockbox (much safer than the usual mailbox method). And she wrote down a bunch of amazing restaurant suggestions that we tried... They were amazing! 

Don't hesitate - a fantastic stay awaits you!",9.0
"We had a fantastic time at Geneviève's place! The accommodation was well-located, close to the metro and shops, and also tastefully decorated. We had everything we needed readily available. We didn't get the chance to meet her but the instructions left were clear and we didn't need anything else. In short, I recommend it! :)",9.0
"I can't say enough about how easy it was to book this place.  It was easy to find, the flatbook was incredibly accommodating and responsive. The place looked exactly as in the pictures. It was clean, with everything you need for a weekend trip.",9.0
"The host was punctual and very friendly. The flat was immaculately clean and matched the description. The neighborhood was incredibly quiet despite being very close to excellent shops, restaurants, parks, and downtown.",9.0
"The location and apartment were perfect! We loved the cleanliness and coziness of the entire place. Shane contacted us directly the morning after arrival, he was professional and helpful and provided all the information we needed. We do wish that our unit had air conditioning as we felt very hot and muggy throughout the night.
Great overall experience!",9.0
"Flatbook hospitality team did a great job with frequent emails and follow-ups to make sure we were greeted at the home. We were running late, so they shared the key code for the main door. The home was nicely maintained, fresh linens on the beds and towels and toiletries were provided. There were 3 queen beds and a twin day bed which was more than enough for our party of 6. The living room was small, but that was fine since we were out most of the day. The place is in a great location, walking distance to the main walking streets and restaurants (St. Laurent Blvd, St. Denis, etc.).

The area does remain rather active late into the night, so there's street noise coming in (people talking/shouting, police cars, etc.) to the unit if you leave the windows open at night. There's no central air (we were there in the summer), but fans were provided in every room. It was still fairly hot inside with the windows open.

Overall the stay was pleasant, location is great. Parking is not provided, you have to go to the closest main street (Sherbook St) to find parking for the day/night.",9.0
"Comfortable, modern, clean, well-equipped place to stay for our family of four. Great location with lots of restaurants, shops, etc., within easy walking distance. All fixtures and appliances are new and in excellent condition. Would absolutely stay here again.

Note that the apartment is on the second floor, accessed by an exterior metal curved staircase.",9.0
"Great place for our group of four. Excellent location, close to restaurants, gas stations, bakeries, and all the good stuff you can find in Montreal. The apartment is as advertised, attractive, comfortable, clean, well-equipped, with nice linens and towels. Flatbook people are very helpful. We would definitely book it again.",9.0
"Great place. Enough space for everyone. However, the front steps were a bit precarious (steep and not entirely stable).",9.0
"This apartment was perfect for our party of four. There were four small bedrooms, each with a comfy bed (three queen beds and one twin), and the living room area was perfect for a rest after a long day exploring the city. Boulevard Saint-Laurent is just a block over and has a ton of nice cafes, restaurants, and bars, and the Vieux-Port is a 20-30 minute walk from the apartment. The area seemed to get pretty crowded with a teenage party crowd on the Friday and Saturday nights we were there, which made the two front bedrooms a little noisy as their windows face the street.

The Flatbook team was very responsive and organized. They got in touch with me right away to exchange details and to make sure all was arranged before our arrival. The apartment was clean, and the Flatbook guidebook that was provided was a nice resource. Overall, a great stay. Thank you!",9.0
"The apartment matched the description. Flatbook provided us with ample supplies such as shampoo, extra Kleenex, etc. Everything was clean and pleasant, just as you would expect from a hotel. We were satisfied with our experience and would stay here again.",9.0
"Recommended address! Super charming neighborhood, commercial, walkable or bikeable! Very clean, functional apartment, very quiet and friendly. Exterior access staircase a bit steep. The Flatbook team takes good care of you. Excellent first experience with Airbnb!",9.0
"We booked a flatbook apartment a month before our trip to Montreal. We chose that specific apartment because it has four separate bedrooms for the four of us and because of the proximity to McGill university. The problem was that there was no hot water in the shower!!! In the Canadian weather of -2 to 10 degrees, it did not make any sense to us. We asked for it to be repaired, but although they tried, it didn't change at all. We were offered to move to a different apartment, but the apartments offered were not as close to the university and had only three bedrooms. We do want to mention that in all other aspects, the apartment was great and flatbook also helped us get a large taxi to go to the airport. But ultimately, we had a week of cold showers which made for a really bad experience overall. When we book an apartment, it's a basic expectation.",9.0
"This apartment was great. It was just as advertised, very clean, and for the most part well-equipped. Its location was absolutely perfect. It is right in the heart of the plateau and an easy walk to Parc Mont Royale, Ave. St. Denis, Ave. St. Laurent, and even to McGill University. A truly central location.

The heat in the main room did not work when we arrived in the evening but Flatbook was very responsive and it was fixed by mid-day the next day. 

This is a great apartment for a group who needs several bedrooms. The key code entry was also wonderful as we did not need to share a key. People could come and go.",9.0
Great place! Fantastic location. This space was perfect for our family who needed space. The steps are steep (and icy in winter) so be careful.,9.0
"The Flatbook team was excellent in accommodating us. The place was very clean and well-equipped with the necessities for a weekend stay. There were issues with the heating at the beginning which was quickly resolved, and any request was answered and satisfied by the Flatbook team. Very close to downtown life and attractions. Amazing and comforting for the six of us who stayed here.",9.0
Everything was great with the booking! Nice and tidy place and no surprises.,9.0
"The place was well-kept and ready on time. The only issues were no cable TV, the water in the shower wouldn't get hot, and parking could sometimes be difficult on the street.",9.0
"Overall positive experience, however there were some complications after checkout. Just make sure to inspect the apartment and take photos of anything that may not look right, and be sure to leave the apartment spotless at checkout.",9.0
"I traveled to Montreal and stayed at Flatbook with 5 friends. It was PERFECT! Best location. Super comfortable. When I return to Montreal, I would definitely stay here again! The Flatbook team was very helpful. Thank you!",9.0
Great location and a nice place - perfect for a weekend in Montreal!,9.0
I was in Montreal with my lab group for a biomaterials conference. The flat is cute and in a safe neighborhood near McGill and the convention center. It was fantastic! Everything was new and very clean. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.,9.0
"Great location! Very helpful host. The apartment was clean and tidy. The only minor drawback was that the living room had no direct sunlight, but it was still cozy to hang out in.

Overall, a great place to stay for 3-4 people.",9.0
"The apartment is a real treat and quite comfortable! When we arrived, it was spotless and tidy, and there were even some little extras like popsicles in the freezer. The location is fantastic! Easy and quick access to many restaurants on Rue St. Denis. We stayed between Old Montreal and the commercial area. Excellent stay. Highly recommend!",9.0
"The apartment seemed small for the price, but it worked out just fine for our close-knit family of six.",9.0
Everything went as expected.,9.0
"Check-in was very easy with keypad entry. The room was as described. There were a few things that weren't perfect: lamps with no good location to plug them in, and a dining chair that looked whole but had obviously been broken before. None of it was enough to be a real problem.

We had hot water in the shower, AC, a washing machine that worked (and detergent packets), four cute little bedrooms, and a kitchen. The kitchen had enough pots and pans to cook a feast, a blender, a toaster, and a coffee maker. It was so convenient and easy with the kids. I loved that there wasn't a lot of stuff in it.

It was easy to walk to the train, restaurants, and shops. We found free street parking.

If we were to go back, I would be happy to go back to this place.",9.0
"The apartment had great location, amazing decor, and was very clean. Amazing experience... I would stay here if I came back.",9.0
The location is good. There are many restaurants nearby.,9.0
"Great space for a family of five. Clean and very comfortable. Within three blocks of the subway, but we walked everywhere, including Old Montreal, Chinatown, Notre Dame Basilica, and Mile End.",9.0
This was a very nice spot to stay if you're looking to be near downtown. Quiet street but very close to many restaurants and activities.,9.0
"Lovely apartment in an excellent location close to great restaurants, bars, and shops!",9.0
"I had experienced an issue with the AC, and the team was prompt to send someone over to provide us with fans and help resolve our concerns. The apartment was as described and the location was great for busy restaurant-filled streets! The sheets were comfy, and overall we enjoyed our stay. Thank you Sonder!",9.0
"The apartment was very nice and in an awesome location. It was clean and comfortable. The only downside was that the air conditioning was broken, so the nights were a little hot. There were ample fans though, and the neighborhood was safe enough for us to sleep with the windows open. Amazing bars and restaurants were easily walkable, and the city bike station was only a block or so away.",9.0
"This place is right in the middle of an amazing area. Alot of food and clubs are literally 10 steps around the corner. Easily walkable to everything and the bikes. If you're driving, parking is right outside perfectly available every day and night. There are a lot of fans. The air-conditioning wasn't working at that time but it's okay. Great 4 rooms for 4 people. Great area, it was worth every penny.",9.0
"The apartment is well-located and very clean. It is similar in presentation to an apartment hotel. The bedrooms are comfortable, and the bathroom has a large shower. The only point of improvement for us remains the brightness of the living room which remains dim even during the day.",9.0
"The location of this place was great, being within walking distance of attractions, food, and entertainment. However, there was no heads-up about the lack of air conditioning situation from the time of booking (when it indicated A/C) until check-in, and we noticed how hot it was. The fans provided were okay, despite the few days we stayed being especially hot, and often times, it was hotter inside than out, making the 6 of us quite uncomfortable at night even when we shut off all the lights except the lamp to cool down. Overall, it was a good place to stay for groups with the amount of bedrooms and is accessible to many places by foot.",9.0
"The flat is located in a very lively area (but the street is quiet) and offers easy access to all areas. It has some nice shops and places to eat nearby, and we could park on the street. The flat is very hot as mentioned in other reviews, and the fans did not really help. There is little natural light in the flat, and it's not possible for air to circulate. Only two bedrooms have windows that open.",9.0
"I recommend this apartment, good experience",9.0
Great location and easy check-in. Sonder was very responsive to questions weeks before.,9.0

There's a bit of noise on Thursday to Saturday nights due to the party at Prince-Arthur's side.

"Very well located, good literature and clean, only drawbacks: lack of lighting and chairs for 6 people",9.0
"Great location, very good communication.",9.0
"Good place with average value but had difficulty communicating with the host because it's run by a company, not a private host.  Late check-out, even by an hour, was difficult to arrange and didn't happen.",9.0
"Great place, better than expected and good location. Not pictured is a decent-sized entryway. However, I did not like having to sign up for another online rental website called ""Sonder"" in order to book this place through Airbnb.",9.0
"**Advantages:**  Clean and practical apartment for a short stay. Minimalist decor, Ikea-style but efficient and well heated. Comfortable bedding. Central location, very pleasant, quiet and close to shops and the metro.

**Disadvantages:** Lack of natural light (photos on the site somewhat misleading about brightness). Entrance door not very secure and definitely needs improvement.",9.0
Really great neighborhood. The beds are also really comfortable. Slept like a baby!,9.0
"Great location, comfortable living area with spacious rooms, no AC but they provide enough fans, overall it gets the job done! Would stay again",9.0
It is a nice apartment with a good atmosphere in a great neighborhood full of lively restaurants and bars. Recommends!,9.0
"The apartment is very dark and the environment is noisy (street and building). 

There is a TV but no connection to an internet box so it doesn't work (just an HDMI cable hanging down).

No contact with the host, it's rather a company managing several apartments, just a code to access the apartment.",9.0
"Great location. This is not really bohemian, but it's very functional for a larger group that each gets a bedroom. It was terrific for six of us. The refrigerator made a large noise, but hopefully they will fix it. All in all, a wonderful place to stay in a fantastic neighborhood.",9.0
Very good!,9.0
Great spot.,9.0
"Our host was very helpful in accommodating our group for the weekend. We were able to cook, clean, and do our laundry with ease. The best part about the property is the location - walking distance from restaurants, grocery stores, and nightlife. Would gladly stay at this property again.",9.0

"Three beautiful apartments, their images reflect reality. We would feel like we were in a VIP apartment. 

Annie is an excellent host, available and knows how to put her guests in optimal accommodation conditions. We haven't missed anything. Plus the apartment is located in the heart of a lively area at night. I highly recommend her apartment. You will not be disappointed.",10.0
"Annie has been very responsive and helpful. Her apartment is very nice and I love the place where it is located. It's a very creative and changing area, with everything we needed. Organic vegetarian food is around the corner, along with grocery stores and fresh fruit and vegetable shops, a few nice cheap restaurants and bars. Early opening breakfast dinners. Bookstores and bakeries are also nearby. Bike rental stations are very close as well as the metro and bus station. Perfect location for us.",10.0
Annie was great to us! The place was super clean. She was very accommodating and it had everything we could have needed. Annie was very easy to work with regarding check-in and check-out times. The apartment is very close to good food and the metro station. Thank you for making our time in Montreal that much more enjoyable!,10.0
"This apartment was really nice and huge, and Simplissimo was great. 
Everything was ready when I arrived. No hassle, everything was easy. Also the air-conditioning was turned on, the internet speed was fast, and everything needed was there. Great location close to St. Catherine's with all the shops. I would really recommend this place and Simplissimo too.

Cheers",9.0
"Simplissimmo was helpful and accommodating throughout my stay, and the apartment was excellent. The space was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. The closest metro stop was only a short walk away, so it was easy to make use of Montreal's wonderful public transit system. Simplissimmo made my stay in Montreal simple, comfortable, and relaxing. I can't recommend this apartment enough.",9.0
"The apartment was wonderful, clean, and had everything we needed. The listing description was completely accurate. The location was excellent. It was less than a 5 minute walk to all of the sites/attractions in Old Montreal and was near great restaurants and bars. The instructions for checking in/getting keys were very clear. We are very happy that we stayed here!",9.0
Great place. Exactly as pictured. Amazing location!,9.0
"Unfortunately, this is my first bad Airbnb experience. I would not go through this ""host"" again as it turned out to be a large corporate housing company posing as the owner of the unit. They ran multiple units throughout the city. This is not the welcoming Airbnb model and felt as such. When we tried to reach the ""host,"" we received no replies via Airbnb or the numbers provided until 24 hours after we attempted contact. We had a snowstorm that delayed our arrival, and when we tried to communicate this to the host, we never even heard back from her, which made for a very stressful experience while on the road. The unit itself was very simple and clean but felt more like a cold abandoned studio apartment than a welcoming and warm stay, especially considering the price we expected much more.",9.0
Great location! Enjoyed being able to get on the subway or grab a BIXI bike right out the front door. Has a wonderful French bakery around the corner and easy to walk to numerous restaurants. Wonderful stay and arranging key pickup/drop-off was incredibly simple.,9.0
"Great location and comfortable bed. The fireplace doesn't work, so a bit disappointed. For a long stay, bring your own laundry detergent as there isn't enough provided for more than two loads unless you call to pay for additional supplies.",9.0
"The location was great, the value was great, I just wish check-in was smoother. It's a company that manages multiple Airbnbs so your apartment might look a little different than the one in the pictures but same layout. Communication was good; there is a phone number you can call and through email we got quick responses. I would stay here again.",9.0
"The hosts are awesome and have a great space for couples or two people. It's a nice art studio, simple and it's near everything. We didn't have to take a cab or Uber anywhere. We walked through ""The Village"" which is where this is located and we had tons of cafes, bars, restaurants, and shopping options. It's close to everything that a 20-minute walk would take you to downtown Montreal and the Old Port as well.

This was a great place to stay. We kept our car parked in front of it for three days and no one complained. I would definitely stay there again.",9.0
"Anastasia was an excellent host, very easy to communicate with when making the reservation and flexible to meet up with us on our own schedule. The listing was exactly as described, and we love the neighborhood (Plateau). The bed is a futon which I didn't notice initially, but it was comfortable either way. We would definitely like to stay here again. Thank you so much!",9.0

The bed was too small, but there was an air mattress as an alternative. 
It would be nice if there were some curtains to darken the room at night.",9.0
"This was a beautiful, bright space in a great location!",9.0
"Anastasia was accommodating when it came to our arrival -- we were later than expected, and had experienced cellphone issues when entering Canada, and she was willing to delay her plans for the evening until we arrived soundly. The place was minimal in the best of ways: clean, bright, well-equipped (except for not featuring an actual bed with mattress-- although that should come as no surprise, assuming you actually *read* the listing details), and we found the shower to be more than satisfactory.",9.0
"Ana was a wonderful host! Everything was as shown in the pictures/description. The apartment is perfectly located, allowing us to explore the city on foot without any transportation worries!",9.0
"Parfait little pied-à-terre very well located in the heart of Montreal. 

The studio is spacious, bright and tastefully furnished with a futon that comfortably fits one person, probably a bit too small for a couple. 

The place was ideal for a weekend of creative meetings and projects... the kind of awesome place where I'd see myself living full-time. Bonus points for the excellent Led Zeppelin album on the library: )

Although very lively, the neighborhood is surprisingly quiet considering its central location (two steps from Mont-Royal/St-Denis). The place is sufficiently soundproofed to allow a comfortable night's sleep, but the large windows in front will likely wake you up early once the sun rises. 

Ana is a charming, welcoming and easy-to-reach host who offers an amazing place where I wouldn't hesitate to return for future trips to Montreal!",9.0
"I'm glad I stayed at this apartment during my vacation in Montreal. Anastasia was a very gracious host. She gave me plenty of tips about where to go and what to do, and she was very good about responding to my questions. The neighborhood is a very unique one, close to bars and restaurants and full of life. Anastasia was also very accommodating with my rather early check-out time.",9.0
"Everything was very pleasant, with great communication and a nice apartment in the middle of the plateau. The bed was a bit small, but the place was very nice and clean. I would definitely come back!",9.0

Ana is a very nice and accommodating host and a very sweet person.

"A very cute apartment located on street level in the heart of Plateau Mont Royal. The place was very clean and is a nice place to stay during a quick trip. The bathroom is great and everything is very close. 

Note that the bed is a futon, so it's better for one person than two! Also the kitchen is not equipped with items for cooking, so it's better if you are planning on eating out (which you should in Montreal).",9.0

Ana's place was clean, central, and nicely furnished.",9.0
"My accommodation is perfect for discovering Montreal. I was there on business trips, the proximity of public transport and restaurants was good, but it's quite bright (even at night) and because it's right next to the street, it was a little noisy.

Anastasia was very available and flexible, and responded quickly to my questions via text messages. An ideal host! The accommodation is very modern and I really enjoyed my stay.",9.0
"Anastasia's place was absolutely perfect for our trip to Montreal. The location in the Plateau could not have been better--just a block and a half from St. Denis and a short walk from Av. Mount-Royal. The studio is so thoughtfully set up and designed, and Ana's style is super fun and inspiring.  The futon bed was perfectly comfortable. And on a warm night the breeze from the window above the bed was great. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",9.0
A+ Location. Definitely staying here in the future,9.0
We loved Anastasia's stylish apartment in the gorgeous Plateau area and would have happily stayed there forever. Anastasia was extremely accommodating and very helpful throughout our stay. Thank you so much!,9.0
"The apartment was beautiful and in a great location! Anastasia was very friendly and answered all of my questions promptly. I really enjoyed my stay.

Just a heads up that, as other reviewers mentioned, the bed/futon is quite hard, although Anastasia has put a mattress pad down. It's fine for a short stay but you may want to consider bringing memory foam if you're staying longer.",9.0
"Studio perfectly located, quiet: in the heart of Mount Royal Plateau, which we loved and two minutes from the metro that takes you to Vieux Port.

The studio is comfortable, only a small drawback: the complete absence of blinds in front of the large bay windows very bright... nice during the day but sunrise guaranteed!",9.0
"Anastasia's place is in a superb location, close to the Metro and with many restaurants and cafes nearby. She is very responsive and accommodating as a host.",9.0
"Really cool little studio apartment in a fantastic location for accessing the Plateau and Mile End. Only a block away from the Metro. We found the futon to be very comfortable, but travelers looking for a proper bed might not. Would definitely stay here again.",9.0
"This place was cute and definitely an art studio. It's in a great part of the city! Anastasia said it might get a little loud at night due to the location, but we had no problems. Anastasia was very thorough with checkout procedures and helpful with any questions we had about the area. We thought the bed was very comfortable and had everything we needed. There is a nice radio that we used every day and kitchen items for cooking. Would recommend!",9.0
Anastasia's studio was bright and cozy. It is in an awesome location and close to lots of great bars and restaurants. I would stay here again next time I'm in Montreal. Thank you! :),9.0
It's basically okay.,9.0
"Full of character and centrally located, Ana was extremely responsive, which was particularly important as my flight was delayed. Thank you!",9.0
"Delightful apartment! The area it's located in overlooks the Plateau and, if desired, you can always stay in the neighborhood to eat or drink something. Anastasia, the reference person, was precise and available. If you have a car, you are practically 10 minutes away from anywhere indicated on a Lonely Planet guide to Montreal. I highly recommend it to everyone.",9.0
Great stay! The decor and level of cleanliness make it feel like a boutique hotel. Communication and coordination were very easy. Will definitely stay again :),9.0
Great place! Loved it! Will stay again!,9.0
"Wonderful little studio in a very convenient area - super close to the metro and lots of stores and restaurants nearby. The cleanliness, natural light, and decor make for a relaxing and inspiring atmosphere. It's street level so you often hear people or cars coming by, and there's light from the street lamps at night, but none of that stopped me from having the best sleep I've had in ages (that bed is really comfy!). Anastasia is a great host - very friendly and communicative, and I'd love to stay here again!",9.0
"Very cool open-plan apartment in a trendy neighborhood, with a comfy bed and within walking distance of restaurants and bars. The subway is a couple of blocks away. Check-in was super easy, I'd definitely stay here again.",9.0

"My stay at Anastasia's place was absolutely wonderful. I enjoyed the spacious studio which is very centrally located - a short walk to Mount Royal and a block from the very frequent Montreal subway. Anastasia was very responsive and helpful throughout, and I would definitely recommend friends to stay at her place as well.",9.0
"I had a lovely time at Anastasia's ultra-hip, yet comfortable apartment in the Plateau, one of Montreal's best neighborhoods. The space is beautiful with lots of natural light and is very spacious. So close to the Metro (a 3-minute walk) it was perfect for my short stay. Big beautiful windows let in lots of light, so bring a sleep mask if you're used to sleeping in total darkness. One of the best designed places I've stayed thus far - a pleasure to spend time in. Anastasia was very responsive and easily reachable. Want to feel like a real Montrealer? Stay at Anastasia's!",9.0
Anastasia's place was very fun and hip! It's in a great location and you can walk to almost anything. My friend and I had a great weekend stay.,9.0
"I had a great stay at Anastasia's lovely, bright, and open apartment. It's new, uber-clean, and tastefully decorated. The front windows are all opaque, so they may not be the best place for anyone who needs to sleep with blackout blinds (I personally really liked the light :) ). Would definitely recommend.",9.0
The studio was clean and in a fantastic location for exploring the restaurants and shops on the plateau. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay here again.,9.0

"The flat is very tastefully decorated, and is in an excellent location. Anastasia is flexible and communicates very, very clearly, promptly and fully. This made getting in and out very stress-free. Thank you and I would highly recommend your place in the future.",9.0
"This studio was exactly what I needed for a long weekend in Montreal. The space is clean and stylish while still being warm and hospitable. The large frosted street-level windows were lovely light and definitely added a cool factor.  I can see how large street-level windows might not be for everyone - but I really liked them. The proximity to the metro was very convenient, but not always necessary as there is so much to see and do within close walking distance of the apartment. 

Anastasia was very responsive and a great host.",9.0
"Excellent location for quick access to the metro and enjoying the cultural life of Plateau. I was amazed by the spacious and stylish design of this apartment. Perfect for a couple or solo traveler who needs a base. Only downside, the large windows that let in light from night lights and daytime light. In my case it didn't cause any problems but I know many travelers would have had their sleep disrupted by this detail.",9.0
Super apartment located in the heart of a vibrant neighborhood. The welcome and communication with Anastasia was perfect. Great choice!,9.0
Anatasia was fantastic and quick to respond to any questions I had!,9.0
Loved staying in Anastasia's studio! It was super cozy and perfect for a solo traveler like me. There was a small convenience store right at the corner and tons of shops and restaurants that are a short walking distance away. Communication was easy and I didn’t have any issues with parking on the street for the two days I was there! Would definitely recommend!,9.0

"Cool place! Stylish art studio, good size for 1-2 people. Host very easy to reach and accommodating, would stay again!",9.0
"Anastasia's place is an incredibly stylish and unique getaway located within walking distance of several great bars, restaurants, cafes, and stores. The space is open and welcoming with large opaque windows and plenty of natural light. Anastasia is easy to reach and responds very quickly if you have any questions or need recommendations. While it gets freezing outside, the place stays nice and warm throughout each room, which was a big plus for us, non-Montreal natives. There are plenty of kitchen supplies and utensils, but they can be hard to find as the home has a very ""lived-in"" feel and layout. Also, there is no TV, which wasn't an issue, but it should be mentioned (luckily there was a speaker with an aux to play some music). The shower can be a little tricky to get the right temperature and the shower door doesn't close fully (I wasn't kidding when I said the space is ""open""). But, all of these minor details aside, this space is unlike any other Airbnb or hotel you could find and it is absolutely worth staying in.",9.0
"Cute, quiet space close to amenities and the metro.",9.0
Anastasia was very sweet and kind! Her place was very clean and it was at a very convenient location!,9.0
"Great location, close to many amenities and very clean! It was a great place to stay for the weekend.",9.0
"Anastasia's studio is ideally located on the plateau, a 3-minute walk from Mont-Royal metro station and all shops. The decor is stylish and very nice. It is very clean, well equipped, very bright (don't forget your mask to sleep as there are no curtains or blinds), very pleasant, ideal for 1 or 2 people. Anastasia is a very pleasant host, very responsive and very accommodating. She always finds a solution. I will definitely return to it during my next stay in Montreal and I highly recommend it.",9.0
Very cute place to stay in Montreal,9.0
"Anastasia's studio was an absolute pleasure to stay in. The neighborhood was an excellent central location in Le Plateau, with tons of retail shops, cafes, bars and restaurants to explore. The apartment was immaculate, and the bed much more comfortable than expected!

Anastasia was extremely communicative, providing quick and clear instructions for entry and check-out. I will be sure to see if this studio is available if I ever find myself back in Montreal!",9.0
"Anastasia's studio was perfect for our stay in Montreal. Only a short walk from the Mont-Royal subway stop, which takes you right downtown, the studio is conveniently located in the Plateau, with short walks to some of the city's best neighborhoods and streets, like Mile End, Laurier-Est and Boul St Laurent. Anastasia was quick to communicate with us, and we appreciated her flexible check-out times which worked so well with our flights. Just a note to future guests that the bed is a futon with a mattress pad, which we weren't expecting. It was a little small for my boyfriend and I and one side had a bit of a bump where the futon folded down which wasn't particularly comfortable to sleep on. That, and the fact that there were no coverings on the large windows (as indicated in the photos) would make it a little difficult for a sensitive sleeper, so I would recommend bringing a sleeping mask if the light at night bothers you as this is an open concept space and everything (aside from the bathroom, which was great) is in one space. That was the one thing that was a little misleading about the studio, but otherwise, it was a great space to chill out in after adventuring around the city all day. Thanks for having us Anastasia!",9.0
Great location - Easy check-in/check-out - Good communication,9.0
Fantastic place in a great location! Easy access to the metro and just about everything else in Montreal.,9.0

"The apartment is great and in an amazing location. The only ""problem"" was that the bed was a futon, so it wasn't as comfortable. However, if you like to sleep in very dark rooms, this might not be the place for you as it doesn't have curtains. That didn't bother me at all. Anastasia was very nice, accommodating, and responsive. I would definitely stay there again.",9.0

"A nice, street-level studio apartment that is well-maintained and in a great location to walk to St. Denis, parks, and more! Nice, double-lock entryway right on the street. 

Note: This home is *genuine* Airbnb! Some Airbnb properties are permanent investments--the owner rents their property full time. This is not the case here-- Anastasia's home is clearly a part-time art studio and home, which makes it personal. The home is astonishingly clean and well maintained! But tourists who expect a sterile, empty hotel-room experience should look elsewhere. Also note that window treatments do not allow you to ""black-out"" the space, so if you need total dark to sleep you should look elsewhere. 

Otherwise, come and enjoy a classy, stylish little home! Great, instant communication from the host. Wonderful Indian restaurant and playground one block south. Easy walk to Chocolates de Chloe, Fruiterie  Plateau, Mamie Clafoutis, Park La Fontaine, and other Montreal favorites. Go get hibiscus ice cream at Cremerie Meu Meu! Very close to Mont-Royal metro stop for a quick ride to Old Port, Museums, etc.",9.0

"I stayed at Anastasia's lovely art studio for two nights while visiting friends. The location is BRILLIANT: so close to the metro, and so many great places to eat and drink. The apartment, as expected, is a studio space on the ground floor with frosted glass rather than curtains. Everything is beautifully done but, as other reviewers suggest, an eye mask is definitely recommended!",9.0
Unique studio in the heart of a cool neighborhood. Anastasia was a great communicator/host and I truly enjoyed my stay. Would book again.,9.0
"Anastasia's place was the absolute best choice we could have made for a place to stay in Montreal! It was spotless, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed and more!

We truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely choose to stay here next time!",9.0
Anastasia is a very good host. Communication was easy.,9.0
"Super location in one of Montreal's most beautiful neighborhoods. The loft is equipped with basic amenities but very stylish. The futon bed is best for one person. I would go back if I was on vacation, but not for business travel. The street can be quite noisy at times due to tourists walking by.",9.0
"Great flat in a great location (very close to Subway station Mont Royal). Anastasia was nice, precise and very helpful. The only (very small) negative point was that there are no curtains on the big windows, so bring your sleeping mask. Other than that, perfect! Would recommend 100% to anyone visiting Montreal.",9.0
"This is a very ""hip"" studio in a very trendy part of town. It is spacious and very clean. Like other reviewers, the street noise (voices, cars, late night revellers) are very loud, so it might not be the place for you if you aren’t a sound sleeper.  The big windows also let in lots of light, so a sleep mask or an early start might be necessary. We also had a difficult time finding parking (came in on a Friday). The street signs were confusing (in French), but once we found one it was free and good for the whole weekend!! It’s a very lovely spot, but depending on your needs and lifestyle (e.g., you're an old insomniac like me), it might not be a great fit.",9.0
We recommend this studio for its location and new condition. Anastasia is truly very available and responsive. We had a fantastic stay in this studio.,9.0
"Anastasia has a beautiful apartment! It is very comfortable, clean, and perfectly located. Moreover, she was very attentive and responded quickly to my questions and requests. I highly recommend this apartment without any doubt!",9.0
"A very stylish place located in a great neighborhood with great restaurants and shops, all within walking distance from Mont Royal, the old center, and Mile End, another lively neighborhood. Anastasia was very responsive and helpful. If one thing I would say the bed wasn't the most comfortable bed I slept on. Other than that, it was a great place to stay for a long weekend in Montreal.",9.0
"I really enjoyed staying at Anastasia's place. The place was just as pictured and the location is also great for commuting. The place was perfect for me while I could rest and enjoy the city of Montreal. However, it wouldn't be ideal if you are a light sleeper.",9.0
There is some noise nearby that is not conducive to rest.,9.0
"Great location in Montreal, very intimate yet centrally located within the surrounding neighborhoods teeming with life. The stylish interior design also creates a relaxing atmosphere.",9.0
"Anastasia's place could not be in a more perfect location - only about 2 blocks to the metro, in the heart of the plateau's best restaurants. Parking in the area is really tough (outside of Sat & Sun where there is limited street parking in front of the apartment). The apartment was clean and bright and spacious for a studio. Thanks for the great stay! We would stay again next time we are in town!",9.0
Anastasia was very gracious in letting me arrive early. I really love this neighborhood and this studio is a great base to explore from.,9.0
"This was a great place to stay in Montreal, and loved the location as it was easily accessible to the Metro (which takes you to the airport and downtown), close walking distance to St. Denis/awesome coffee shops and shopping, and a very sweet place. Looks exactly as listed in the pictures. I am a light sleeper, but in general had no issues with sleeping as some previous reviews have suggested (there is a fan to help with background noise).

"Clean modern work studio in a great location. The bed is also a folding sofa, but fine. There aren't really any places to lounge other than on the bed, but the space itself is quite comfortable. As others have mentioned, the space can't be made totally dark, but we didn't find that to be an issue. Very convenient location, near Metro.",9.0
"Staying at Anastasia's place makes it different. Great host and great location, 100% recommended to every person visiting Montreal!",9.0

Wonderful stay in this very nice apartment on Mount Royal Plateau. I recommend it.,9.0
"This space was very clean and in a good part of the city. There were very minimal amenities - no tea, coffee, dishes in any of the cupboards (all were left in the dishwasher). We also found it got quite cold and the heating takes a while to kick in. The space is beautiful, check-in was easy, and Anastasia was a good communicator. This place really is a studio and not really designed well to accommodate sleepers. The bed is a somewhat comfortable futon and there is a tonne of light at night through the wall of windows facing a semi-busy street. If the futon was a more comfortable pull-out couch and there were curtains over the windows, this would be a great Airbnb. It suited me fine for 2 nights but I was happy to return to a real bed!",9.0
This location is absolutely wonderful! It is next to a number of boutique shops and the food around there is great. Getting around town is very easy because the location is a 3 minute walk from the metro. Anastasia's place is extraordinarily clean and the studio is decorated very well. Super great value!,9.0
"Anastasia's place is very nice and centrally located. However, a couple of details could be improved: we found the bed to be a little too small for two, and not extremely comfortable. Also, the heating made a noise that was distracting, especially at night when trying to sleep. Perhaps adding some blinds to make it darker for sleeping would also be helpful? Other than that, great place!",9.0

"William was very available, even though he couldn't be present on the day we arrived, he left us everything we needed. The apartment is very functional and very nice. It is very well located, a few minutes from the metro and shops. Ideal for a stay in Montreal! Thank you for everything, William!",10.0
"William was an excellent host throughout the entire experience. He greeted us upon arrival and was easy to contact during our stay. He provided us with some information on public transportation, a list of his favorite spots, and even some great music! The apartment is simple, neat, and clean with plenty of amenities. It's located in a quintessential Montreal neighborhood with manageable parking around the corner. Be sure not to park right in front (Hutchinson), as it's resident-only and we got a parking ticket within 20 minutes because it's permit-parking only. Around the corner, there is pay-by-space parking and some other free spots. We used Uber and our car to get around, but the metro is close and seems very manageable. William is a great resource for anything you may need to know about the area.",10.0

"We had a great experience at William's place. His apartment is steps from a centrally located subway stop (and grocery store - bonus!), yet very quiet and safe. I am a light sleeper and was surprised at how quiet it was (Email hidden by Airbnb) communication was great from the moment I tried to book. There was a glitch on Airbnb's side and William worked with them to correct the problem within a few hours.  I never had to wait long for a response to any of my questions.  I even had a few over the holidays while he was traveling, and he replied quickly! If you're looking for a well-located, tidy, cozy apartment with a comfy bed, stocked kitchen and plenty of room for two, this is your place. I plan to visit Montreal again soon (I hope!) and I would not seek a different spot to stay unless I had to!",10.0

"Excellent location, next to Notre Dame and the old Montreal. In front of the Palais de Congress. For cold days there is quick access to the RESO that takes you to the Desjardins Center where there's a market. We were as a couple with a baby. The apartment was super equipped. We only missed a sofa for the end of the day.",9.0
"A simple way to get the keys at the welcome desk near the apartment. Alejandro was quick to respond if we had questions. Parking was possible on-site for a reasonable price. The apartment was really clean and bright and had everything from pots to cutting boards... The location is perfect for visiting Old Montreal.

Unfortunately, the bed was a bit hard and shaky; if someone turned around, you could hear the fridge and air conditioning during nighttime. 

Despite these two things, we really enjoyed our stay in Montreal.",9.0
Loved the place and its location. Very close to everything.,9.0
"This place made our stay in Montreal beyond perfect. What a perfect location and such a great experience.

"Great apartment/suite in a perfect location on the edge of Old Montreal, within walking distance to both downtown, Notre Dame, and all other sights in Old Montreal. There was a Metro stop literally 2-3 minutes away, which was convenient for getting nearly anywhere else in the city. 

The apartment itself was clean, spacious, and comfortable. It looked and felt like a hotel suite (was even in the Embassy Suites building, I believe). 18th floor with a nice view of Mont Royal (could see the cross out of our window). Gym on site and onsite underground parking available (though at an additional charge of $30/day). Laundry in the apartment was an added benefit. 

Alejandro was responsive leading up to the trip and very friendly. It was a bit harder to reach him during our stay, but he works with a company (Corporate Stays) that was reachable during their business hours, and Corporate Stays was able to assist with any of our questions/concerns.

Though the apartment is a bit pricey, I thought the location was excellent and the space was comfortable. Thanks Alejandro and Corporate Stays!",9.0
"Stayed there for a month, perfect location in Old Montreal, close to everything you need, especially the metro station. The place had an hotel feel to it and the view was great (I was on the 20th floor). I had some issues with the WiFi but they gave me a number to call for customer service and the issue was quickly fixed.",9.0
"Managed by a corporate rental company. Key pickup is at another location 7 minutes walk away. They require photo ID for keys. The building is primarily short-term rentals. A 2-minute walk to Notre Dame and the Metro. Great location. The unit was clean. The front door was off its hinges, making it difficult to open and close. Kitchen cabinet hinges were also broken. The bathtub turns into a swimming pool after 2 minutes. No microwave. Wifi did not work. The layout is like a 600 sq ft condo. Great space. Clean appliances, good cable package. King-sized bed. Lots of pillows, very quiet at night. Location, location, location! I would go back and hope the bathtub was unclogged. :)",9.0

"I was really happy with the rental. The apartment was clean and modern, and looked just like the photos. The kitchen is fantastic, and there's also a BBQ outside. This would be a great rental for a couple who enjoy grabbing food from local markets and preparing meals. The apartment is located on a one-way laneway with little to no traffic. The apartment is a 3-5 minute walk away from the gay village. There's an amazing brunch place called Le Passe Compose just steps away from the apartment that I highly recommend guests check out.",10.0
"Richard greeted us warmly, offering a few cold drinks from the fridge! The pictures accurately depicted the house's current interior and exterior - beautiful! Unfortunately, the cleanliness of the house was not as good as I had anticipated, considering the cleaning fees paid.  I had to wash the inside of the refrigerator, kitchen counters, and bathroom, and the upstairs floors. The main floor was also dirty, but we kept our shoes on during our stay. We were disappointed there was no air conditioning and only two windows had screens to let in cool air at night. The patio doors did not have screen doors either. We recommend installing a ceiling fan above the bed; however, there were two small fans that came with the unit which we used. The neighborhood itself was sketchy - we witnessed homeless people changing clothes and a drug user shooting up in the parkette across from the house. Despite the negatives, the house is completely modern and beautiful inside - you would never know it was originally built in the 1800s! Richard used wood from the old house for the new renovations that add wonderful charm to the updated kitchen and living room. The kitchen was a dream to cook and eat in and had everything we needed (except a microwave, but not crucial). The bathroom was huge and we especially loved the large luxurious spa shower. The area was surprisingly very quiet so we had no trouble sleeping. Perhaps the characters in the park were outliers. You would be hard-pressed to find such a spacious, modern, and beautiful home with a covered deck and lovely backyard in the middle of the city.",10.0

Overall, we loved our stay and would absolutely rebook for our next visit to Montreal.",10.0
"We had such a wonderful experience from start to finish. Richard and his family are lovely hosts who genuinely made us feel welcomed. You cannot beat the location. There are 2 metro stations within 5 minutes walking distance. Located in the village, there is a thriving nightlife and restaurant scene 2 blocks away. The home itself is clean, modern, yet cozy all at the same time. We loved the backyard area and the small park just steps from the front door. It's so nice to have outdoor space on vacation! I would, without hesitation, recommend this place. This was our first Airbnb experience, and it exceeded our expectations. Richard is so kind and accommodating and the condo itself was the perfect spot. I'm so glad we did this and we would stay here again in a second.",10.0
"Richard was fantastic! We arrived a little early but he was able to take our bags and recommend a little coffee shop for us to go to while he just finished up cleaning inside!

I arrived during a heatwave in Montreal and the place had no AC upon my arrival, but within an hour Richard went and got an AC unit! Incredible. Highly recommended; you won't find a better place.",10.0
"The house is superb, the little garden a corner of paradise!
The bed is very comfortable, we had a very good night.
Richard was very welcoming, we had two beers waiting for us in the fridge: super attention!
Small downside: the neighborhood. We stayed only one night and maybe it was exceptional but the street wasn't very quiet.
Recommended!",10.0
"Richard was very welcoming and responded quickly to any communication I had. The house was comfortable, clean, and cozy. The location was very convenient; the house is one block from the closest metro station (Beaudry) which is one station from a main transit hub (Berri-UQAM). This allows for easy access to many parts of the city. Also, within two blocks, there is a grocery store that has a mixture of fresh food/produce and was more than enough to keep us well stocked during our stay. Definitely would come back during future visits to Montreal.",10.0
"Richard's apartment is a fantastic place to stay when visiting Montreal, we had so much fun! The location is perfect, very close to the Metro, as well as many shops, restaurants and bars. It is set back from the main street so the avenue is quiet. We were able to find free street parking nearby, and then we walked everywhere. 

The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Richard provided everything we could need, the washer & dryer were a nice bonus. It is also nice to have a private backyard for relaxing, especially in the beautiful summer weather. 

Richard was quick to communicate and very flexible. Our arrival time was pushed back and he made it easy to contact him and check into the apartment. 

If you are looking for accommodations in Le Village, Richard's apartment is a great choice!",10.0

The accommodation is very well located in Montreal, for a first visit to the city it's a good starting point. 
The accommodation corresponds exactly to the photos, functional and well equipped. 
It offers a good value for money considering the apartment's amenities. 

I recommend this accommodation to people who, like me, do not know Montreal and want to discover this city.",10.0
"I can highly recommend this stay. Everything about the house is exceptional. Brand new kitchen, bathroom, living space, beautiful backyard.  Plus, it's located on one of the nicest streets in the heart of a metropolitan city like Montreal. We actually cancelled other plans we had and spent the night here so we could enjoy the space. Marie greeted us warmly, like family, and helped us learn the ins and outs of the house. Can't wait to return again.",10.0
"We had a wonderful time at Richard's house! He is a great host and was very responsive throughout the process. His wife was there to welcome us and show us the house and the neighborhood for the best place to park. 

The location is great, there are stores nearby but it's set off the main street and very quiet, we especially enjoyed the backyard with the covered deck. The house was very clean and modern, exactly like the photos, the bathroom was very roomy with a luxurious spa shower. Richard and his wife were very welcoming and attentive and made us feel at home, I would definitely stay there again and highly recommend!",10.0

Richard and Melanie were very friendly and welcoming. The apartment was perfect for my stay.,10.0
"This apartment is impeccable and decorated with care and attention. The location is charming in an unusual street and allows for very quick access to the city center as well.

As Richard had indicated, at the end of the evening, upon reintegrating the apartment, I was able to easily find a parking spot in the surrounding streets.

A longer stay would have allowed me to fully enjoy the amenities and attractions of this apartment. When I return to Montreal, I will search for Richard's apartment whose value for money is excellent. Note that Richard's Superhost status played a role in my decision to choose his apartment.

The place is great. Super clean, quiet, great shower and all top-of-the-line appliances. It's also near a lot of nice shops and eateries.

"A great place to stay right in the heart of the Village ~ just steps away from the Metra station, restaurants and shops. Richard was wonderful ~ he was there to greet us upon arrival and showed us around the house.

The decor is amazing and it's a very cozy place.

It's definitely a perfect getaway, and we will be back for spring hopefully!",10.0
"Richard's place is fantastic! I can't recommend this unique home enough. My boyfriend and I stayed here during a trip to Montreal and our only wish was that we had more time to spend. The location is fantastic (in the heart of the city), the home is beautiful, and you can really tell Richard cares about the little details, even the sheets in the bed were super soft and comfy. Above all, Richard gave us suggestions and even told us about the fantastic story of the historic home that he's remodeled into a truly gorgeous place. This has been one of our best, if not the best, Airbnb experiences we've had.",10.0

Richard is a very friendly and welcoming host. The house we rented from him is a real haven of tranquility in the heart of Montreal. We loved it.,10.0
"Richard was at the house doing some maintenance work when I arrived and was very friendly. The photos accurately represent the house. The kitchen is nice and spacious, though it could use a few more cooking utensils.

The location is nice and located on a very private side street/alleyway with one of the city's many tiny public parks across the street (think a few trees and a couple of benches). There will be virtually zero traffic outside your door. There are (French) guide books in the house that can point you in the right direction, if you're looking for something to do.

I stayed at Richard's place in February, and the heated concrete on the first floor was great. I would love to come back in the spring or summer and enjoy the quiet backyard, which would be perfect for a romantic picnic.

Overall, a great stay and I'd definitely recommend it.",10.0

Also, had brunch at Passé Compose just down the street, and highly recommend it - just get there with plenty of time, the line was out the door!

"This place has an amazing location and yard! It is located on the cutest street in Montreal, right out of Paris. Parking wasn't too hard to find nearby even with many local roads closed when we were there. The backyard is definitely the highlight of this place! The whole apartment looks just like the pictures. 

The kitchen could use a few more items; if you plan on cooking you might want to bring a few of your own things including a knife (the one that was there wasn't great). If you come in the summer, and have room, bringing a fan wouldn't hurt. There is AC but just in the upstairs bedroom.

Richard (the host) is a really cool guy, hopefully you get a chance to chat with him when you stay. We had an awesome time and would definitely stay here again.",10.0
"Richards' Airbnb is located in a central spot. It was a 5-10 minute walk to transit, food, nightlife, etc. It offered plenty of space and had everything we needed - there was an iron, lots of closet space, hair dryer, washer/dryer onsite, AC, etc. There was also plenty of free street parking available. His location is on a small side street so you'll need to park a short distance away. Richard was responsive and check-in was a breeze!",10.0
We had a pleasant stay. The apartment was clean and the little garden ideal for enjoying the nice weather.,10.0

"Richard's place is such a gem that I'm reluctant to share. It's exactly the kind of place I'd like to come home to every day. It's perfectly minimalist, with everything you need. It made me consider moving to Montreal.

The backyard is a real treat after a long day traipsing around the city (or a long drive from NYC) and there's a small park across from the front door. Ample, but competitive, parking on the streets. The shower has three heads and a detachable head. Don't say I didn't warn you.

The bed was so comfortable that we overslept and were late getting back to New York. My only regret was not bringing my laundry. I had a lot of fun playing with the kitchen lights, too.",10.0

"It's very quiet and peaceful. It takes about 20-30 minutes to walk to downtown. We walked around the neighborhood while we were there, exploring it. The city hall is close by, as well as VIA Rail, and Notre Dame Cathedral is also nearby. And the house was so clean that I was surprised and felt comfortable. I stayed for just five days, but it was really great! (Mom loved it^^)",10.0
"We loved Richard's place and found it much better than expected. The pictures do not do it justice. 
Parking was relatively easy on R. Panet, and we always found by Parc Raymond Blain. The location to the Gay Village is perfect being close enough to the bars and restaurants. The property is on a quiet street with no regular vehicular traffic.
We couldn't enjoy the backyard, but believe it would have been wonderful during the summer. The kitchen is stocked with essential sundries. 
We both left Montreal being in love with the city, and would definitely consider staying at Richard's place again.",10.0

It's far from the hustle and bustle of St Catherine but close enough that you can be in the lively neighborhood in under 5 minutes. The space is spacious, welcoming, and just lovely. If you're not a city person, don't try to brave a car rental unless absolutely necessary. Parking was tough to find at night. Besides this, it was the perfect getaway and the best place to stay!",10.0

"This comfortable, clean apartment is on a quiet one-way street with lots of character. It's a peaceful little neighborhood but at the same time only a short walk to Saint Catherine Street, about a block away. 

The queen bed was comfortable with cozy bedding and plenty of pillows. The place can accommodate a family, but everyone has to sleep in the loft together. The loft itself is spacious, with a bathroom, an outdoor deck, and air conditioning. The first floor has an open living room and large kitchen with a porch and small yard surrounded by a tall privacy fence. So although the apartment is not huge, it has many spaces within its boundaries. Very comfortable. 

Richard himself was always quick to respond to our every need. He reached out to us through Airbnb while we were on our way there to ensure a smooth self-check-in and answered promptly each time we had a question. Also, I inadvertently left behind some valuables and he agreed to send them to me promptly through the mail. 

I highly recommend this place.",10.0
"Excellent location just blocks from all the action in the Gay Village, and short walks to other major points of interest. It's in a quiet alley tucked away across from a small park and boasts a lovely green yard and balcony to enjoy the sunshine and watch the birds and trees mingle.

Upstairs, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom is clean and stylish, and as an added bonus you have a solid washer and dryer that came in (Email hidden by Airbnb). Communication between Richard and I was very smooth and clear. I will definitely stay here again!",10.0

"We had a fantastic week in Valérie and Jean's apartment. We immediately felt like we were at home in this super cozy, perfectly clean apartment with everything we need and more for both short and long stays. We will definitely go back without hesitation for even just a minute. The Hochelaga neighborhood is really nice and lively and perfect for exploring the city. Finally, Valérie and Jean are very warm and truly care that our stay is perfect.",10.0
"My daughter and I had an excellent 3-night stay at Valerie’s apartment! It was exactly what we were looking for as we had tickets to an event at the arena within Olympic Park and wanted accommodation within walking distance. One of the reasons we enjoy using Airbnb is to get to know local neighborhoods of big cities, such as Montreal's Maisonneuve. The apartment actually exceeded our expectations - it is as pictured and described; very well stocked with what we needed for a comfortable stay; we parked our car right in front and either walked or used public transport to get wherever we needed to go (Olympic Park – Biodome and Planetarium a short walk – and we took the Metro into the Montreal Old Town); appreciated the maps, tourist info and book with Valerie's personal recommendations of nearby restaurants, services, etc. including the nearby Maisonneuve Market. After our busy days, it was great to come “home” to our classic “Montreal walk-up” apartment! Merci Jean and Valerie!",10.0
"This was my first Airbnb experience and what an amazing one it was! Valerie and Jean were fantastic hosts. The apartment itself was cozy, comfortable, very clean, and had everything we needed. A cute balcony which made me feel so relaxed and like I was away somewhere tropical. The apartment's location is also great. Great restaurants nearby, convenience stores, a market, the metro, and other cool places to check out in Montreal like Parc Île Jean Drapeau were a 15-minute drive. Would give this 5 out of 5 rating and highly recommend it to others!",10.0
"My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay with Valerie and Jean. They were very accommodating to our early arrival time. The place was clean and comfortable to come back to after spending the days exploring the city. Montreal was great to visit. Also, one day we were able to rent a car and drive up to Quebec City. It was a couple hours drive, but it was well worth it. We also enjoyed checking out the nearby planetarium, botanical gardens, market, and Hoche Cafe.",10.0

"Both Naveen and I were very impressed with the apartment. Everything was neat and clean. The kitchen is well equipped. The pictures are very accurate. We would have enjoyed staying longer.  The location is perfect. It is very close to the Botanical Garden (easy walking distance). The Metro is located at the Garden as well, so getting downtown was very easy. We parked our car and used public transportation the whole weekend. Ontario Street is a great place to check out (again, easy walking distance). Valerie was wonderful. We really appreciate all the extra touches she adds (books to read, maps of the city, guest book with details about nearby stores/restaurants).",10.0

It's obvious that Jean and Valerie care and want you to have a pleasant experience. The market just a couple of blocks away is amazing. We really enjoyed buying some things for dinner and eating outside on the balcony. The subway is a short walk away, which makes traveling into the city very easy.  The neighborhood itself is quiet and friendly, and it's perfect if you are traveling by car since you can park right outside.",10.0

"My husband and I had a perfect weekend here for our second wedding anniversary. This apartment was quiet, clean, and romantic. Valerie and Jean are very kind hosts, and even better, they gave us more time to leave the apartment because of our later train departure. I love Montreal, I know I'll be back, and next time, for longer! Thank you all, Jean and Valérie, for a real Montreal experience.",10.0
"A beautiful place to stay, just outside of old Montreal. The subway was a 5-10 minute walk away and easy to find. It was another 5-10 minute ride into town, but it was great to get off at different stations and have a look around. Car parking was easy and we felt comfortable leaving the car out front.  The unit itself was clean and comfortable; the bed was so cozy. The only minor criticism, there was no aircon, but there are multiple fans which helps cool the unit down. Overall a great place to stay and I would recommend the unit to anyone wanting to visit Montreal. Thanks Valérie for being a great host.",10.0

"I cannot recommend Valerie and Jean strongly enough; they were the perfect hosts. When my friend and I had travel issues/delays, Valerie was always very quick to reply to my updated messages regarding our changing schedule.  The apartment is perfect: very clean, cozy, with a small private balcony, a comfy bed... really an ideal base from which to explore Montreal. Although it's north of the city center, there are lots of things to do/explore within walking distance of the apartment including the old Olympic Park and Botanical Gardens, plus, the Metro is about a 10-minute walk so it's very easy to get anywhere else in the city. This is an ideal, quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of downtown that still allows visitors to take advantage of all Montreal has to offer.",10.0
"Valerie and Jean are absolutely charming hosts, generous and very accommodating. They gave us excellent advice for organizing our stay in Quebec.

The apartment was just as described, wonderfully clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Plenty of power outlets to charge my many camera batteries as well. While we didn't use it, I loved that the kitchen was well supplied with all the pots and pans you might need to cook yourself a nice dinner to eat on their lovely back porch. It's located within walking distance of many outstanding restaurants, Olympic Park, and the Metro for easy access to downtown Montreal. Easy parking on the street right outside as well!

Ontario and St Catherine streets have charm with their diverse shops; the bakery, butcher shop, and beer store, various bars/cafes, and the beautiful covered market of Maisonneuve. We had a wonderful weekend where snow fell in big flakes, making the street with all these stairs and trees, magnificent. 
Valérie and Jean have a welcoming spirit that is pleasant to experience with this type of rental, and we say, gladly, as we leave, that we will be happy to come back and see them again!!",10.0

He responded promptly each time we contacted him. Also, he offered to act as a concierge if needed during our trip. The building is safe and secure, and the quiet neighbors will allow for a relaxing sleep in a large and comfortable bed. It was obvious the apartment had just been cleaned, and the linens were freshly washed. The Wi-Fi was fast and dependable, and there was Netflix and Apple TV.

Ka was extremely helpful and flexible with our check-in and check-out which I greatly appreciated since I was coming from the United States and was caught in border traffic. The building is extremely safe. Only thing to keep in mind is that currently your car must be 6'3 or shorter to fit in the garage. We found parking on the street since it was the weekend and had no issue.",9.0

"Everything about this apartment worked well for us. The host was friendly and helpful, going out of his way to drop off a second key and let us store our luggage on our last day. The location was perfect for my conference a couple of blocks away. We loved the balcony and the TV setup. The bed was very firm – best if you like that in a bed. The only downside – a previous guest had left something in the fridge that had gone bad and left a pretty unpleasant odor – was easy to deal with.",9.0
"We were extremely happy with this booking, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this apartment. The host, Karim, is a delightful young man who is hospitable, respectful and very capable—thus, a great host.

We stayed here with two elderly people, and their comfort was of utmost importance to us. We therefore had a lot of questions prior to booking the apartment and before our arrival. Karim was prompt in his replies and diligent in his answers. Everything went smoothly and according to plan. 

The apartment was clean and in tip-top shape when we checked in. One thing we loved was the bathroom, which was very spacious—offering not only a bathtub, but also a shower. The kitchen was clean and aptly equipped, which was nice. Nice big couches as well! Being a high-rise building, the view was also great. This is a relatively small apartment, however it does not feel like it at all. The people who work at this apartment building—those at the reception etc.—are also very helpful and able persons. They assisted us whenever we needed help, which would have probably happened even if Karim did not also talk to them on our behalf upon our arrival. 

However, the biggest asset of this property is probably its location. It is situated in the heart of downtown Montreal. If your desire is to do all the touristy things Montreal has to offer especially in the summer, this apartment is ideally situated. For instance, the Canada Day Parade took place only a street away (5 mins walk) the day after we arrived (July 1). A couple of days later, a cycling race happened right in front of the building, which was a lot of fun to watch. Quartier des spectacles, where the Jazz Festival was happening, is only a couple of metro stops away. The Old Port/Old Town is about a 10 min taxi/car ride.

This location should also prove ideal for families from outside Montreal who wish to visit the numerous universities in Montreal. Both Concordia* and McGill are at a walking distance, and UQAM is again only several metro/bus stops away. This may also apply to scholars. (*Not Loyola Campus, but the downtown campus)

In all, we were extremely happy with our stay. Great host, great apartment, great location, and a most wonderful city.

"I don't do negative reviews, but this is not a video, pic, or opinion. This was technically a transaction between two parties (three?). I will stick to the facts and you can draw your own conclusions.

I booked my first trip using Airbnb on October 15th (credit card record). Since it was my first time, I emailed with some questions but didn't hear back. I wasn't alarmed since it seemed to be a hosting business posting through this website.

On November 18th, three days before my trip, I emailed a second time. The host never replied. On Tuesday, November 20th at noon, my spouse was able to talk on the phone (we weren't sure about bringing linens, parking, and/or how we would get the key). Everything looked fine; he will be waiting for us, be sure to text 30 minutes before arriving.

Since we were planning on leaving at 5 am, I went to bed early. At 11:33 pm, I got a text message that didn't make sense... checked my email and there was a message about a heating issue and that ""...I unfortunately won't be able to get the heating system back in operation before your arrival. Please accept my apologies."" I wasn't sure how to proceed; would I get the apartment later in the afternoon? What did it mean? I went back to bed thinking I needed to get up earlier; I would check my email later and hoping for good news.

At 1:13 am, I got a second text saying my reservation had been canceled. Now I was suddenly awake. In a couple of hours, I needed to wake up my family for a seven-hour drive to a metropolitan city where we didn't have a place to sleep?!

By now, I have three emails from Airbnb in my inbox... at 1:13 am with the cancellation; 1:28 am with a ticket number; and 1:37 am with a manager following up.

One of the emails has a button to get a refund or a button to rebook.

I booked a hotel using a well-known travel website, once I got my confirmation, I requested a refund (which now shows on my credit card from November 22nd).

So, as far as my experience was, I won't be using or recommending Airbnb. Maybe it was an isolated case, maybe the heating was really broken; I don't want to hurt anyone's business, but something didn't add up. As a consumer, I felt completely vulnerable. 

By the way: I don't know how much information Airbnb shared with the hosts, but to be able to book you need to upload your driver's license and/or passport, a recent picture, and I might be forgetting something... I spent hours preparing this trip that almost didn't happen, but maybe because I knew the destination pretty well, I was able to fix it quickly.

What I'm not so sure of fixing quickly is removing my personal data from Airbnb.",9.0
"After a problem with the apartment I had rented, we were given another apartment slightly smaller but more luxurious. Modern amenities, very clean, well-located with a garage; excellent for a stay in Montreal.

I did not meet Kams, it was his friend Rubens who welcomed us. Check-in imposed at 6:30 PM which I managed to negotiate to 5:45 PM. It's a bit late especially since check-out is at 12:00 PM. He didn't seem to know much about our arrival. Communication with Kams via email was slow at first but very responsive later on, to clarify certain points regarding the apartment change.

Excellent apartment, well located, good value for money. Highly recommended without hesitation.",9.0

"We were traveling as a family of three and had booked this large apartment with a jacuzzi to enjoy the end of our Canadian trip.

It all started with a scavenger hunt to find the host's collaborator in a neighborhood where parking was impossible within a stone's throw, requiring about 10 phone calls.

At that point, he claimed there was an electrical problem in the apartment and redirected us to another apartment and a street parking spot with a payment card for purchasing tickets.

In the end, this apartment only had a double bed and no jacuzzi.

He offered us a inflatable mattress: unique for a luxurious apartment!

We naturally refused and he promised us a refund.

We had to find an emergency solution to find accommodation at 7pm because he hadn't taken the trouble to inform us of the unavailability before check-in.

After three days, still no refund.

I had to contact AirBnb to cancel the reservation and initiate the refund.

In short, a host who doesn't communicate, doesn't manage much.
Not serious, absolutely avoid!",9.0

"Although this host helped Airbnb and I out of a difficult situation by being available last minute, this unit was not what was pictured or described at all. It felt like we got a bait and switch unit. And, because apparently AirBnB's are not allowed in the building, we were escorted to the back door/parking garage by hosts and asked to keep a low profile. The unit looked like it had no longer been cared for.  Old furniture, a broken mirror in the bedroom, all the pictures were crooked. It looked like a college student lived there. It was not at all what was advertised or pictured. It was terribly disappointing.",9.0
"The host canceled our stay the morning of our flight arrival in Montreal!!! We booked 2 months in advance the same apartment with the same host we did 8 months ago. We received the usual Airbnb message of our incoming trip 7 days prior to our stay. I sent a message to the host two days before as I did not receive any information on where and how to meet and get the key. I resent a message 18 hours before and just before taking our flight to Montreal. No answer!

We landed in Montreal and I received from Airbnb an email, a SMS and a phone message saying that the host canceled our stay. We had to find a hotel and of course at peak tourist season and higher prices. This is not an individual who rents his apartment but some kind of company. Very unprofessional and untrustworthy.",9.0

"To simplify things: what you see is what you get. :) Though we had to switch apartments briefly due to water damage, it met our expectations exactly. Karim's apartments seem to all be of the same modern style. Nice lounge area, two TVs, a modern bathroom, a comfortable bed, and a well-equipped kitchen. Above all, there's free parking in the garage and an outdoor heated pool. A really amazing extra was the free coffee service in the lobby from Monday to Friday that we enjoyed very much.

Our apartment was - as promised - right in the heart of Downtown and also just a few steps away from ""Crescent Street"" with all its bars, pubs, and restaurants.
Before our visit I was a little concerned if the central location might cause too much noise but in the end we heard nothing. No noise from the streets or any neighbors. 

The only small thing missing was a hair dryer (or maybe we just didn't find it...?) However, due to the hot summer temperatures, it wasn't really an issue for us and I'm sure Karim will handle this. ;) He has a backup for nearly everything and if something isn't working or missing, just let him know.

"Very comfortable accommodations and the location was wonderful! If you want to visit Montreal and Old Montreal, this is the place to stay. The Museum of Fine Arts is a block away, the Metro is close by and the variety of restaurants is amazing!",9.0
"This condo is very well located and comfortable for a single traveler. I appreciated having the space and amenities of a condo. The appointments are sparse - just a few minimal items in the kitchen, which were enough to get by. As others have mentioned, this host is not consistently accessible within the app, but was really responsive via phone. Unlike others, I had absolutely no trouble with the WiFi - that worked great",9.0

"Great host, Karim went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable.  Even if it meant delivering a blowdryer and body wash at 11pm at night and picking us up in the freezing rain and arranging for parking for my car.   

I would recommend staying here, great location and easy access to downtown!",9.0
Nice location and stylish place with a good view. Several amenities like hot shower and sink are broken.,9.0
"I spent six weeks in Marie-Helene's apartment and it was perfect! It was very well located, a short distance from Mont-Royal Avenue, with a supermarket less than 5 minutes walk away. Frontenac metro was 15 minutes away, and Mont-Royal metro was about 20 minutes away (faster if you took the bus that leaves from Mont-Royal avenue). The apartment itself was exactly as shown in the photos and was very clean and well-equipped, it had everything I needed. Marie-Helene was quick to respond to any problems or questions. The next time I need somewhere to stay in Montréal, I won't hesitate to contact Marie-Helene.",10.0
"Once again, Marie was excellent. She provided everything I needed and went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable. This was my second time staying at her place and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Thank you, Marie.",10.0
"We had a great stay in Marie Helene's flat. The flat is well located close to Plateau Mont-Royal, with plenty of shops and many restaurants nearby, and a 2 minute walk to the bus stop (or a 30 minute walk to the Metro station). The flat itself is well-equipped with everything you could need for an extended stay, and tastefully decorated. Marie Helene was very friendly and helpful, and provided us with useful books on the city. We would definitely stay here again next time we visit Montreal.",10.0
"We had a very nice time at Marie-Hélène's apartment. The location is perfect as it is situated in the middle of the Plateau Mont-Royal and not more than 20 minutes from the city center and all the important sights of Montreal! The apartment is clean, modern and tastefully decorated. Fancy restaurants and shops are located just nearby the very frequented Avenue du Mont Royal. 
We totally would go again!",10.0
"I had a wonderful time staying here! The location is wonderful, it's close to shops and transportation, and I found it easy to get around while living there. The apartment is lovely too, all modern and new with everything you need. Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Marie-Hélène, but she was only a text or call away if I needed anything, and her brother who lives upstairs introduced himself and was available if anything was needed. 

Overall, if this is your first visit to Montreal or if you come here often, this place highly recommended.",10.0
"The apartment is great, very well located, completely renovated and equipped. 

It's just a little over one square block from Av Mont-Royal, the central avenue of Plateau. There's a supermarket and bus stop nearby with good metro connection.

The apartment has everything. Fully equipped kitchen even for those who like to cook. 
There is no dryer but really you don't need it because clothes dry very quickly on the line.
I didn't meet Marie-Helene, just her brother. They have always been attentive and responded to what I needed. They left me quite at ease throughout the entire period.

Totally recommend!!!",10.0
"I spent four months with Marie-Hélène. Everything went very well, the apartment was exactly as described, decorated tastefully and quietly. The neighborhood is very pleasant with many shops and grocery stores, La Fontaine Park, good restaurants... However, the apartment is about 20-25 minutes walk from the Mont-Royal metro station. I recommend taking bus number 97 to get there. Marie-Hélène and her brother (who lives above) were very welcoming and helpful.

I highly recommend this apartment and would definitely stay there again!",10.0
"Super location, very cozy, well equipped and with a charming little back balcony.

We can easily feel at home in the apartment and I will definitely return here for my next stay in Montreal!",10.0
"We stayed in the apartment for 6 months in a very quiet and family-friendly neighborhood, just 3 minutes walk from the supermarket and the bus stop. The metro station is easily accessible on foot (a 15/20 minute walk or a 5 minute bus ride) if you enjoy walking a bit. For sports enthusiasts, the gym on the plateau is less than 10 minutes walk ;)",10.0
"I thoroughly enjoyed my month staying at the apartment. It was so quiet, cozy, and secure. I was surprised to find a nearly new front-load washer. It made it very convenient as I didn't travel with a lot of extra clothes. The apartment is well located close to many stores and restaurants. The apartment is supplied with lots of dishes and utensils to cook your own meals. There's plenty of room to have guests stay on the pull-out couch. Several bus lines easily connect to Metro in a matter of minutes. I would recommend that if you don't have a car, pay for a one-month Opus card. I would stay in the apartment again!

"Thank you, Xavier! I arrived very late that night after a contract and the place was exactly as you had described. The neighborhood is very quiet but not far from the city center's lively area. I loved the big trees on the street, full of birds, the bike path. The next morning I really appreciated the neighborhood, there were plenty of cafes to choose from and I finally took the time to go discover the colorful Jean-Talon Market a few blocks away from Xavier's apartment. Thank you again and looking forward to it, Airbnb is so great when you realize that it's so simple to be hosted by welcoming people rather than in the noisy city center :-)",10.0

Both he and Robert were amazing hosts, very friendly and a lot of fun to talk too.

The house is beautiful and in a great location. It was so convenient, with many great coffee shops and restaurants all within walking distance. The train station is also close by, so very easy to get around the city.

I will definitely be coming back to stay there again when I return to Montreal :) 

Their home has been one of my favorite places I've stayed at so far!

I would highly recommend Xavier's place to all travelers.",10.0
"I spent close to a month in this beautiful apartment, where I enjoyed all of its bright and quiet spaces. The neighborhood is tree-lined and largely residential, but bordered by main streets that are full of hang out spots and whatever food one might need. The apartment is within walking distance from many nice parts and parks of Montreal, and accessible by public transportation if one wants to go a bit further. 

Xavier and Robert were really lovely and hospitable, and it was a pleasure to share the apartment with them and their beautiful dog Juliette.",10.0
"Xavier's place is on a quiet side street but close to many interesting sights: Little Italy, the Jean Talon market, lots of small restaurants and cafes, easy access to the orange metro line. 

The room is bright and spacious, decorated in retro style with many little touches (as is the rest of the apartment). There's a really nice semi-closed patio on the back. Excellent value overall! If you like dogs, even better, Juliette is an angel and will let you rub her belly.

Xavier was a great host, he welcomed me warmly and was very helpful in giving me advice on settling down in Montreal. He was respectful and discreet, but didn't hesitate to share a beer and a chat with me. Highly recommended!",10.0
"I was first welcomed by the host, the beautiful and peaceful Juliette, then I was able to meet Xavier and Robert who both allowed me to have excellent moments in their company.

The house is very spacious with a courtyard at the back perfect for ""chilling"" and working in the sun.

Thank you for these 10 days
Sincerely",10.0
"Spacious place to stay and work, I especially enjoyed the patio and backyard - there are so many tables ;) Xavier and Robert are both very friendly and helpful.

The apartment is located near the Beaubien metro station, St Hubert street and Jean Talon market, close to many shops and restaurants. 

Xavier and Robert are welcoming, warm and respectful hosts with whom I had interesting conversations. I will definitely go back there with joy and recommend this accommodation without reservation to my friends.",10.0

The location is wonderful: a quick walk to blue and orange subway (Metro) lines, and right by two very useful bus routes, the 51 and the 165. Also, many stores, restaurants, cafes, etc. in both directions from the building. If value is important, you could hardly do better.",10.0

The apartment was as advertised and also had a new sectional which was a nice touch. There was plenty of street parking and the apartment was located in a nice quiet area, that was a close walking distance to stores and restaurants.",10.0
Adam responded very quickly when we needed a place to stay last minute. He met us within a few hours to show us the apartment and give us the keys. The apartment was exactly as described. It was very close to a bus stop (right outside the front door) and about a 10-minute walk to the Snowdon metro station.,10.0
"Adam's place is even better than what you see when you book. He has all the necessary things you require for your trip and even more, like pasta, olive oil, varieties of tea, sugar, ear buds and even hand soap and body soap.  

The place is very clean, the bathroom is sparkling clean, the linen is washed and smells fresh, the living room is very comfortable to watch TV and just have a relaxing evening.
The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a meal or just put stuff in the oven, the fridge worked very well. The A/c was a blessing as it gets quite warm in summer.

Adam is very quick at communication and always answered the phone when I called him or messaged him. He gave us a very good restaurant recommendation for our anniversary dinner 'Rayan' which specializes in seafood, has very fresh stuff and is decently priced.

Our check-in and checkout was seamless and we had absolutely no problem finding the nearest supermarket, tourist sites, easily accessible public transport, close to old Montreal and downtown. Very close to St. Joseph's oratory. Safe neighborhood at all times of the day. 

Adam is an extremely good host, I would recommend his place anytime to anyone without hesitation.  

Thank you Adam for letting us reserve your place. We hope to book it again when we next visit Montreal.

"Eric's apartment was an excellent choice for our stay in Montreal. What a great location! The neighborhood is close to the excitement of the theater district, restaurants, bars, and museums, but quiet enough to relax at home away from the bustle of the busy downtown. The apartment itself is in excellent condition. We had everything we needed for our stay. All the appliances are new and in good repair, and the furnishings are comfortable and stylish. 

Eric is a wonderful host. He was there to greet us and make sure we got settled in okay. He even checked-in part way through our stay to ask how we were doing, which was very thoughtful. Eric also left us great information about the attractions and amenities around the neighborhood—another thoughtful, personal touch.

If you're looking to stay in a great part of Montreal and have a fantastic host, I happily recommend Eric and his apartment. We already miss ""our Montreal apartment.""",9.0

Everything is perfect!!!",9.0
"Eric's 1-bedroom/1-bathroom condo was in excellent condition - brand new with all the appliances, supplies, and furniture you'd need. The location was great, with easy access to the metro and bus lines.

Eric was very easy to communicate with. He was also very responsive to my questions, and left a binder with very helpful information about the neighborhood and nearby restaurants, shops, even ATMs and delivery menus. He was also very flexible with check-in & check-out times, which we really appreciated.

We had a fantastic stay at Eric's condo in Montreal. I would definitely recommend his place, and would gladly stay there again when we return to Montreal.

"My friend and I enjoyed a very pleasant stay at Eric's condo. The accommodations were immaculately clean and everything we needed was provided to enhance our visit to Montreal. Long-term parking was easy in a nearby garage, so I could park and then explore the city. My friend took the #747 bus from the airport which dropped her off right on Eric's corner. I slept comfortably in the very comfortable bed. My friend chose the couch which folded down into a bed, rather than those pull-out sofa mattresses which can be uncomfortable. The neighborhood seemed to be in transition, but we felt safe and had no difficulties. The location was convenient to Old Montreal, downtown, the entertainment district, and museum area, either walking or by the metro. All in all, an excellent choice.",9.0
"Erick's apartment is the perfect place from which to explore the city of Montreal. It has a Walkscore of 99, a Transit score of 100 and a rider's score of 100, all from (Website hidden by Airbnb) What a location!

You can walk to the old port, the Place des Arts for festivals, Rue St Denis for hundreds of restaurants and bars, etc. 

The main Metro interchange station, Berri UQAM is a few blocks away, which is key to moving around town; check it out on the Montreal Metro map to see what I mean. 

If biking is your thing there is a Bixi (Montreal's public bike rental scheme) stand one block away, $5 for 24 hours.

The building is part of a block that is being gentrified with new, modern apartment buildings. The police station was literally our next-door neighbor and the apartment is facing the police station parking lot, so it must be one of the safest places in downtown Montreal. 

Everything inside the apartment was in as-new condition; the kitchen was very well equipped and Erick was kind enough to leave a full supply of basic items such as dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, toilet paper, etc... so we didn't need to buy anything other than food in the first few days. 

I was there with my wife and two young daughters and the apartment was functional and airy enough that we didn't feel crowded. The sofa bed was perfect for our two daughters to sleep in.

The apartment is on the street level, so I didn't have to lug my bags up a flight of stairs. There was also a privacy finish on the windows and draperies, so that I didn't feel like I was on display to passersby (which there were not many because it is a residential street). Around the corner on the commercial street are many cool shops and eating spots. A couple of blocks to some fantastic restaurants and stores on St. Laurent in one direction and a few more blocks the other way on St. Denis. The Metro was within walking distance and made getting to and from the airport really easy (and inexpensive). Many thanks, Alexandre!",9.0

He met us at the place (we arrived a touch late) and explained the best spot for legal parking. The apartment was very cozy and immaculately clean. Since it was on the first floor (website hidden by Airbnb), it made unloading easy. Their unit was almost too warm, which is great considering the temp in Montreal!

This was my first stay in Montreal and it was the perfect home base for exploring such an awesome city. Zoë was the most gracious host!

The Fairmount Bagel taste is good! :)",10.0
"Zoe's apartment was immaculate and the photos accurately represented it. I really appreciated this because I had just come from another Airbnb which was messy & super-lived in! Getting the keys was easy, and the neighborhood was okay. It's a safe, pretty, residential neighborhood, not at all touristy, which was great -- but there aren't a ton of restaurants & services right nearby, so some might prefer to stay in a neighborhood with more cafes, etc. But the spaciousness & cleanliness of Zoe's very cute apartment were great. 

A couple of things to note: There is a long flight of stairs to the apartment (you enter the front door and then come to the flight of stairs once inside). This would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues, anyone dealing with a young child -- stroller, etc. -- or an elderly person with a cane or walker. 

And although the kitchen had brand-new stove, electric kettle, French press coffee pot, good selection of knives, it would have been wonderful to have a microwave. When you're in a city for only a night or two or three, it's really nice to be able to heat up take-out quickly, without having to bother with the oven. 

The TV had Netflix on it and I watched a movie one night, which was great, and the shower was wonderful. 

But overall, a great place to stay.",10.0

It was clean, and quite big, bigger than we expected--and with a dishwasher, washer/dryer in the basement, etc. It is walking distance to the French restaurants of Outremont, with their terrace seating, and lovely parks/a yummy ice cream parlor/several cafes (we loved Cafe Prague). A little longer walk (but definitely walkable, and we did it with a five-year-old in tow) is Mile End, with a hipster vibe, even more restaurants/bars/and the awesome Drawn and Quarterly bookshop.

Zoe was responsive and kind. Definitely recommended.",10.0
"Zoe's place is beautiful. I would love it if she could decorate our home flat! The neighborhood is great, especially with kids: you are two short blocks from the pool and splash zone at Kennedy Park. You are a bit far to walk from the main resto and bar areas, but there is Bixi at Outremont metro next door so everything is an easy ride (especially Mile End). I would stay again.",10.0

"Zoe was a fantastic host. She was extremely responsive and communicative, as well as very accommodating to our arrival and departure times. We had a fantastic stay at her place. 

The neighborhood is safe and beautiful with easy transportation anywhere in the city. Metro Outremont is a 5-minute walk away, and this apartment is off the main street, but only a 2-minute walk from major bus stops. It's also within walking/biking distance to Bernard Street, and to Mile End, where there are many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

For future users, Zoe has recently renovated the dining and kitchen space, and it's so much more modern, open, and beautiful than the old photos still up. Our 2.5-year-old son loved playing in this newly renovated space. 

We would definitely come back! We hope you love this apartment as much as we did!",10.0

Zoé is a very available host who answers our questions very quickly and warmly.
Don't hesitate if you want to stay in this beautiful city of Montreal.",10.0
"Zoe's apartment was fantastic for my husband and two little girls. We very much enjoyed having a place that was so comfortable, spacious, and well-designed away from home. The kitchen and bathroom have been renovated since the pictures in the profile were taken and both were done very well. Zoe's apartment is in a great location, near Bernard St., Miles End, and a short ride downtown. When we come back to Montreal, we would definitely stay here again.",10.0
"Zoe's place is stunning, much bigger than we expected and very comfortable with a new bathroom (great shower!) and a balcony as well. Outremont is a great little neighborhood, the apartment is close to the metro, lots of good restaurants and bakeries nearby. I joked I should probably move to Montreal and rent from her permanently! Zoe was very helpful before our arrival, and is easy to get a hold of. I would certainly stay here again.",10.0

"LeCube was amazing! It was, in fact, a cube. But for anyone who doesn't need a kitchen - this is perfect. I rented a room with a balcony and it was fantastic. The room was beautifully set up, immaculate, the bed was comfy and best of all - the shower was really, really nice. haha. I will definitely rent from them again, when I am back in town.",10.0
"Where to even begin. Staying at leqube was by far one of the best and most memorable experiences we've had using Airbnb and through traveling in general.

The first thing that captivated us and the reason we chose to stay here was their design, style, and layout of the property. Sophisticated yet minimal, clean, simple, modern, cool, and easy. 

The people behind leqube really went out their way to think of what a guest could need during their stay, everything was excellent and better than described in the listing.

The whole check-in and check-out experience was fast, seamless, and simple and didn't require any interaction with the host; however, they are available to help at a moment's notice if you might need it. The room comes with everything listed, and yes, the Apple TV and Netflix combo is a cool and modern feature to have. Almost forgot to mention they have a rooftop lounge with ping pong and hot tub.

Apart from the overall amazing trip we had in Montreal, one of the reasons that made it so magical and made this particular city so memorable in our minds was having a place like leqube to call our home away from home for the weekend.

Counting down the days to our next trip to Montreal and our next stay at leqube.",10.0

"We loved our stay at leQube. The staff were friendly, super helpful and communicative. The room was clean, fresh and comfortable. We loved the Nespresso machine in the lobby, as well as the tea. There is a fridge in the lobby where you can leave food if you label it. The location is within walking distance of many restaurants and shops but a bit of a walk to the Metro if you want to head elsewhere. That said the streets were so beautiful in the surrounding area we enjoyed the walk and ended up finding new restaurants and shops to explore along the way. We would definitely come back!",10.0

"My friends and I booked three units at LeQube and were all blown away! The place is amazingly decorated, in a great location close to restaurants, shops, bars, etc. The rooms were clean and modern and very well done and the self check-in/check-out was a breeze.  Beyond that, the little things really put this place over the top, from magazines, books, fresh fruit, coffee, and (Website hidden by Airbnb) yoga mats, which the girls used to do yoga on the rooftop each morning. We will definitely seek out more LeQube locations for our future travels. Trust me, book this place!",10.0
"Translation: Very good stay in Montreal! Great location, quiet neighborhood close to all amenities (2 metro stations nearby, restaurants and bars...). Trendy decor and responsive hosts. Highly recommend!",10.0
"LeQube is a fantastic option for light travelers! Great location - right along a residential street and steps from Duluth Ave and all its boutiques and brasseries. Easy walk to St Laurent and St Denis streets. Modest sized rooms, but very well maintained - Cozy and clean space. If the parking spot is available (slightly extra cost) I highly recommend - street parking can be a little tricky on St Hubert with the restrictions...and if your French is a little shaky :) Overall a great value and option in a great city!",10.0
"LeQuebe is very stylish, clean, and located in a prime location in Montreal. Although there was not a lot of staff present, the access code entry and checkup emails made me feel safe and cared for. I would highly recommend it for someone looking for hotel quality without the high cost!",10.0

LeQube is located in a lovely neighborhood, and I always felt safe leaving the apartment.
The room decor was charming. I enjoyed the shower.
I was initially surprised by the size of the apartment. It was slightly smaller than I expected, but I understand that this is common in Montreal, and the overall value for the money is amazing.",10.0
"LeQube was one of my favorite Airbnbs yet. The room was spotless, chic, and had a ton of space available to keep our luggage out of sight while we were there. This place also has a rooftop hot tub with a view of the city. 

If you're trying to get out the door quickly, they even offer some hot coffee/tea, croissants, and juice, such a nice touch. Most places were within walking distance. And at the very most, you're going to have a 15-minute walk to the main part of the city. Response time was incredibly quick. Although parking isn't offered for every guest, it's easy to find in the area, and we never parked more than a 1-2 minute walk from LeQube. We will definitely be staying here the next time we are in Montreal.",10.0

The hosts are incredibly responsive! The room and bathroom were both clean and comfortable. During our stay, the hot tub was undergoing repairs.

The apt. is warm & inviting, beds comfortable, all amenities were provided. It is within walking distance of nearly everything one would want to do - plenty of restaurants, nightlife, parks, shops. And although Jiji & Alex were out of town, they arranged for someone to meet my friend and me as soon as we arrived and get us settled in. There were even bagels & schmear waiting on the counter- so thoughtful! They left the numbers of local contacts should we need immediate assistance and Jiji kept in touch via email throughout the visit. She responded quickly and with detail - giving suggestions on what we should do in the area based on our list of interests. Jiji and Alex truly have a gift for hospitality - I highly recommend staying here should you venture to Montreal!",10.0
"Although Jiji and Alex were away during our stay, they provided a seamless and gracious backup plan for our arrival. Their mom and sister were super helpful in orienting us to the place.

"Having stayed in many Airbnbs over the last two years, Jihane was the most responsive, easy to contact, and friendliest host I've interacted with. The apartment is close to so many amenities. A couple things to be aware of for the summer, there is a lot of noise from the street with the windows open and the bedrooms get a lot of light. If you are sensitive to those things, bring earplugs and a sleep mask. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need.",10.0

"Benjamin was a lovely host. This was my first time using instant booking and I have to admit I was a little nervous initially because I didn't get a reply until the third day after initial message. But it turns out it was a minor miscommunication, and communication onwards was pretty good. The fiancé and I stayed for 3 days/2 nights and enjoyed ourselves. The apartment was easily commutable from the airport, conveniently located for shopping and food, modern and well-stocked with supplies. We had arrived earlier than our check-in time and Benjamin met up with us to take our bags until it was time to check in, very nice gesture and saved us from lugging our bags in the snow! I would definitely stay here again. Thanks again, Benjamin!!!",10.0

"I stayed at this lovely studio with my best friend for 6 days! We absolutely loved it! It was very clean and had a nice kitchenette, saving us a LOT of money because we were able to cook some delicious meals and eat out less. On another yummy note, there are a bunch of coffee shops, pubs, bars, and outlet stores all within a couple's blocks of this studio's location on Rue Crescent. We enjoyed getting a morning crepe or croissant from Paris Crepe right down at the end of the block once or twice! It's also a cheap cab ride away for Rue Saint Laurent if you're looking to take part in Montréal's vibrant nightlife. My friend and I both like to walk so we walked to both Old Montreal and Mount Royal on two separate days. However, if you're less keen on walking a couple of miles for some good and fun exercise and get to know the city a bit, the metro station is just a block or two away. It's super easy to get around the city via public transportation especially from this apartment! I'd recommend this listing to anyone who's looking for a good central location to explore Montréal!  It's amazing!",10.0

"Awesome place in an awesome city. The apartment was immaculate. The building is brand new. It was a spacious studio that was very comfortable for my fiancé and I. It came stocked with most of the normal living amenities, from laundry detergent and trash bags to paper towels and olive oil. There was even a little coffee maker that I used every morning. Although there's an outstanding coffee spot, Cafe Myriade, just a couple blocks over, I highly recommend it. Ben was great, always responsive and very out of the picture. It felt very much like a hotel experience (which is what we were looking for) at a fraction of the price.

The area felt extremely safe even late at night. It's at the intersection of a street with bars/pubs/clubs and the busiest shopping street in the city. It's central to everything. The two main subway lines are just a few blocks away. This is the ideal location for your first time in Montreal. Walking distance from Mount Royal.",10.0

The photos are very accurate and the building is great too. Elevator, great washer, dryer and amenities were a big bonus.",10.0

It's very easy to get around, as everything is within walking distance. 

Great restaurants and grocery stores are also nearby.",10.0
"When my boyfriend and I arrived in Montreal, Benjamin made it easy and convenient to pick up the keys. There was NOTHING inconvenient about staying at Benjamin's condo. It is in a clean, modern building steps away from St. Catherine's. There are many thoughtful things around the condo that we were grateful to find; including an umbrella large enough to cover two people. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience that the condo provided us... but the biggest surprise was when my boyfriend proposed to me on the balcony!! The fact that he chose that spot to pop the question should speak for itself.",10.0
Very central location in Montreal -- Benjamin takes great care of the place (it is very clean!) and is super-responsive. Full kitchen and very comfortable bed. I highly recommend it.,10.0
"Benjamin's place was perfect! Very comfortable, modern, and clean. And the location was perfect. He was a fantastic host too! Very responsive, helpful, and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.",10.0
"Ben's place was a great hub for our trip to Montreal. His condo is perfectly located very close to many shops, restaurants, and bars. The Bell Centre is just a few blocks away and public transportation was easy to use from our condo. Ben was waiting for us outside as we arrived and is very responsive when we contacted him at the airport. The condo has all the amenities of a nice hotel, and you will feel at home here while visiting Montreal. Highly recommend staying here while visiting this beautiful city. Thanks Ben!",10.0

"We spent 4 wintry days in Montreal and the comfort of Benjamin's place made it that much more magical. We truly felt at home and couldn't have asked for more from his accommodations and from him. Even after we had checked in, he was still available to answer questions about the city and things we could do! We'll definitely be back!",10.0
The stay was great! Prompt communication and the location was central to all major attractions in Montreal. Highly recommended!,10.0
"If you want to be in the heart of the city, this is the spot. One minute walk to St. Catherine St. and a 5-minute walk to Bell Centre. Everything was perfect! Benjamin met us promptly, showed us the condo and answered any questions I had immediately. We will be back!! Thank you Benjamin!",10.0
"Nice place and very helpful hosts. We were very comfortable and our hosts were easy to contact with questions. They gave us an overview of the area when we arrived so that we'd know where to go for groceries, buses, and trains. We had a great stay!",9.0
"We are a family of 4 people and we have traveled with our two children aged 9 and 14 years old. We had a very warm welcome despite the delay we experienced at the airport and a capricious GPS...

Guy and his wife were extremely friendly throughout our stay and readily available if needed.

They managed to make us feel at ease immediately. The apartment is completely in line with the descriptions and photos of the listing. It is clean, quiet, comfortable and close to all amenities. We highly recommend it; we will definitely return without hesitation!

A big thank you to Guy and his wife",9.0
"""Wonderful stay with Guy for my family. The hotel is very accessible and accommodating, responding quickly and offering personalized little touches. The quiet neighborhood is very close to Lafontaine Park and an ideal location for visiting the plateau and downtown. Spacious and very clean apartment: excellent value for money. There's nothing else to say except that Guy and his family are very friendly and I highly recommend this place to my friends and family for a future stay!""",9.0

We had a great stay!",9.0
"We had a pleasant stay in this apartment.
Guy was very available and very helpful. 
We will definitely return.",9.0
Guy's place was great to stay at. He was easy to communicate with and the place was just as described. The only little hiccup was that we were told after arriving that we needed to check out by noon even though on the listing it says 6pm. This was not an issue for us because we were going to check out early anyways but it would have been nice to know in advance and not after we got there.,9.0
"We were warmly received by Guy upon our arrival, and he is available during our stay if we need him. The apartment is well-located, close to important sites and neighborhoods worth visiting. It is well-equipped, and the beds are comfortable. If I had to point out a negative aspect, it would be the kitchen which could use a little refresh. 

Our stay was pleasant and we recommend this accommodation.",9.0
"My brother and I stayed at Guys's place for 4 nights. Guy was very easy to communicate with. Check-in was easy, and Guy's wife met us at the door. Guy and his wife live upstairs, so it's very easy if assistance is needed. The apartment was as described on the website. It was very clean and well-equipped. Two queen-size beds were very comfortable. The bedrooms are at the back and very quiet. The location is perfect. In the Plateau and close to public transit and buses. We both enjoyed this apartment immensely and highly recommend it for two couples or traveling companions. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Guy!",9.0
"We were very well received by Guy and his family. We enjoyed a spacious, pleasant, clean, well-equipped and well-located accommodation for three days. Without any hesitation, we would recommend this accommodation to our loved ones.",9.0
"I loved this location and the home was beautiful and spacious. The neighborhood was quiet. The only downside was the construction in the area caused transit detours that made public transportation difficult. However, for its proximity to everything, I would stay here again and again!",9.0
"Great time in Montreal, Guy is helpful host. Beautiful and spacious place. The apartment has everything close to all the places in Plateau Mont-Royal.",9.0
"My three friends and I had a great experience staying at Guy's apartment. Guy was very hospitable in pointing out things we might need during our stay, providing maps and information, etc., and was flexible with our check-in and checkout times. He was very accessible if we needed to ask him anything, as he lives right upstairs. The apartment was very spacious and just as represented in the pictures. We cooked a few times and had everything we needed in the kitchen. We especially loved the neighborhood, which is very calm, quiet, and family-friendly; there's a primary school just across the street. It was a bit further than we expected to get to the heart of downtown, but we felt like it was worth it for how great the place was; it was sort of a nice retreat from the busy city center Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone interested in visiting the city!",9.0
We enjoyed our stay in this flat and would highly recommend it to other travelers.,9.0
He was very nice. The apartment was very clean! Great guy,9.0
"Guy is a very sociable and friendly person. The accommodation is very well located for everything. There's a small convenience store 2 minutes from the accommodation! It's a 30-minute drive to Old Montreal and Old Port, and a 30-minute drive to Mount Royal plateau. Many small restaurants are located near the accommodation and offer great value for money! Our favorite little spots: Chez ma grosse truie chérie, the bistro on Rue de la Rivière (reservations required) for the poutine! The accommodation is well served by bus lines, especially designed to make 3 dollars 25! Or buy a pass for your stay; it covers both buses and the metro.",9.0
